## Comprehensive Report: Fracture – A Civic Intelligence Platform (Dynamic Synthesis Edition)

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** April 16, 2025
**Based On:** Original `description.txt`, `bigplan.txt`, discussions on two-stage AI architecture.

**Preamble:** In a world grappling with epistemic fragmentation, political theater, and institutional mistrust—a landscape profoundly shaped by narrative warfare and the proliferation of AI-driven (mis/dis)information—Fracture emerges not as a unifier of broken narratives, but as an observatory built within the cracks. It’s a platform designed not merely to present information, but to illuminate the _processes_ by which narratives are constructed, contested, and gain traction[cite: 131]. This report details Fracture's refined design, architected around a sophisticated **two-stage AI system**: a powerful backend proactively generates a rich cache of diverse analytical perspectives, which are then dynamically retrieved and synthesized by a frontend AI to deliver tailored insights, training users in the essential 21st-century skills: tracing power, recognizing framing, and interpreting ambiguity with resilience[cite: 132].

### Executive Summary

Fracture transcends conventional news feeds by offering a sophisticated, dual-mode user experience: **Scroll Down (Recognize)** for rapid, contextualized awareness of daily events via concise summaries and "sparks", and **Scroll Right (Interpret)** for an immersive, dynamically synthesized exploration of underlying dynamics, power plays, and competing narratives[cite: 133]. The platform maintains its focus on critical geopolitical and economic arenas and key actors[cite: 134].

In the challenging informational climate of 2025, Fracture’s core educational mission remains: training users to identify significant "sparks," understand diverse analytical frames, and hold competing truths with critical clarity [cite: 135, 153-155]. This vision is powered by a novel two-stage AI architecture:

1.  **Proactive Backend Analysis:** Daily, an **enhanced hybrid RAG system** retrieves deep historical context (semantic, entity-based, event patterns, structured data) for ~50 key news summaries/clusters. This context fuels a powerful LLM (`gemini-2.5-pro-exp`) to generate **~1250 distinct analytical snippets** – representing 5 different variations for each of the 5 conceptual layers of analysis (Recap, Theories, Correlations, Ambiguities, Counter-Narratives). These snippets, along with their embeddings, form a rich, pre-computed "analysis cache".
2.  **Dynamic Frontend Synthesis:** When a user explores an event (Scroll Right), a **frontend RAG system** retrieves the most relevant pre-computed analysis snippets from the cache based on the user's context or query. A faster, cost-effective LLM (`gemini-2.0-flash`) then **synthesizes these diverse snippets into a tailored, coherent response** presented directly to the user.

Supporting roles are played by `gemini-2.0-flash` and local NLP tools for initial processing, daily summary generation, and RAG context preparation [cite: 12-17, 60-65]. Data resides in PostgreSQL with `pgvector`[cite: 96].

Fracture is thus positioned as an advanced cognitive simulator and civic intelligence tool. Its success lies in demonstrably improving users' narrative literacy, critical interpretation skills, and resilience against manipulation in a complex world[cite: 145].

### 1. Core Purpose (Rearticulated for Dynamic Synthesis)

Fracture's purpose is sharpened: to actively _train_ critical faculties by leveraging AI to both pre-analyze complexity and synthesize insights on demand:

1.  **Trace Power:** Equip users to map influence networks by synthesizing historical entity actions, interactions, and influence trends retrieved from the knowledge base via RAG[cite: 147].
2.  **Recognize Framing:** Train users to deconstruct narratives by proactively generating analyses from multiple theoretical/ideological lenses (5 variations per layer) and dynamically synthesizing relevant perspectives [cite: 149-150, 180].
3.  **Interpret Ambiguity:** Foster sense-making under uncertainty by highlighting information gaps, contradictions, and speculative angles within the proactively generated analysis snippets and synthesizing them when relevant [cite: 151-152, 174].
4.  **See Sparks:** Generate initial concise summaries with AI-powered "sparks" (using efficient models) to draw users into deeper, dynamically synthesized exploration [cite: 153-154, 162].
5.  **Hold Competing Truths:** Develop cognitive resilience by exposing users to multiple, valid, pre-analyzed perspectives (the 5 variations per layer) synthesized into coherent responses that showcase structured disagreement[cite: 155, 180].

### 2. Core Structure: Recognize & Interpret (Dynamic Edition)

The dual-interface structure remains, but the "Interpret" mode is fundamentally transformed:

**2.1 Scroll Down: Recognize**

- **Purpose:** Rapid situational awareness[cite: 157]. Identify key events, actors, and initial frames/sparks.
- **Format:** Vertically scrolling feed of ~50 concise summaries daily[cite: 159]. Each summary (~50-70 words) includes key entities, data points, and an AI-generated "spark".
- **Generation:** Generated efficiently, likely using `gemini-2.0-flash` in batch mode, focusing on clarity and the spark.

**2.2 Scroll Right: Interpret (Dynamic Synthesis)**

- **Purpose:** Guided exploration into the complexities surrounding an event, tailored to the user's focus[cite: 166]. Answer "Why?", "Who benefits?", "What's missing?".
- **Format:** Horizontally scrolling or interactive interface linked to a News Feed item. Instead of static layers, the content is _generated on interaction_.
- **Mechanism:**
  1.  User interaction (click, query) defines context.
  2.  **Frontend RAG:** Retrieves relevant pre-computed analysis snippets (from the 1250 daily generated fragments) based on context embedding and/or filters (layer, lens).
  3.  **AI Synthesis (`gemini-2.0-flash`):** Synthesizes the retrieved snippets into a coherent, tailored response answering the user's implicit or explicit query.
  4.  **Presentation:** Displays the synthesized analysis, potentially allowing further interaction to explore different facets (e.g., "Show me the Realist perspective", "Focus on ambiguities").

### 3. Key Design Philosophies (Enabled by Two-Stage AI)

- **Drama as Clarity:** Initial sparks (generated by `flash`) draw users in; tailored synthesis provides clarity on demand[cite: 179].
- **Multiperspectivalism:** Proactively generating 5 variations per layer using `pro-exp` builds deep diversity; frontend synthesis presents relevant facets of this diversity[cite: 180].
- **Theory as Canvas:** Theoretical lenses explicitly drive variations in the proactive analysis stage; synthesis can surface theory-driven insights relevant to the user's query[cite: 181].

### 4. Key Features (Two-Stage Architecture)

- **Scroll Down (Recognize):** AI-Generated Summaries & Sparks (efficiently via `flash`).
- **Scroll Right (Interpret):**
  - _Proactive Multi-Analysis Cache (Backend):_ ~1250 diverse snippets generated daily using enhanced RAG + `gemini-2.5-pro-exp`.
  - _Dynamic Frontend RAG:_ Retrieves relevant cached snippets based on user interaction.
  - _Tailored AI Synthesis (Frontend):_ `gemini-2.0-flash` generates coherent responses from retrieved snippets.
  - _Interactive Exploration:_ UI allows users to guide the synthesis or explore different facets of the cached analysis.

### 5. Data Model as Narrative Infrastructure

- The core tables (`articles`, `entities`, `clusters`, `embeddings`) remain foundational.
- **Crucially:** A new structure (e.g., `analysis_snippets` table or enhanced `essays` table) stores the ~1250 proactively generated analysis snippets, including their `content`, `layer`, `variation_index`, `analytical_lens`, source links, and crucially, their **embeddings** to power frontend RAG[cite: 192]. This cache _is_ the deep narrative infrastructure.

### 6. User Experience (Dynamic Interpretation)

- **Scroll Down (Recognize):** Remains a quick overview (~30 mins) to identify key events and sparks.
- **Scroll Right (Interpret):** Becomes an interactive dialogue. Instead of reading static layers, the user receives synthesized answers tailored to their focus, drawn from a deep well of pre-analyzed perspectives. The challenge is designing the UI to make this interaction intuitive and prevent information overload when presenting synthesized views from potentially conflicting snippets.

### 7. Technical Backbone (Two-Stage AI)

- **Stage 1: Proactive Backend Analysis (Daily Batch):**
  - _Input:_ ~50 Top Priority Summaries/Articles.
  - \*Context:\*\* Enhanced RAG (Embeddings, Entities, Clusters, Structured Data via Postgres/pgvector, potentially supported by `flash` calls).
  - _Generation:_ ~1250 calls to `gemini-2.5-pro-exp` using specific prompts for 5 layers x 5 variations.
  - _Output:_ ~1250 Analysis Snippets stored with text embeddings (e.g., in `analysis_snippets` table).
  - _Supporting:_ `gemini-2.0-flash` / Local NLP for initial summaries and RAG context prep.
- **Stage 2: Frontend Synthesis (On User Interaction):**
  - _Trigger:_ User interaction (click/query).
  - _Retrieval:_ Frontend RAG queries snippet embeddings (`pgvector` search on `analysis_snippets`).
  - _Synthesis:_ `gemini-2.0-flash` call synthesizes retrieved snippets into a tailored response.
  - _Display:_ Response shown in UI.
- **Supporting Infrastructure:** PostgreSQL + `pgvector`, Python backend, Task Queues (for backend generation), Scalable Cloud Infrastructure (handling 1250 Pro calls daily + frontend traffic), Robust Monitoring.

### 8. Success Metrics (Unchanged Framework)

- The core framework focusing on Cognitive Shift, Narrative Recognition, Civic Empowerment remains valid, measuring the effectiveness of the _final synthesized output_ in achieving these goals.

### 9. Political & Civic Function (Unchanged Goal)

- Aims to reshape perceptions of legitimacy and serve as a training ground for advanced civic literacy[cite: 217].

### 10. Why It Works (New Rationale)

- **Unparalleled Depth:** Proactive analysis by the most powerful model captures extreme nuance and multiple perspectives upfront.
- **Tailored Relevance & Performance:** Frontend RAG + Synthesis delivers precisely relevant insights quickly, without expensive on-the-fly generation.
- **Cost Efficiency (Relative):** Concentrates expensive computation offline; uses cheaper models for user-facing interaction.
- **Structured Exploration:** Provides a framework (layers, variations) for exploring complexity systematically.
- **Scalability:** The proactive analysis cache can grow, and the synthesis layer can be refined independently.
