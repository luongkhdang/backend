Success Metrics for the Platform: A Civic and Cognitive Framework
I. Core Framework: Three Axes of Impact

1. Cognitive Shift (How Users Learn to Think)
   Are users becoming more skeptical, but not cynical?

Are they distinguishing between speculation and fact?

Are they learning to hold competing interpretations simultaneously?

2. Narrative Recognition (How Users See Power)
   Are users recognizing patterns across domains (e.g., finance, policy, media)?

Can they identify narrative tactics (e.g., omission, framing, repetition)?

Are they tracing influence—not just reading about events?

3. Civic Empowerment (How Users Engage)
   Are users more confident in their understanding of political events?

Are they contributing interpretations, not just consuming?

Are they spreading nuanced takes, not just hot takes?

II. Measurable Indicators (Concrete KPIs by Category)

1. Interpretive Depth
   % of users who interact with 3+ Rabbit Hole layers on a single event (engagement with depth)

% of essays where users click on multiple theory tags or competing interpretations

Average time spent on Rabbit Hole after spark layer (measuring pull-through beyond spectacle)

2. Pattern Literacy
   % of users who interact with cross-domain entities (e.g., “Jack Ma” in both economic and political clusters)

Number of users engaging with cluster-based navigation vs linear scroll

% of users who correctly answer a voluntary quiz embedded periodically:

"Which of these stories shares a cluster with the Vietnam trade deal?"

3. Framing Recognition
   % of users who engage with opposing theory tags on the same event (e.g., realism + liberalism)

Volume of user-submitted Rabbit Hole additions or flags (user interpreting the system, not just using it)

Ratio of speculation vs. fact-tagged content bookmarked or shared

4. Civic Orientation
   % of users who use the “Disagree?” or “Suggest another angle” feature

User submissions of alternative framing (e.g., “This isn’t about trade, this is about tech hegemony”)

% of users who visit the Glossary of Theories/Framing and later interact with content tagged by it

III. Higher-Order Strategic Metrics (Signal, Not Noise)

1. Institutional Adoption
   Number of courses (e.g., high school civics, political science) using the app or Rabbit Hole model in their curriculum

Requests from media, academics, or political organizations to use or license the cluster/entity/tag data

2. Cross-Ideological Trust
   Surveyed user trust ratings across ideological identity

E.g., “Do you believe this platform tries to push an agenda?”

Percentage of flagged “bias” cases resolved through theory-tag clarification or alternate framing—not content removal

3. Viral Sparks with Interpretive Integrity
   % of shared sparks (on X, TikTok, etc.) that carry a linked Rabbit Hole (not just the quote or dramatized summary)

Engagement ratio between spark and follow-through:

Did the user just read the spark? Or did they explore the full chain of meaning?

IV. The Final Layer: Long-Term Epistemic Resilience
These are harder to measure, but essential to your legacy.

Repeat Users’ Theory Recognition Index

Year-on-year increase in users’ correct association of theories to framings

(“This framing is realist.” “This is a constructivist interpretation.”)

Civic Spillover

% of users who report, in voluntary surveys, that they’ve:

Changed how they read traditional media

Engaged in a deeper political discussion due to a Rabbit Hole insight

Felt less manipulated by news, more able to “see the framing”

Misuse Cases

Number of Rabbit Hole entries flagged for distortion or ideological hijacking

System response time and resolution transparency

Evidence that the platform’s design discouraged echo chamber behavior, even during viral events

Closing Measure: The Stanford Test
Ask your sharpest students—those trained in debate, philosophy, and critical theory—to use the platform for 30 days. Then ask them:

“Did it make you smarter—or just more informed?”
“Did it make you more open-minded—or more entrenched?”
“Did it make you feel equipped—or overwhelmed?”

Their answers will be the ultimate benchmark.
