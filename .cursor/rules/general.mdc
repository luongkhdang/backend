# Your rule content

use [reader_db_client.py](mdc:src/database/reader_db_client.py) to handle data (query, filter, .. )

DO NOT EVER USE DUMMY/FALLBACK DATA. IN THIS PROJECT, IT IS IMPORTANT TO RAISE ERROR AND NEVER TO USE DYMMY NOR FALLBACK DATA. I MIGHT GO TO JAIL IF WE DO.

At the top of each file, include a concise, informative header comment summarizing the file's purpose and key details. The header must include:
- A brief description of the file’s functionality or role.
- A list of exported functions/classes with their parameters (including type annotations), return types, and required arguments. Adopt the type restriction from Typescript strictly.
- A list of immediately related files (e.g., dependencies or files that directly interact with this one).
Use a consistent format (e.g., docstring or block comment) and keep it under 10 lines unless complexity demands more. Update the header if the file’s purpose or dependencies change.
