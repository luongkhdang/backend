# Gemini Embedding Clustering Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing clustering of article embeddings using the Gemini text-embedding-004 model.

## Overview

After generating embeddings for articles in Step 1.6, a future step will involve clustering these articles based on their vector representations. This clustering will help identify groups of related articles without requiring manual tagging.

## Clustering Approach

1. **Data Preparation**:

   - Query all articles with embeddings
   - Extract embedding vectors and article IDs

2. **Clustering Algorithm Options**:

   - K-means clustering: Efficient for large datasets, requires specifying number of clusters upfront
   - DBSCAN: Density-based clustering, good for discovering clusters of arbitrary shape
   - Hierarchical clustering: Creates a tree-like structure of clusters

3. **Implementation Details**:

   - Use optimized clustering implementation (scikit-learn)
   - Consider dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, UMAP) for visualization
   - Evaluate cluster quality with metrics like silhouette score

4. **Database Storage**:
   - Store cluster assignments in the `cluster_id` field of the `articles` table
   - Store cluster centroids in the `clusters` table
   - Update `is_hot` flag for clusters with high article activity

## Task Types for Gemini Embeddings

The Gemini API supports different task types for optimizing embeddings:

- `SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY`: Optimized to assess text similarity
- `CLUSTERING`: Optimized to cluster texts based on similarities
- `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`: Optimized for document search/retrieval

For article clustering, the `CLUSTERING` task type will be most appropriate.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Clustering**:

   - Re-cluster periodically as new articles are added
   - Implement incremental clustering to avoid reprocessing all articles

2. **Topic Extraction**:

   - Generate topic labels for each cluster using summarization techniques
   - Extract key entities and concepts from each cluster

3. **Visualization**:

   - Create 2D/3D visualizations of article clusters
   - Build an interactive dashboard for exploring clusters

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Implement feedback mechanism for cluster quality
   - Fine-tune clustering parameters based on feedback
