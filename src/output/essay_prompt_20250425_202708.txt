  Title: Spain unveils €11bn plan to reach long-delayed Nato defence spending target
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-22 13:24:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: Spain's increased defense spending, spurred by pressure from NATO and the perceived threat from Russia ('vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security'), aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize their security in an anarchic international system. This action demonstrates a shift towards self-reliance and power balancing within Europe.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Spain's commitment to increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP, but also mentions criticism from coalition partners who describe the plans as 'incoherent and absolutely exorbitant.' This suggests internal political divisions regarding defense priorities and resource allocation. What are the specific concerns of the coalition partners, and how might these internal disagreements affect the implementation and effectiveness of the defense plan?

  Content: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year, saying it has become obvious only europe will know how to protect europe from now on. the country which lags well behind other western nations by dedicating about 1.3 of its gdp to defence spending is one of the nato members that has been pressured by the trump administration to increase its spending, and had previously committed to hitting the 2 threshold by 2029. but speaking on tuesday morning, spains prime minister, pedro sánchez, unveiled a 10.5bn 9bn industrial and technological plan for security and defence that will allow spain to meet the 2 commitment in 2025. sánchez said the plan, which has been approved by his cabinet and will now be submitted to the eu and nato, was needed to address the current and future defence challenges. its main focus will be telecommunications, cybersecurity and buying military equipment. the enemies of europe are not just using missiles as we have seen in ukraine over the past three years, he said. theyre also using unmanned drones and paramilitary forces to sabotage supply chains and to cut gas lines and underwater cables. theyre using social networks to issue disinformation and to polarise people and spread disaffection towards democratic institutions. theyre using ai cyber-attacks and quantum computers to compromise out telecommunications, our supply networks, and our public services in order to target our way of life. the prime minister who pointed out that his administration was finally making good on the 2 commitment pledged by its conservative predecessor in 2014 said the new plan would help reinforce european security in record time. in a world thats dominated by uncertainty, europe is hope and it is certainty and that certainty must be protected by strengthening our security and defence systems because given whats going on, its obvious that only europe will know how to protect europe, he added. and spain will contribute to protecting europe. sánchez said vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security, no matter how far any eu member state was from the frontlines of the conflict in ukraine. the security and stability of ukraine, of eastern europe and the baltic and nordic countries, is also the security and the safety of spain, he said. the people who live in those countries know that putin is serious and that his words are backed by deeds and thats why they look to europe for protection. theyre looking for something important, and that is unity. spain will not be indifferent to that demand. ukraine resists, europe responds and spain fulfils its obligations. sánchez also repeated his assurances that the additional spending would not lead to increased taxes, raids on the welfare state budget, or deficit increases. the plan has faced criticism from coalition partners in the leftwing sumar platform, who described the plans as incoherent and absolutely exorbitant. in january, donald trump increased pressure on nato, claiming the us had shouldered the global defence burden for too long and saying he would ask all nato members to increase defence spending to 5 of gdp. the nato secretary-general, mark rutte, has urged member states to use the threats from washington as an incentive to take unilateral action on raising defence contributions. last month, rutte said the pressure was already paying off in countries such as spain, portugal, belgium and italy. i tell them that, well, now i am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2 by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2 because we have to spend much, much more than 2 but now i am calling you, but you might get a very, erm, patient man from washington on the line if you dont listen to me, he said.

  Title: Bank of England rate-setter says US tariffs likely to push down on inflation
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 11:13:59)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article touches upon aspects of Realism in international relations, specifically concerning trade and tariffs. The US imposing tariffs on the UK, as mentioned in the text ('the us has imposed a 10 import tariff on goods coming from the uk, a policy which also applies to many other countries'), exemplifies a state acting in its perceived self-interest to protect its economy, regardless of the impact on other nations. This action, and the UK's subsequent economic considerations, reflect the competitive and often conflictual nature of international trade relations as described by Realist theory.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents Megan Greene's analysis of potential disinflationary effects of US tariffs on the UK, but also acknowledges 'a tonne of uncertainty around this.' This uncertainty, coupled with the mention of 'both inflationary and disinflationary forces,' suggests a more complex and potentially volatile economic situation than a simple cause-and-effect narrative. What specific factors contribute most to this uncertainty, and how might they interact to produce unexpected economic outcomes?; Intriguing_angles: The opening section discusses the importance of 'parsing out the facts from the messaging' in the context of US politics, while the latter part focuses on economic analysis of UK inflation. This juxtaposition, while seemingly unrelated, could subtly imply that economic narratives are also subject to manipulation or biased framing. To what extent might political messaging influence the interpretation and presentation of economic data, and what mechanisms might facilitate such influence?

  Title: How might Trump tariffs affect UK business on ‘Liberation Day’?
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-01 23:32:28)

story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for

americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. liberation day as the white house grandly calls the unveiling of its new trade policy is finally upon us. but what it actually means and what the impact will be is still not clear, as president donald trump keeps businesses and world leaders waiting until wednesday to unveil the next round of tariffs. while mr trump has suggested all nations will be hit with additional levies and sir keir starmer has admitted the uk is unlikely to escape the new measures its still far from certain exactly which industries will bear the brunt this time, with steel, aluminium and auto parts already subject to additional import costs. heres a look at whats already known, what could happen, and what investors are doing as uncertainty reigns. the top end of the uk stock market has performed relatively well this year, considering concerns over growth, inflation, still-high interest rates and the wider geopolitical landscape. the ftse 100 is up more than 5 per cent year-to-date, in contrast to the us sp 500 being down around the same amount. the uncertainty has hit smaller businesses more, with the ftse 250 down 5.2 per cent in 2025 and the aim all-share index down 4.3 per cent. more recently, while there was a sell-off on monday ahead of these new tariffs, it eventually wasnt as steep as had initially looked the case and tuesday saw investors buying once more on price weaknesses, perhaps hinting that some saw limited further downside in share price terms, even with new tariffs to come. it has always been a fools game at guessing the stock markets most immediate, very next move, but aj bell analysis notes that while the biggest tech stocks in america the so-called magnificent seven have lost a combined 2.3 trillion in the first quarter of this year, they have strong growth prospects well into the future and that status makes them natural candidates to attract widespread buying when markets are more upbeat. in the uk, defence stocks in particular have fared strongly so far, with a domestic political strategy based on increased spending in this area pushing share prices higher while the price of gold, a traditional safe haven for investors, has repeatedly hit new record highs this year and is predicted by some analysts to rise even further across 2025. price hikes and job losses could have a total global economic toll of 1.4 trillion 1.1 trillion under the worst-case scenario according to aston business school. that is if full global retaliation with reciprocal tariffs is the eventual outcome, which would see the us economy in particular hit. naturally, if the entire planet is affected to that scale, the uk wouldnt be exempt, but theres still scope for changing trade paths, perhaps seeking out partners to increase back-and-forth business with if a reliance on the us is no longer plausible. quite aside from the businesses involved, government spending could also be impacted. last week, rachel reeves noted the government was laying out savings to restore 9.9bn of headroom for government expenditure. one assessment of a worst-case scenario involving trump tariffs and the uk suggests that would be entirely and immediately wiped out. david miles, from the office for budget responsibilitys obr budget responsibility committee, told mps if tariffs at 20 25 per cent were put on the uk and maintained for five years, our assessment of what that does is that it will knock out all the headroom that the government currently has. had we made that a central forecast, and had the government not changed policy at all knowing that we were going to take that as our central forecast, then the headroom would have pretty much all gone. mr miles noted the improbability of the extreme scenario, which would include a term beyond the next us presidential elections, but the obr further noted the hit to business confidence across the uk caused by the uncertainty around tariffs and other costs. at the other end of the scale, theres the perspective that some changes could in fact mean the uk might actually benefit from a trade war. again, its important to note thats on a broad, all-encompassing term there would still be businesses or industries negatively affected within that. but the obr noted that if the uk avoided involvement in a trade war, reciprocal tariffs and the like, some redirected trade flows could end up increasing business this side of the water. much of that is based around the fact that the uk-us trade deficit is far more reasonably balanced than, for example, the eu-us one. professor irina surdu-nardella, of warwick business school, told cnbc tariffs could yet have a limited impact on the uk. effects would be relatively limited to industries such as fishing and mining, ms surdu-nardella said, pointing to the service-focused nature of the uk economy meaning much of it would be unscathed by import tariffs. of course, theres also the possibility that mr trump and mr starmer find an agreement whereby british companies end up entirely unaffected by the whole process, potentially giving them a foothold to gain further business with overseas customers. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see

  Title: US committed as ever to Nato and Trump is not against the alliance, says Rubio
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-03 15:25:55)
  Content: washington wants to see european countries increase defence spending to five per cent, the us secretary of state said from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. the us is as committed to nato as ever, secretary of state marco rubio said, hours after the alliances countries were left reeling by donald trumps watershed tariff announcement. mr rubio touched down in brussels earlier on thursday before natos foreign ministers convened to discuss global security and ongoing efforts to reach peace in ukraine. but the 53-year-old met with his counterparts amid the backdrop of rising tensions between washington and its allies within the alliance, elevated after the us presidents bombshell tariff speech on wednesday. the trump administration had already raised significant doubts about natos future, questioning the efficacy of the 75-year-old alliance and how far americas membership was in the us national interest. dismissing doubts about washingtons commitment to nato as hysteria, mr rubio told reporters during a press conference with secretary-general mark rutte the united states is in nato. the united states is as active in nato as it has ever been. the us president is not against nato, mr rubio said, rather he is against a nato that does not have the capabilities that it needs to fulfill the obligations that the treaty imposes upon each and every member state. he then called on european countries to develop a pathway to bring their defence spending to five per cent of gdp, a move which mr trump has previously called for and a vast increase on the current 2 per cent goal. addressing european concerns about the timeframe and extent to which the us was considering reducing reducing its nato engagement, mr rubio said we do want to leave here with an understanding that we are on a pathway, a realistic pathway, to every single one of the members committing and fulfilling a promise to reach up to five per cent of spending. this included the us, he said, adding no one expects that youre going to be able to do this in one year or two. but the pathway has to be real. washington expects european ministers to use this weeks meeting to demonstrate their plans to boost defence spending, with just 23 of natos 32 members meeting the current 2 per cent target last year. but ukraine will also likely be a key topic in the discussions, as europe looks to gain more influence over the talks - which have been heavily led by the us so far. kirill dmitriev, one of vladimir putins most trusted international envoys, is currently in washington for the first official visit of a russian since the full-scale invasion of ukraine in 2022. the us-educated, former goldman sachs investment banker, who was invited by us middle east envoy steve witkoff, has a strong relationship with many us officials including key members of the trump team - but details of the talks have so far been kept under wraps. finlands president alexander stubb said on thursday that at least one country from the so-called coalition of the willing - the group of countries willing to engage in peacekeeping efforts in ukraine - should speak directly with russia. my personal preference would be that our representatives of the coalition of the willing would be doing that. in other words france or the united kingdom, he said. mr stubb proposed france or the uk as the best candidates to do so. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Trump tariffs: When will they be announced - and how will the UK be affected?
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-02 06:54:10)
  Content: some of uks key industries could be hit when us president announces sweeping measures today from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for

americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. donald trumps trade war will expand across the globe today as his administration prepares to impose a wide set of tariffs on goods imported to the us from overseas. dubbed liberation day by the us president, it seems likely all nations will be included in the sweeping measures the uk included. this is despite attempts by ministers to secure an exclusive carve-out with the trump administration, something sir keir starmer has admitted has not been agreed upon. the prime minister said the likelihood is there will be tariffs. nobody welcomes that. we are obviously working with the sectors most impacted at pace on that. nobody wants to see a trade war but i have to act in the national interests, he told sky news. sir keir added that all options remain on the table, but has not followed other nations in announcing retaliatory tariffs on the the us. the european union eu has already retaliated to the first round of tariffs by imposing its own on 26 billion euros 22 billion worth of goods from the us. the bloc says it will deliver a timely, robust and calibrated response to the upcoming announcement. the full extent of the tariffs has not been revealed by the trump administration, but his team have given a clear indication what to expect. the measures will add to the 25 per cent tariff placed on imports of steel and aluminium to the us on all countries since march. new global tariffs targeting auto parts used to make cars have now been confirmed after trump delayed imposing 25 per cent on these goods from its neighbouring nations and china until the start of april. hundreds of reciprocal tariffs are also understood to have been drawn up by the trump administration, which will be different for every country. these will consider factors like existing tariffs, trade balances and vat for all of the uss trading partners. due to be announced at 9pm bst 4pm local time in a press conference at the white house rose garden, heres what president trumps tariff plans could mean for the uk the 25 per cent tariff on steel and aluminium imports to the us has been in place since the middle of march. in such a short time its hard to measure the long-term impact of the decision on the uk. however, economists say it could affect uk products worth hundreds of millions of pounds as things like cars, cans and tin foil are likely to become more expensive. the uks steel industry is already struggling as excess capacity in the global market has pushed prices down. this large-scale production is largely coming from china, which is what is partly motivating trump to place even higher tariffs on the countrys steel at a massive 45 per cent. industry figures in the uk have publicly disagreed with the labours decision to not retaliate. gareth stace, the director-general of trade association uk steel, branded the trump administrations move hugely disappointing, and urged the government to take decisive action to protect the industry. these tariffs couldnt come at a worse time for the uk steel industry, as we battle with high energy costs and subdued demand at home, against an oversupplied and increasingly protectionist global landscape, he said. the us is the steel industrys second largest export market behind the european union. president trump has confirmed that a 25 per cent import tax will be introduced on all cars imported to the us, a measure which will be a blow to the uks automotive industry. some 16.9 per cent of uk car exports were to the us last year, representing a total of more than 101,000 units worth 7.6 billion. russ mould, investment director at aj bell, said the tariffs come at a very difficult time for the industry as uk car production dropped 12 per cent in february compared to the year before. he said consumer confidence is on edge, we know its a highly competitive market, and even electric vehicles arent perhaps quite selling as quickly as hoped. british brand jaguar land rover is set to be particularly hit by the tariffs, as 100 per cent of its cars sold in the us are made abroad. its famous defender and range rover lines are popular in the us, making the nation its top sales destination worldwide. the new tariffs will come as a major blow to labour as it looks to grow the economy, with business secretary jonathan reynolds saying it is his objective to have the tariffs reversed. i cant give a timescale on that but, of course, the longer we dont have a potential resolution to that, the more we will have to consider our own position in relation to that, mr reynolds said in a reference to potential retaliatory tariffs. focusing on what is has called unfairness in the uss international trade agreements, the trump administration has also promised to impose reciprocal tariffs which will be set at different rates for every partner. initially thought to only comprise the countrys largest 10 to 15 trading partners, trump told reporters at the end of march that this was a rumour and that all countries would see tariffs placed on them. his comments caused economic uncertainty, with the us stock market seeing its lowest month since december 2022. how the trump administration works out how to apply these tariffs in the uk remains to be seen. the uk says it is in a trade surplus with the us, meaning that exports are bigger than imports. meanwhile, the us says the trade surplus is reversed. the discrepancy is largely due to different methods of measuring services trade. while the us is the uks largest single trading partner, the nation exports for more goods to the european union as a whole. in the 12 months to november, the uk exported 57 billion to the us and 175 billion to the eu. however, the trump administration says its plans will counter trading partners that impose unfair, discriminatory, or extraterritorial taxes on the us including a value-added tax vat. in the uk, vat stands at 20 per cent and is charged on most goods and services sold domestically. meanwhile, the us does not have a single nationwide vat rate, instead varying by state and ranging from five to 10 per cent. for this reason, some economists have speculated that the us may seek to impose a reciprocal 20 per cent tariff on the uk which rebalances the final cost of goods sold in the uk and us. vat in the uk is charged at a customer level, meaning it generally is not considered to have an impact on international trade prices. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

This action demonstrates a state (US) prioritizing its own economic interests and security (boosting home-grown production) even if it negatively impacts other states (UK, China) and the global economy. This aligns with Realism's emphasis on states as self-interested actors in an anarchic international system. This could lead to a cycle of retaliatory actions and increased global instability.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that "tariff measures have largely targeted goods, leaving much of the services sector comparatively insulated." This is noteworthy because it suggests a potential strategic calculation behind the tariff policy. What are the specific reasons for targeting goods over services, and who benefits most from this selective application of tariffs? Could this be a deliberate attempt to protect certain domestic industries while putting pressure on others?

  Title: Bank of England rate-setter says US tariffs likely to push down on inflation
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 11:13:59)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article touches upon aspects of Realism in international relations, specifically concerning trade and tariffs. The US imposing tariffs on the UK, as mentioned in the text ('the us has imposed a 10 import tariff on goods coming from the uk, a policy which also applies to many other countries'), exemplifies a state acting in its perceived self-interest to protect its economy, regardless of the impact on other nations. This action, and the UK's subsequent economic considerations, reflect the competitive and often conflictual nature of international trade relations as described by Realist theory.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents Megan Greene's analysis of potential disinflationary effects of US tariffs on the UK, but also acknowledges 'a tonne of uncertainty around this.' This uncertainty, coupled with the mention of 'both inflationary and disinflationary forces,' suggests a more complex and potentially volatile economic situation than a simple cause-and-effect narrative. What specific factors contribute most to this uncertainty, and how might they interact to produce unexpected economic outcomes?; Intriguing_angles: The opening section discusses the importance of 'parsing out the facts from the messaging' in the context of US politics, while the latter part focuses on economic analysis of UK inflation. This juxtaposition, while seemingly unrelated, could subtly imply that economic narratives are also subject to manipulation or biased framing. To what extent might political messaging influence the interpretation and presentation of economic data, and what mechanisms might facilitate such influence?

journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. britain must prepare for the worst from new import tariffs, the foreign secretary david lammy said yesterday as the world awaits the start of donald trumps trade war. the united states president has threatened to impose fees of 20 per cent or more on imports from around the world with immediate effect in measures expected to be announced on wednesday which he has dubbed liberation day. global market jitters continued over the potential impact of a trade war, as one study estimated it could cost the world 1.1 trillion. in britain alone, 25,000 jobs are at risk according to the institute of public policy research ippr, which said the new white house trade policy would completely destabilise the uk car manufacturing industry. meanwhile, goldman sachs analysts expected britains gdp to suffer a greater hit than previously feared even if a uk trade deal were agreed, due to larger negative spillovers from tariffs levied against the european union. as a result, the bank now expects 0.8 per cent of uk growth this year and 1.2 per cent in 2026 down from 0.9 and 1.3 respectively. chancellor rachel reeves told a cabinet meeting that there would be a serious impact from the tariffs. and while business secretary jonathan reynolds tried to be optimistic about the prospect of a uk-us deal, he was unable to give a timeline on when one might be completed. ministers were also forced to deny the trump administration was making demands about free speech in the uk as part of any potential trade deal. mr trump has previously announced a 25 per cent tax will be introduced on all cars imported to the us. he has also announced similar tariffs on steel and aluminium. however, the announcement on wednesday is expected to be far more wide-ranging. as the world braces for the impact, ireland warned it could lose up to 80,000 jobs under a worst-case scenario. in the house of commons, mr lammy said intense conversations were still taking place on a possible economic agreement. liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesperson calum miller asked if britain should enter talks with the eu on a customs union to soften the blow of tariffs. mr lammy replied its hugely important at this time that we continue the intense conversations were having with the us administration on getting an economic agreement but of course we prepare for the worst all options remain on the table, as the prime minister indicated. earlier, tory leader kemi badenoch had admitted she has not tried to use her relationship with senior white house figures, such as vice-president jd vance, to avoid tariffs. researchers at the ippr warned that employees at jaguar land rover and mini are some of the most exposed to a potential trade war. some 16.9 per cent of uk car exports were to the us last year, representing a total of more than 101,000 units worth 7.6bn. ippr research fellow pranesh narayanan said trumps tariffs have huge potential to completely destabilise the uk car manufacturing industry, affecting tens of thousands of jobs and putting the governments growth plans in jeopardy. meanwhile, a new study from the aston business school in birmingham estimates a global trade war could cost 1.4 trillion 1.1 trillion. the research maps six escalating scenarios, starting with us tariffs on canada, mexico and china, through to full global retaliation, with associated wider losses. earlier, sir keir starmer told sky news the likelihood is there will be tariffs. nobody welcomes that. we are obviously working with the sectors most impacted at pace on that. nobody wants to see a trade war but i have to act in the national interests. he said he hoped the deal being negotiated with the us would mitigate the tariffs. asked if he had been played by mr trump amid his efforts to build a good relationship, the prime minister said the us is our closest ally. our defence, our security, our intelligence are bound up in a way that no two other countries are. so its obviously in our national interest to have a close working relationship with the us, which weve had for decades, and i want to ensure we have for decades to come. he said talks on an economic deal would normally take months or years but in a matter of weeks we have got well advanced in those discussions. the pm is willing to offer us big tech firms a large tax cut in a bid to avoid tariffs, according to the guardian. the uk government is said to be considering reducing the headline rate of its digital services tax dst and to broaden its scope to include companies from other countries, a move which would represent a significant concession to us tech firms. the tax currently imposes a 2 per cent levy on tech firms, including us giants such as amazon, meta, alphabet, ebay and apple and generates about 800m a year. if it is lowered and applied to other countries it could satisfy mr trump, who has complained about the impact that dsts are having on us firms. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Tariffs live: Trump unveils 10% reciprocal tariff on imports from UK and 20% on EU in global trade shake-up
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-02 22:38:20)
  Content: donald trump has announced a reciprocal tariff of 10 on britain from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to

reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. donald trump slapped a 10 per cent tariff on us imports of uk goods as he set out sweeping trade levies hitting countries across the world. the us president said his liberation day announcement was a declaration of economic independence. mr trump confirmed that from 5am on thursday a 25 per cent tariff would be imposed on all foreign cars imported to the us a move which experts fear could cost 25,000 jobs in the british car industry. and he indicated tariffs of 10 per cent would apply to other products from the uk the same level as the global baseline he was setting for countries around the world. other blocs with higher tariffs on us goods were hit with tougher import taxes, including 20 per cent for the european union. sir keir starmers government hopes to strike an economic deal with the white house which will mitigate the impacts. but chancellor rachel reeves acknowledged the uk would not be out of the woods even if a deal could be reached. mr trump predicted foreign presidents, prime ministers, kings, queens, ambassadors and everyone else would soon be calling him to ask for exemptions from the tariffs. italian prime minister giorgia meloni said mr trumps new tariffs were wrong, and that she hoped to work with the us and europe to avoid a trade war that would weaken the west. the prime ministers office hinted at relief that the announcement wasnt worse. a downing street source said we dont want any tariffs at all, but a lower levy than others vindicates our approach. it matters because the difference between 10 and 20 is thousands of jobs. we will keep negotiating, keep cool and keep calm. we want to negotiate a sustainable trade deal, and of course to get tariffs lowered. tomorrow we will continue with that work. no immediate retaliatory measures are expected from the government as it focuses on trying to strike the hoped-for economic deal with the us. but experts say more than 25,000 uk car manufacturing jobs could be at risk from the 25 tariff on cars. there is no justification for us tariffs that will hit ireland, irish premier micheal martin said. the taoiseach said ireland believes in open and free trade and that the imposition of tariffs is bad for the world economy. i deeply regret the us decision to impose 20 tariffs on imports from across the european union. we see no justification for this. mr martin said now is a time for dialogue, and i believe that a negotiated way forward is the only sensible one. a confrontation is in no ones interests. uk steel has called for a significant intervention to help the industry out of a crisis. director general gareth stace said three weeks ago, president trump delivered a cataclysmic strike to uk steel exports for us manufacturers. the new 10 tariffs, stacked on top of the existing 25 levies, are not only sticking the knife in again, but this time turning it in the wound for maximum effect. the uk government must continue its efforts to strike a deal with the us, but we recognise that this requires willingness from both sides. we cannot afford to wait any longer as our exports are being damaged, and our market is being undercut by rising imports. uk steel has warned that the steel crisis has been deepening for some time and bold, decisive and significant interventions are needed now. shadow trade secretary andrew griffith has described the tariff announcement as disappointing news and suggested that brexit spared the uk from higher import taxes. he called on the government to agree a fair deal with the us for the benefit of businesses and consumers, saying this is disappointing news which will worry working families across the country. the chancellors emergency budget of just a week ago with its inadequate headroom is now at risk, casting uncertainty about more taxes or spending cuts. sadly, it is british businesses and workers who will pay the price for labours failure. he added the silver lining is that brexit, which labour ministers voted against no less than 48 times, means that we face far lower tariffs than the eu a brexit dividend that will have protected thousands of british jobs and businesses. the prime minister will face some brickbats for failing to win a carve out from tariffs with what many see as a fawning approach to donald trump and his rightwing white house administration. but as the world digests the stunning news of reciprocal tariffs unleashed around the globe, sir keir starmer can take some satisfaction from his work and have hope that for the uk at least there is a quick resolution to this nightmare. as downing street was quick to point out, the 10 per cent minimum tariff being imposed on the uk is much better than others, most notably the eu. this literally is the difference between saving and losing many thousands of jobs. there have been positive noises from downing street that despite issues around free speech concerns from the us, the uk and america are close to a trade deal which would even see these tariffs go away. there is though a very much wait and see on that. so while starmer and his ministers can take some satisfaction now from their efforts there is still a lot of work ahead and high stakes. these tariffs wipe out the chancellor rachel reeves economic headroom. a failure to get rid of them will leave the uk government in a lot of trouble. the society of motor manufacturers and traders branded the new tariffs deeply disappointing. mike hawes, chief executive, said the announced imposition of a 10 tariff on all uk products exported to the us, whilst less than other major economies, is another deeply disappointing and potentially damaging measure. our cars were already set to attract a punitive 25 tariff overnight and other automotive products are now set to be impacted immediately. while we hope a deal between the uk and us can still be negotiated, this is yet another challenge to a sector already facing multiple headwinds. these tariff costs cannot be absorbed by manufacturers, thus hitting us consumers who may face additional costs and a reduced choice of iconic british brands, whilst uk producers may have to review output in the face of constrained demand. trade discussions must continue at pace, therefore, and we urge all parties to continue to negotiate and deliver solutions which support jobs, consumer demand and economic growth across both sides of the atlantic. business secretary jonathan reynolds said the united states was our closest ally and the government would remain calm and committed to doing a deal to mitigate the impact of the tariffs announced by donald trump. uk manufacturing body make uk reportedly says the 10 tariffs will be devastating for british exporters. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Global growth forecasts slashed in fallout from tariffs, IMF warns
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 14:39:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Economic Protectionism theory, the article details how the US imposition of tariffs ('us president donald trump unveiled a range of new and higher tariffs') is presented as a direct cause ('leading to global trade disruption', 'forced to change its projections') for predicted negative economic outcomes globally ('significantly slow growth', 'slashing its global growth forecast', 'sharp increase... will lead to a significant slowdown'). This aligns with protectionism's predicted consequences of disrupting trade flows and potentially harming overall global economic efficiency, as highlighted by the IMF's warnings.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article's structure, beginning with the IMF's report and its specific findings on growth forecasts and tariff impacts, suggests an application of Agenda-Setting Theory. The IMF, as a prominent international organization ('the international monetary fund imf has warned'), is positioned as the authoritative source defining the key economic problems (slowed growth, uncertainty, trade war risk) and their primary cause (US tariffs), thereby shaping the public discourse and political reactions presented later in the text.

global trade disruption and unprecedented uncertainty is set to significantly slow growth in economies around the world, the international monetary fund imf has warned. the organisation said it is slashing its global growth forecast by 0.5 percentage points this year, with nearly all countries seeing a downgrade. the latest world economic outlook report was produced under exceptional circumstances, with the imf being forced to change its projections after us president donald trump unveiled a range of new and higher tariffs earlier this month. the imfs top economist, pierre-olivier gourinchas, said we are entering a new era as the global system that has operated for the last 80 years is being reset. he added while many of the scheduled tariff increases are on hold for now, the combination of measures and countermeasures has hiked us and global tariff rates to centennial highs. for this reason, we expect that the sharp increase on april 2 in both tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a significant slowdown in global growth in the near term. global growth is projected to fall from 3.3 in 2024 to 2.8 in 2025, before edging up to 3 in 2026. this is lower than the imfs previous forecasts, published in january, by 0.5 percentage points for 2025 and 0.3 percentage points for 2026. the outlook for nearly all countries has been downgraded, reflecting the direct effect of new trade measures and the knock-on impact on uncertainty, which has surged to unprecedented levels, and deteriorating sentiment among consumers and businesses. the uk economy is predicted to grow by 1.1 this year, 0.5 percentage points less than januarys forecast, partly reflecting tariffs, as well as weaker consumption amid higher inflation driven by bills and energy price hikes. growth will nonetheless be stronger in the uk than germany which is predicted to flatline this year france, and italy. meanwhile, inflation forecasts have been revised upwards for advanced economies since january, with the uk and the us being hit hardest. uk inflation is set to be 0.7 percentage points higher this year, compared with the previous forecast, at 3.1 largely due to prices like water and electricity rising from april. this is higher than all other countries in the group of seven advanced economies g7, which incorporates germany, france, italy, japan, canada, and the us. chancellor rachel reeves said the new forecasts show the uk is still the fastest-growing european country in the g7. the imf have recognised that this government is delivering reform which will drive up long-term growth in the uk, through our plan for change, she said. the report also clearly shows that the world has changed, which is why i will be in washington this week defending british interests and making the case for free and fair trade. shadow chancellor mel stride said at a time when families are looking for stability and support, labours policies are stifling growth, pushing up the cost of living and leaving us vulnerable to external shocks. global trade growth projections have been slashed by 1.5 percentage points since the previous world economic outlook. the imf warned over the increased risk of a trade war, which would particularly hit china and the us but also many countries in asia and europe. the organisation stopped short of forecasting a recession in the us, but slashed its growth forecast for the worlds biggest economy to 1.8, down by 0.9 percentage points since its last prediction. it added that the risk of a recession in the us had increased sharply from about a 25 probability to around 40. china is predicted to grow by 4 this year, down from the imfs previous forecast of 4.6. the imf also stressed that central bank independence was important in the fight against rising inflation amid concerns over mr trumps renewed attack on us federal reserve chairman jerome powell, branding him a major loser for not cutting rates. mr gourinchas said at an imf press briefing the critical thing is to make sure that inflation expectations remain anchored and that central banks do whats necessary to bring inflation back to targets. central banks need to remain credible and part of that is built upon their central bank independence. from that perspective, its very important to preserve that. the imf report also showed that heightened uncertainty around trade policy has also weakened the overall outlook, with many global firms likely to react to tariffs by suspending or reducing investments and cutting spending. banks may also slow lending to businesses while they assess how exposed borrowers will be to the new trade environment. the global economy is being severely tested with the risk that trade retaliation may ratchet up tensions, while financial markets could continue to react sharply to lower growth prospects, according to the imf. however, the imf said there is also the opportunity for more positive consequences depending on how countries work together and address the new challenges. if countries de-escalate from their current tariff stance, and co-ordinate to deliver clarity and stability on trade policy, the outlook could immediately brighten, mr gourinchas said.

  Title: Spain to reach NATO's spending goal of 2% of GDP on defense this year
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 13:02:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: Spain's increased defense spending, driven by pressure from NATO and the US, reflects a realist perspective where states prioritize their security in response to a perceived changing international environment. The quote, 'facing what he called a changing era, sánchez said it was it was time for spain to take control of our own destiny and contribute to europes rearmament,' demonstrates this focus on self-reliance and power balancing.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Sánchez's plan to bypass parliament for defense spending. This omission raises questions about the stability of his minority government and the potential for internal conflict within the ruling coalition. What compromises might Sánchez have made to appease his coalition partners, and how might this affect the long-term implementation of the defense spending plan?

even the imf themselves underline the fact that everything could still change significantly - after all, these sweeping cuts in growth expectations are to projections only made back in january. imf chief economist pierre-oliver gourinchas noted that many possible paths exist, reflecting the unpredictability surrounding future trade policy and the varied impact of tariffs across different countries. in interest rate terms, watching uk inflation will be a good indicator of what the boe will do next, but former deputy governor and chief economist of the office for budget responsibility obr charlie bean has already called for greater action to be taken through bigger rates cuts. two further interest rate cuts are still predicted by many analysts after may. lower rates could also make it easier for first-time buyers to get on the property ladder, would lower government borrowing costs and ease pressures on uk businesses after hiked labour costs this year - but the boes primary focus appears to be on not letting inflation run riot again as it did in such costly fashion two years ago.

  Title: A frosty welcome awaits Rubio in Europe

  Content: some nato diplomats privately question whether their placating strategy towards trump will be enough to fully avert an acrimonious june summit. analysis based on factual reporting, although it incorporates the expertise of the authorproducer and may offer interpretations and conclusions. us secretary of state marco rubio arrives to meet with german foreign minister annalena baerbock at the 61st munich security conference on february 15, 2025 in munich, germany. sean gallupgetty images based on factual reporting, although it incorporates the expertise of the authorproducer and may offer interpretations and conclusions. print email reddit facebook linkedin whatsapp telegram brussels nato foreign ministers are set to meet in brussels on thursday to lay the groundwork for saving the alliances hague summit in june from americas unfolding disaster. rubios in-person encounter with european allies comes only hours after the us slapped sweeping tariffs on europe, kicking off a trade war, and merely a week after the signal chat scandal, where text message exchanges on us strikes on yemen laid bare the trump administrations deep disdain of what they call european freeloading. americas european allies still remember us defense secretary pete hegseth throwing a february meeting into disarray by first announcing a us security shift and removing red lines on ukraine. rubio is expected to be a tiny bit more gentle than that when he touches down in brussels but will be pressed to explain washingtons current course as his counterparts plan to use the talks to lay the groundwork for natos hague summit in june. nato diplomats still see rubio as one of the few remaining republican trans-atlanticists who have been more pragmatic about the value of the western military alliance and security cooperation with europe. but they will be forced to walk a fine line between rebuke and appeasement. a worst-case scenario cited in brussels is us president donald trump attempting to use natos hague summit as a means to force allies into concessions on ukraine, such as a partial lifting of sanctions as part of a us-russia peace deal or anything else, really. there is unspoken agreement that the most effective pressure point trump could use is a drawdown of the around 100,000 american troops stationed in europe. the best guesses by european allies circulating around nato hq involve the roughly 20,000 troops sent by the biden administration to the continent after russia launched its full-scale invasion. european nato allies have already ramped up their efforts, pushed by nato secretary-general mark rutte, who wants every single one of them to commit at least 3.5 gdp as soon as possible. a number of european nato allies, including germany, the uk and others, have made a number of very significant announcements on defence spending over the past weeks. very few are likely to meet trumps call to raise defence expenditure to 5 of gdp, which not even washington currently meets. even with looser eu spending rules, several countriesincluding france, spain, and italywill struggle to satisfy trumps demands quickly. some nato diplomats privately question whether the placating strategy will be enough to fully avert an acrimonious alliance summit with trump in late june. one could read the signal messages in a way that it should have become pretty clear now that this is not only about spending anymore, one european diplomat said, indicating that rubio might face questions to explain comments made. trumps desire to annex greenland is expected to come up when rubio meets bilaterally with danish counterpart lars løkke rasmussen. rubio also will come face-to-face with the eus top diplomat, kaja kallas, whom he snubbed last month during a visit to washington, citing scheduling issues. at present, they are not expected to meet bilaterally in brussels either, an eu official said. rubio will also face questions from allies and ukraines foreign minister andriy sybiha on trumps recent u-turns on kyivs future nato membership, which the alliance last year said was an irreversible path, and a watered-down g7 declaration on russias war in ukraine. nato boss rutte, meanwhile, has been facing an increasingly uncomfortable balancing act, too. by trying to play the honest broker between trump and european allies, he has earned criticism among some nato members for being too soft on washington. yes, europe needs to know that uncle sam still has our back, but america also needs to know that its nato allies will step up and play their full part, without restrictions and without capability gaps, rutte said in warsaw last week. reassurance is a two-way street, he added. print email reddit facebook linkedin whatsapp telegram le pen appeal what happens next?

not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. british firms have been hit by a 10 per cent tariff on all exports to the united states as donald trump ushered in a new era for global trade and pledged america will no longer be ripped off. the us president said his liberation day announcement in which some nations will pay as much as 34 per cent was a declaration of economic independence. it means that sir keir starmers government has failed to secure a carve-out for britain from tariffs, but while the uk was 13th on a naughty list of nations brandished at a white house press conference, it had the joint lowest tariffs along with nations such as brazil. european union nations face 20 per cent penalties while china will pay 34 per cent and cambodia an eye-watering 49 per cent. switzerland was also hit hard with 31 per cent. taiwan, which is struggling for survival against threats from china, faces 32 per cent and india is getting 26 per cent. a downing street source said we dont want any tariffs at all, but a lower levy than others vindicates our approach. it matters because the difference between 10 per cent and 20 per cent is thousands of jobs. we will keep negotiating, keep cool and keep calm. we want to negotiate a sustainable trade deal, and of course to get tariffs lowered. tomorrow we will continue with that work. after days of build up the us president waited for markets to close to make his big announcement in the rose garden of the white house on what he has dubbed liberation day. he was surrounded by his cabinet, members of the congress, senators, automobile workers and farmers as he promised to make america wealthy again. he said april 2nd 2025 will forever be remembered as the day american industry was reborn. americas destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make america wealthy again. for decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike. americans really suffered gravely. they watched in anguish as foreign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories and foreign scavengers that have torn apart our once beautiful american dream. our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not going to happen anymore. at one point the president introduced an automobile worker onto the stage to talk about how car plants in the state of michigan had been forced to close because of foreign competition. the president listed a series of grievances noting that tariffs on cars in south korea and japan prevented the us from entering the market. he complained of 20 per cent vat taxes on sales in the eu which also applied to britain. and he claimed dairy products to canada were getting hit by tariffs of more than 200 per cent. while the uk got little mention, apart from a reference on his list, it is still getting the base level of 10 per cent tariffs, although that is half the level it would have had if it was still in the eu. ministers knew it would be impossible to avoid the measures after mr trump made it clear that he was imposing tariffs on cars. around 17 per cent of uk cars go to the us market and already the institute of public policy research ippr has estimated it will cost britain 25,000 jobs in the automobile sector. mr trump has claimed his new tariff regime will rebalance trade with the us and stop countries taking advantage of his country. he had already announced that he would impose 25 per cent tariffs on all automobiles, steel and aluminium imports to america which included the uk. business secretary jonathan reynolds made it clear there would be no knee jerk response. he said we have a range of tools at our disposal and we will not hesitate to act. we will continue to engage with uk businesses including on their assessment of the impact of any further steps we take. nobody wants a trade war and our intention remains to secure a deal. but nothing is off the table and the government will do everything necessary to defend the uks national interest. earlier the prime minister resisted calls for him to turn his back on america and concentrate on rebuilding relationships with the eu as the main trading partner. during pmqs liberal democrat leader sir ed davey urged the prime minister to join other nations in an economic coalition of the willing to respond to the us tariffs. but sir keir described sir eds proposal as a false choice and insisted that he would not abandon hopes of a trade deal with the us. he told mps a trade war is in nobodys interests and the country deserves and we will take a calm, pragmatic approach. tina mckenzie, policy chair of the federation of small businesses, said tariffs will cause untold damage to small businesses trying to trade their way into profit while the domestic economy remains flat. conservative shadow trade secretary, andrew griffith, said labour failed to negotiate with president trumps team for too many months after the election, failed to keep our experienced top trade negotiator, and failed to get a deal to avoid the imposition of these tariffs by our closest trading partner. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see

  Title: Trump announces huge new tariffs to promote US manufacturing, risking inflation and trade wars
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 20:57:51)
  Content: by josh boak associated press washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the new tariffs, coming on what trump has named liberation day, are a bid to boost u.s. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he says are years of unfair trade practices. but by most economists assessments, the move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and upend decades-old alliances. the white house is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble. april 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern american history, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said tuesday. she said the new tariffs would take effect immediately. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. based on the possibility of broad 20 tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. because trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. leavitt is among three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the associated press on first and fifth amendment grounds. the ap says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. the white house says the ap is not following an executive order to refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america. associated press writers mike householder in oldcastle, ontario, sylvie corbet in paris and lisa mascaro contributed to this report.

  Title: Britain, singed by Trump’s tariffs, races for U.S. trade deal

  Content: london if the shock wave of the trump administrations worldwide tariffs was also the start of a race to reach trade deals with the united states, british prime minister keir starmer thinks he can win. officials here believe a trade accord with president donald trump to remove or reduce the 10 percent tariffs he imposed on britain on wednesday is already within reach, possibly within weeks. and starmer, ignoring accusations of kowtowing to trump from some critics, is ready to make major concessions to reach a deal even as other countries rush to the trade war barricades with reprisal tariffs, boycotts and outrage. the british have already offered to cut tariffs on imported american beef and fish, according to two people familiar with negotiations between london and washington, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the discussions. and starmers government is ready to put an even bigger prize on the table lowering british taxes paid by big american tech companies. the british hope those concessions have put them in pole position among dozens of countries now scrambling to cut new deals with washington. every country is calling us, trump told reporters aboard air force one thursday. now they will do anything for us. the presidents son eric trump said governments were right to be in a hurry. i wouldnt want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal, he wrote on x thursday. the first to negotiate will win the last will absolutely lose. political analysts said trumps launch of across-the-board tariffs during a rose garden rally was meant to both impress his voters and stun trade ministers around the world. the view in the u.k. is that trump wanted to a make big show thursday that was really a scene for his base, said mujtaba rahman, a managing director at the eurasia group, a political risk consulting firm. but now the negotiations are expected to get serious. the question is, how quickly do things move now? rahman said. british negotiators had hoped to reach a deal even before trump announced across-the-board tariff hikes wednesday. but britain ended up on the list with almost every country, though at half the 20 percent rate trump slapped on the european union and well below the 34 percent imposed on china. british officials credit starmers careful management of trump for the relatively easy treatment an ongoing campaign of charm and restraint as well as a royal invitation for the president to pay a second state visit to the united kingdom. the low-key strategy continued this week. starmer said his government would react to the tariff hike which even at 10 percent threatens to derail his economic recovery plans with cool heads. the closest thing to a tit-for-tit reprisal whitehall announced was a month-long consultation with u.k. businesses over the implications of possible british retaliatory tariffs. that tone sets britain well apart from governments threatening to, or rolling out, immediate countermeasures. china on friday matched trump with a 34 percent levy on incoming u.s. goods and other punitive steps. canada said it would impose a 25 percent duty on some u.s.-made cars, and european union officials said they were preparing a range of phased reprisal measures. in europe, those tough responses reflect the anger that governments, and their voters, feel at washingtons quick turn from longtime free trade ally to hard-nosed competitor. some european grocery stores are marking u.s. products with stars to help annoyed consumers avoid them. french president emmanuel macron, calling for countries to stand together against trump, asked businesses thursday to put new u.s. investments on hold. what would be the message of having major european players start investing billions of euros in the american economy at a time when they are in the process of beating us up? he said. we need collective solidarity. starmer is under pressure from critics to band with its more bellicose neighbors. in a speech to parliament, ed davey, the head of britains liberal democrat party, called on starmer to join an economic coalition of the willing against trump. davey, in an interview with britains channel four news, said it was unthinkable to trim tax rates for american tech giants, which would benefit x and tesla owner elon musk and other tech billionaires, at the same time that britain is cutting social services. lets put tariffs on teslas, he said. lets look at the tech bros. starmer has so far steadfastly resisted calls to take a harder line. his bet on a softer approach could pay off. during starmers white house visit in february, trump signaled interest in closing a bilateral deal with london very quickly. leslie vinjamuri, head of the u.s. and americas program at chatham house, said britain has so far managed to leverage its key advantages it is no longer part of the e.u., a particular trump target it does not run a major trade deficit with the united states and it has an uniquely long history of bilateral cooperation with washington, referred to on both sides of the atlantic as the special relationship. starmer quickly fell in line with trumps demands that european countries spend more on their defense, pledging to hike overall defense spending to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product within two years. and the prime minister has managed one oval office visit and numerous trump phone calls since without provoking the presidents anger, even while doubling down on support for ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky, who has been a subject of trumps derision. additionally, london entrusted the trade talks to some of its most seasoned washington hands, vinjamuri noted. british pragmatism is so far proving to be a pretty good strategy, he said. i think they are in very good position. of course, its with an administration where a good position can turn into a bad position very quickly. a trade war with the u.s., the u.k.s largest trading partner, could hamstring starmers campaign to lift britains moribund economy. but by racing to reach a bilateral deal with trump, starmer risks widening a post-brexit gap with europe that he has been trying to narrow since taking office last year. starmers approach on trade puts him at odds with europe, which will retaliate against the u.s. and probably by mid-april, said rahman. the prime minister will try to balance europes annoyance at a quick british trade deal with what london has to offer the continent in terms of security and defense, rahman said. european leaders are scrambling to bolster their own militaries in light of trumps pivot toward russia and hints that washington could scale back its role in nato. even as he worked to finesse washington, starmer has emerged as a champion of european priorities pledging british troops as part of any future peace monitoring force in ukraine while leading a drive to recruit other countries to contribute to the effort. starmer will likely double down on londons role within a newly unifying europe, in penance for avoiding trumps trade wrath, rahman said.

  Title: Trump announces sweeping new tariffs, baseline tax on imports - Syracuse.com
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-02 21:01:00)
  Content: president donald trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the rose garden at the white house, wednesday, april 2, 2025, in washington. ap photomark schiefelbeinap washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the tariffs follow similar recent announcements of 25 taxes on auto imports levies against china, canada and mexico and expanded trade penalties on steel and aluminum. trump has also imposed tariffs on countries that import oil from venezuela and he plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose have caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy, despite the risk of political backlash as voters in last years election said they wanted trump to combat inflation. senior administration officials, who insisted on anonymity to preview the new tariffs with reporters ahead of trumps speech, said the taxes would raise hundreds of billions of dollars annually in revenues. they said the 10 baseline rate existed to help ensure compliance, while the higher rates were based on the trade deficits run with other nations and then halved to reach the numbers that trump presented in the rose garden. in a follow-up series of questions by the associated press, the white house could not say whether the tariff exemptions on imports worth 800 or less would remain in place, possibly shielding some imports from the new taxes. based on the possibility of broad tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most outside analyses by banks and think tanks see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnating growth. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress . president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. how will trumps tariffs work? how soon until prices might rise?apr. 2, 2025, 854 p.m. trump has blunt words on possible car price hikes amid new tariffsmar. 31, 2025, 956 a.m. because trump had hyped his tariffs without providing specifics until wednesday, he provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. powered by

  Title: 'Trump called it liberation day, I call it inflation day': EU parliament's trade chief – video
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-03 08:42:52)
  Content: the president of the european parliaments international trade committee has said trumps declaration that the introduction of tariffs was liberation day for the us would in reality be inflation day. speaking at a press conference in brussels, bernd lange said the us tariffs were unfair and warned that consumers and businesses would bear the cost. its totally clear that these tariffs will increase prices in the united states and i guess also . in the european union uk ministers will respond to us tariffs with calm heads, starmer tells business chiefs trumps tariffs five key takeaways i hope you appreciated this article. before you move on, i wanted to ask whether you could support the guardians journalism as we face the unprecedented challenges of covering this administration. as trump himself observed the first term, everybody was fighting me. in this term, everybody wants to be my friend. hes not entirely wrong. already, several large corporate-owned news organizations have settled multimillion-dollar lawsuits with the president in order to protect their business interests. meanwhile, billionaires have intervened editorially in the news outlets they own to limit potentially unfavorable coverage of the president. the guardian is different we have no interest in being donald trumps or any politicians friend. our allegiance as independent journalists is not to those in power but to the public. whatever happens in the coming months and years, you can rely on the guardian never to bow down to power, nor back down from truth. how are we able to stand firm in the face of intimidation and threats? as journalists say follow the money. the guardian has neither a self-interested billionaire owner nor profit-seeking corporate henchmen pressuring us to appease the rich and powerful. we are funded by our readers and owned by the scott trust whose only financial obligation is to preserve our journalistic mission in perpetuity. whats more, in a time of rising, democracy-threatening misinformation, we make our fiercely independent journalism free to all, with no paywall so that everyone in the us can have access to responsible, fact-based news. with the administration already cracking down on free speech, banning reporters from the oval office, and the president and his allies pursuing lawsuits against news outlets whose stories they dont like, it has never been more urgent, or more perilous, to pursue fair, accurate reporting. can you support the guardian today? we welcome one-off gifts, but if you are able to start a small monthly contribution to help sustain our reporting at this precarious moment for press freedom, we would especially appreciate it. as our thanks to you, we can offer you some great benefits including seeing far fewer fundraising messages like this. weve made it very quick to set up, so we hope youll consider it. thank you.

  Title: Trump’s wall of tariffs is likely to raise prices and cause chaos for business
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-02 21:37:40)
  Content: donald trump is finally making good on his campaign promises to build that wall but instead of steel fencing along the mexican border, it will be constructed from tariffs, and will enclose the entire united states. in his pugnacious and typically rambling speech on the white house lawn on wednesday, trump set out plans for across-the-board import taxes, ranging from 10 to more than 40. the president promised liberation, yet the immediate impact is more likely to be rising prices for us shoppers and corrosive uncertainty for firms, exacerbating an economic slowdown that may already be under way. outside the wall, countries will be affected according to how dependent their economies are on exports to the us and how exposed they are to the global trading system. for some, it is likely to be devastating. the uk will be relieved to be slapped with only the 10 minimum after keir starmers charm offensive, and the eu may have feared worse than 20. for some countries trump outlined much higher rates 46 for vietnam, 49 for cambodia and 29 for pakistan, for example. the precise effects of sweeping tariffs on this historic scale are hard to predict. one factor is how rival economies will respond retaliatory tariffs tend to make a bad situation worse, though they may make short-term political sense see mark carneys poll ratings in canada. another question is whether the dollar may appreciate, somewhat softening the blow for us importers. that may limit the effect on prices, which would otherwise be expected to rise as the cost of importing products and materials increases. the main challenge in assessing the exact impact of the plans, though, is that trumps statement did not mark the end of the period of profound economic uncertainty that began when he arrived in the white house quite the opposite. instead, he has fired the starting gun on a new and inherently unpredictable scramble, in which governments will fire back with their own punitive tariffs at the same time as negotiating hard to try to secure exemptions. as in the uk, where ministers hope to secure an economic agreement, which appears to involve sweeteners for us big tech and lower tariffs on food imports, these talks are likely to have economic consequences of their own. and it remains unclear how amenable trump is likely to be to persuasion. on the one hand, he appears to enjoy the theatre of using tariffs to exact policy concessions, which he can then portray as a winning deal. trump-watchers have sometimes argued that a dramatic slide in stock prices might lead the president to pull back from the harshest version of the policy. his press secretary, karoline leavitt, insisted on tuesday that wall street will be just fine as a result of the tariff package. but in other moments, trump has appeared to suggest a bit of market turbulence might be part of the plan. there is a period of transition, because what were doing is very big, he said in a recent fox news interview in which he also declined to rule out a recession. there is also the small matter of the revenues the administration hopes to raise from tariffs, which it wants to use to fund tax cuts. the white house trade adviser, peter navarro, has suggested the levies could raise an extraordinary 600bn 460bn a year hardly consistent with offering carve-outs to every major economy that comes knocking. caving in would also undermine another of trumps sometimes-contradictory aims persuading firms to create new manufacturing jobs, inside the shelter of the tariff wall. as bewildered trade experts repeatedly said in the run-up to what trump has called liberation day, and are likely to continue to say after trumps outing in the rose garden, guessing what happens next is all but impossible. all this makes for an alarming level of uncertainty which consumers and businesses hate. consumer confidence measures in the us have already been sliding sharply. alongside weeks of headlines about the ambiguous tariff plans, the tens of thousands of abrupt government job losses made by elon musks department of government efficiency seem unlikely to have helped the mood. and in boardrooms, baffled executives may be reluctant to press ahead with significant investments bringing manufacturing back into the us as trump hopes, for example when it is unclear how long the tariffs will endure. whatever the medium-term prospects of jobs and factories coming roaring back to the us, as trump predicted, for now what some had already dubbed a trumpcession appears significantly more likely to happen, than the golden age he has promised.
