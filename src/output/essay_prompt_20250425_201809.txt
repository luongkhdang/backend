  Title: Fake Alpine Quest Mapping App Spotted Spying on Russian Military
  Source: hackread.com (2025-04-22 21:26:10)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Realism, the article highlights the ongoing competition between states (or state-affiliated actors) in the cyber domain. The targeting of Russian military personnel through a compromised app, as evidenced by "fake alpine quest app laced with spyware was used to target russian military android devices, stealing location data, contacts, and sensitive files," demonstrates a pursuit of strategic advantage through intelligence gathering. This suggests a constant state of low-intensity conflict where information is a valuable resource.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that "at the time of writing, the group behind the campaign has not been identified, and it remains unclear whether this operation is domestic or foreign in origin." This lack of immediate attribution, despite similarities to past Ukrainian hacktivist activities, raises questions about the complexity of cyber warfare. Could this ambiguity be intentional, designed to obscure the true source and avoid direct repercussions?

  Title: 100 DAYS OF PUNISHING FOES...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article demonstrates how Trump actively shapes the public's perception by prioritizing certain narratives (e.g., 'political weaponization,' 'lies and abuses') and repeatedly emphasizing them. The text states Trump 'repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate' and 'denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him.' This constant reinforcement influences which issues voters deem important, potentially overshadowing other concerns.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the speed and scope of Trump's actions, noting that 'even the smallest slights drawing reprisals.' This suggests a potential underlying mechanism of personal vendettas driving policy decisions, raising questions about the stability and predictability of the administration's actions. What are the long-term consequences of such personalized governance?; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work.' This raises questions about the ethical implications of such arrangements and whether they constitute a form of extortion or coercion. Does this set a dangerous precedent for future interactions between the government and private entities?

  Content: reuters -hours after swearing an oath to defend the u.s. constitution on january 20, president donald trump signed an executive order directing his attorney general to scour the justice department and other agencies for evidence of political weaponization. the same day, pentagon staff took down a portrait of mark milley, a trump critic who as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been the highest-ranking military officer during trumps first term. that evening, trump stripped his former national security adviser, john bolton - who wrote a memoir critical of trump - of the protective secret service detail he had been given after the justice department said iran had threatened boltons life. in his first 100 days, trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies. these include former intelligence officials who investigated alleged russian ties to his 2016 election campaign and major law firms as well as former biden administration members and prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against him while he was out of power. trumps actions served notice that his campaign promise of political retribution was anything but rhetorical, after he repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate. but the speed and sweep of his actions have caught many by surprise, with even the smallest slights drawing reprisals. the republican president has used the machinery of the state and the power of the presidency to go after people and institutions that have aggrieved him in more expansive ways than any of his predecessors, historians said. its not unusual for presidents to have enemies, said jeremi suri, a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin. what is unusual is for the president to use the entirety of the federal government, not simply to exclude someone, but to directly punish them. trump has made particular use of executive orders - typically used by presidents to direct policy priorities - to target perceived foes by stripping them of security clearances, blocking them from government buildings or directing agencies to probe them for wrongdoing. he has launched multiple federal probes into maine after a verbal spat with the states governor, reached deep into the traditionally independent justice department to fire those he views as disloyal, pulled protective security details from his critics and ordered investigations into former officials who challenged his false claims that his 2020 election loss was rigged. on his first day in office, he removed clearances for 50 former national security officials who had signed a letter suggesting russia was behind a story about salacious material found on a laptop belonging to president joe bidens son hunter. no evidence of russian involvement has emerged. he has also taken away clearances for all three democrats who ran against him in presidential contests biden, hillary clinton and kamala harris. trump has focused much of his attention on the criminal justice system after claiming during his 2024 presidential campaign that his four indictments were motivated by politics. then-president joe bidens administration denied the accusations. in trumps first 100 days, his justice department has fired or demoted dozens of officials, prosecutors and fbi agents, including rank-and-file employees who worked on investigations into trump and the january 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob of trump supporters. in a speech at the justice departments headquarters in february, trump denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him with illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. traditional presidencies have failed to bring meaningful change to the ways of washington, and the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy, a white house spokesman, harrison fields, said in response to questions about trumps retribution efforts and whether they represent an abuse of power. utilizing every tool afforded by the constitution, the trump administration is prioritizing efficiency eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and fulfilling every campaign promise. the ferocity and the scope during his first term, trumps instincts for revenge were sometimes thwarted by his own appointees, many of whom were experienced government hands or establishment republicans. by contrast, trump has filled his second-term administration with steadfast loyalists more likely to back his directives than caution against them. meanwhile, the republican majority in congress has shown little interest in opposing his actions. trump has taken steps as well to eliminate internal watchdogs who might seek to constrain him, purging inspectors general and firing government ethics officials. all administrations, particularly when you see a switch from one party to another, seek to control the executive branch, said historian timothy naftali, the former director of the richard nixon presidential library and museum. its the ferocity and the scope of what hes done that makes it unprecedented. the republican nixon famously had a list of enemies, but he plotted against them in secret. his most aggressive ideas, such as using the tax-collecting internal revenue service to audit his foes, were often blocked by his own officials. other presidents have used their power to penalize rivals in more muted ways, suri said. democrat lyndon johnson sought to discredit his political rival, robert kennedy, in the news media, and republican george w. bush banned brent scowcroft, a former national security adviser, from the white house after scowcroft wrote a column opposing the iraq war. thats often how presidents use their power to go after enemies they keep them out of their administration and spread rumors about them, suri said. trump has frequently intertwined his personal animus against political opponents with his administrations ideological and policy objectives. in february, trump digressed from remarks during a white house meeting with governors to address maine governor janet mills, warning her to comply with an order banning transgender athletes. see you in court, mills, a democrat, replied defiantly. within a day, three separate federal departments had initiated inquiries into whether the state was violating civil rights law, imperiling millions of dollars in federal funding. the justice department sent mills a letter telling her maine was on notice while trump demanded a full-throated apology before the case can be settled. in early april, trumps agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, wrote mills to confirm that some school funding had been frozen. this is only the beginning, rollins warned her. nine days later, the education department said it was taking steps to cut off all federal school funding to the state, and last week attorney general pam bondi announced the justice department had sued maine in federal court. in recent weeks, trump has attacked law firms that once employed attorneys he views as enemies, arguing they undermined the judicial process by doing so. in february, he suspended security clearances for attorneys at the law firm covington burling who had represented smith, the former special counsel investigating him, and sought to cancel any government work the firm had. making little effort to hide his primary motivation, trump suggested sending the pen he used to sign the order to smith as a souvenir. trump has signed executive orders targeting five other law firms, in each case indicating that revenge was an essential factor. his order punishing wilmerhale, for instance, noted that it once employed robert mueller, who investigated whether trumps 2016 campaign had improper connections with russia. nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work on mutually agreed projects backed by the administration. in some cases, trump simply appears determined to get even with former members of his 2017-2021 administration who irked him. this month, the president ordered the justice department to investigate christopher krebs, his former cybersecurity chief who disputed trumps false claims about election fraud in 2020, and miles taylor, a former homeland security official who anonymously wrote a 2019 book critical of trump. signing the executive order targeting the two former officials, trump called taylor a traitor. i think hes guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth, but well find out, he said. dissent isnt unlawful, taylor responded on x. it certainly isnt treasonous. reporting by joseph ax editing by ross colvin and howard goller

  Title: Trump’s ‘anger’ at Putin over Ukraine peace deal delay is just play acting
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-02 12:22:10)
  Content: americas global power and reach are waning by the day as a consequence of donald trumps assaults on the west and his slavish behaviour towards moscow, says world affairs editor sam kiley from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. donald trump is peeved. his officials are starting to spin that his plans for almost instant peace in ukraine may take a lot longer, while vladimir putins business envoy heads for the white house, supposedly to make amends. yet what it truly reveals is that the 47th president continues to be played by the kremlin. trump has unleashed a trade war, expressed colonial designs on two nato members, scrambled ukraines defensive war plans, shown public contempt for europe and set about the pillars of american democracy with a sledgehammer. trump has shown a remarkable ability to interpret moscows deepest desires and to deliver on them. that the us president is now saying he is pissed off with putin and is considering considering increasing tariffs and sanctions on russia, is play acting. the us-russia trade account is worth about 3.5bn 2.8bn. thats nothing. the us doesnt do enough trade with russia to make sanctions or tariffs mean anything. a meaningful threat, one that he has used and applied to ukraine, would have been in the military realm. to force kyiv into agreeing to a ceasefire, trump cut military aid and then refused to share its intelligence with ukraine at a time when the russians were, surprise, surprise, launching a massive offensive to retake the kursk region from kyivs troops. the 30-day ceasefire on the black sea and a cessation in attacks against energy facilities is desperately needed by moscow, not kyiv. ukraine now rules the black sea, and its targeting of russian energy systems is bringing the war back to russia. cutting military aid and intelligence sharing meant that european nations, including the uk, have rushed to ukraines aid and are frantically planning for a new world without the us security umbrella that has kept them safe for 80 years and been mostly funded by the us taxpayer. americas global power and reach are waning by the day as a consequence of trumps assaults on the west and his slavish behaviour towards moscow. and yet the white house sees no need to reverse this. rather, in a series of meetings and calls over the weekend, officials inside the white house and the state department acknowledged that putin is actively resisting washingtons attempts to strike a lasting peace accord and discussed what, if any, economic or diplomatic punishments could push russia closer to a deal, reuters reported. only a team that saw no problem with exploiting russias invasion and mass murder in ukraine to try to force a minerals deal by handing control of most of ukraines resources forever plus backpay on previous funding for its war plus interest could have been blind to russias agenda. russia wants all of ukraines resources too. the us has indicated, not that it is theirs to gift, that the 20 per cent of ukraine that russia has already stolen is moscows for the keeping. russia has been keen to encourage the trump regime to end the us isolation of moscow and get back into business with the oligarchs and crooks who run the multinational russian federation, or empire. to further this idea, kirill dmitriev, the chief of russias sovereign wealth fund and putins special investment and international economic adviser, is heading to talks in the us with steve witkoff, trumps middle east and russia envoy. witkoff was using an unsecured personal mobile phone when he was part of the infamous signal group on which secret military operational plans were being discussed by trumps top intelligence officials, including the heads of the cia and the director of national intelligence. dmitriev, who has a harvard mba and is an old friend of trumps inner circle, will play witkoff like a violin and his tunes will be all russian. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Fears grow SIGNAL leaks make Hegseth top espionage target...
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-23 17:16:37)
  Content: as more develops about the us defense secretary, pete hegseth, and his repeated disclosures of sensitive military intelligence in unsecured signal group chats, there are growing concerns his behavior has weakened the pentagon in the eyes of its foreign adversaries and made him and his entourage a top espionage target. allies, already concerned by donald trumps aggressive tariffs, have also begun to see the us as an intelligence-sharing liability. there are fears that the mounting firings and leak inquiries in hegseths orbit, along with his inability to manage these internal crises, exposes the entire global us war footing especially, if a geopolitical and external crisis comes across his desk. what if a foreign entity, whether it be a state actor or non-state actor, is able to intercept the movements of troops or department personnel, or something like that, capture them and hold them to ransom, said kristofer goldsmith, an iraq war veteran and ceo at task force butler. that kind of thing could very easily happen. earlier in the week, news broke that hegseth had personally created a signal group chat including his wife, brother and about a dozen other people who he then texted highly sensitive information on active strikes in yemen. previously, he discussed similar intelligence in a group chat on the same app, which included top officials in the trump administration and a journalist from the atlantic. former officials serving in national security positions under joe bidens administration also told the guardian on background that the situation is perilous and that hegseth has endangered the secrets of the defense department and the white house. one person said russian and chinese spies were no doubt directly targeting susceptible people in hegseths inner circle. goldsmith, a threat intelligence expert, said there were many scenarios wherein a foreign government could gain access to those chats, without the need to directly compromise hegseths devices. pete hegseth is texting his wife and his wife is posting on instagram, clicks a link, and gets malware on her phone, said goldsmith, describing a hypothetical scenario. then the chinese or the iranians or the russians just happen to be like, oh, shit, weve got mrs hegseth, without even targeting her. to goldsmith, hegseth, who came into power on the heels of publicly characterizing the pentagon as a woke shambles after years of ignoring war fighters, has already undermined the overall power of the us military in his months-long reign. these kinds of leaks, anticipating troop movements, anticipating attacks those can put our adversaries in position to intercept pilots or convoys or ships, which could create an international incident, he said. it could mean a nuclear or a biological or a chemical crisis of some kind. within the geopolitical competition between the us, russia and china, assigning teams of capable intelligence agents trailing, hacking and spying on the every move of your top officials is an open secret. protecting those officials and the sanctity of their communications from those interventions is a well-trodden and technical mission that calls in some of americas most secretive agencies. but if the advice, devices and apps provided to those officials go ignored, foreign adversaries have an opening. hegseths adherence to operational security, opsec for short among national security professionals, referring to the general tradecraft of preventing sensitive information from being leaked, has advertised to foreign adversaries how to compromise him. well, they know what hes operating on, said joe plenzler, a retired veteran of the united states marine corps who served in the wars in iraq and afghanistan. signal is better than most other commercial apps, but its not military-grade encryption. plenzler, who was a public affairs officer in the iraq war under the former secretary of defense gen james mattis, a senior figure in trumps first administration, said he and his boss understood the importance of respecting the secrecy of communications in the field. if any officer or enlisted member had passed classified information over an unsecured or unauthorized device, we would have been immediately removed them from our position, investigated, most likely prosecuted, he said. for an officer, its a career killer. plenzler said mattis told his subordinates when youre leading marines you have to lead by example. the fastest thing that will crack the morale of any unit is the leader that says, do as i say, not as i do. plenzler added that hegseths conduct was inexcusable, especially when divulging some of the kinds of sources and methods, gleaned from intelligence-gathering, that can put peoples lives in danger. what sources are getting burned when secrets get out? people are risking their lives to help the united states, to protect our citizens and our allies, and when these things go sideways, some people are very literally running for their lives, he said. when my former boss was sitting in the chair, i felt a lot better. on monday, during the white house easter egg roll event, hegseth was chatty and defiant with the press in attendance. signal chat controversy? he said to reporters. this is what the media does they take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees, and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations. trump agreed, backing hegseth. hes doing a great job, trump said, dismissively, at the same event.

  Title: Contributor: The Trump administration is ignoring far-right terrorism. That only makes it more dangerous
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-09 10:00:35)
  Content: intelligence chiefs testified recently on capitol hill about the u.s. intelligence communitys newly published annual threat assessment. in a stark departure from previous reports, this years assessment began with an overview of the threats posed by criminal organizations, including drug cartels and transnational gangs, before moving on to detail the challenge of countering jihadist groups like the islamic state and al qaeda and their worldwide networks. before moving on to traditional state-based threats embodied by china, iran and others, the section on nonstate actors concludes with an analysis of cybercriminals, hackers and online fraudsters using ransomware. but conspicuously absent from the report is any mention of transnational far-right extremists, including neo-nazis, white supremacists and others animated by racial or ethnic hatred. this is the same ideology promoted by anders breivik , a norwegian white supremacist who slaughtered 77 people in norway in 2011, and brenton tarrant , an australian far-right extremist who attacked two mosques in christchurch, new zealand, in 2019, killing more than 50 people and wounding more than 40 others. the decision to exclude any mention of far-right terrorism is not necessarily surprising, given president trumps support for certain political terrorists and political violence. but ignoring these threats will not make them go away. the united states is no stranger to far-right extremist terrorism, which reared its ugly head at a synagogue in pittsburgh in october 2018 again at a walmart in el paso in august 2019 and at a supermarket in a predominantly african american section of buffalo, n.y., in may 2022. the perpetrators of each of these attacks engaged with far-right propaganda online and subscribed to some version of the great replacement theory , also advocated by breivik and tarrant, which conjures a global cabal of jews and elites actively looking to replace the white christian population with ethnic and religious minorities. it should not be surprising that the first annual threat assessment from this trump administration ranks gangs and cartels as the top danger, given the presidents emphasis on deportations. but to go further by completely omitting far-right terrorists fundamentally ignores a core threat to american democracy. just a year earlier, the 2024 threat assessment explained that the transnational racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists rmve movement, in particular motivated by white supremacy, will continue to foment violence across europe, south america, australia, canada, and new zealand inspiring the lone actor or small-cell attacks that pose a significant threat to u.s. persons. theres no reason to think that threat has disappeared. while intelligence community threat assessments should always remain politically neutral, it seems evident that the trump administration put its thumb on the scale to influence the analysis, generating a result that directly reflects trumps policy priorities. more recently and at the urging of trumps consigliere du jour, the tesla chief executive elon musk those priorities have included labeling attacks against tesla dealerships as domestic terrorism. during his first term in office, trump largely ignored the threat posed by far-right extremists and suggested that he would look into designating far-left movements like antifa as terrorist organizations. a mountain of evidence shows that the threat from the far right was far more lethal. the latest intelligence community assessment follows the unprecedented decision to label mexican drug cartels and venezuelan and salvadoran gangs as foreign terrorist organizations. there is no doubt that these groups are violent and dangerous, but they are motivated by profit, not politics, and as such, are more accurately characterized as criminals, not terrorists. however, the designation of venezuelan crime ring tren de aragua as a terror group served as a controversial basis for the trump administration to use the alien enemies act to deport venezuelan nationals some of whom have been reported as having no ties to the group, and at least one of whom had legal status and was protected from deportation by a court order that the administration ignored. in his first few months in office, trump has intimidated opponents in politics and media, cowed powerful law firms and even co-opted tech titans who were once among his loudest critics. but distorting the intelligence communitys threat assessment represents a special kind of danger. one of the core aspects of the relationship between intelligence officials and policymakers in constitutional federal republics like the united states is that the intelligence community should exercise autonomy and be immune to the politics of the day. while the president has every right to reorder his priorities, the intelligence community should not weight threats more significantly based on the presidents perceptions or wishes. if our country learned anything from the iraq war debacle, its that policymakers should not influence intelligence community analysis. the danger is apparent not only in the distorted assessment but also in personnel decisions and allocation of resources. even before the white houses department of government efficiency began to jettison entire agencies of the federal government, a shift was underway in which resources and personnel were being moved away from counterterrorism and toward strategic competition with near peers like china and russia. now, almost overnight, tens of millions of dollars in funding earmarked for research studying radicalization, violent extremism and terrorism prevention has been cut. that includes a 3-million database that was maintained by researchers to track and study domestic terrorism threats. the trump administrations actions the loss of personnel and funding, the politicization of counterterrorism leave the u.s. much more vulnerable to an attack than at any time in recent memory. jason m. blazakis, a professor of practice at the middlebury institute of international studies, was director of the state departments counterterrorism finance and designations office in the bureau of counterterrorism from 2008 to 2018. colin p. clarke is the director of research at the soufan group, an intelligence and security consulting firm based in new york city.

  Title: Taibbi: How An Obama Executive Order Led To The Censorship Industrial Complex
  Source: www.zerohedge.com (2025-04-04 21:40:00)
  Content: authored by ian schwartz via realclearpolitics, at tuesdays house foreign affairs subcommittee hearing, matt taibbi explained how an obama executive order led to the censorship industrial complex. matt taibbi mr. chairman, madam ranking member, thank you. my name is matt taibbi, im the editor of the independent site racket, and ive been covering digital censorship issues since 2018, the fictional ones. on march 14th, 2016, barack obama signed executive order 13721, developing a new integrated global engagement center to support government-wide counterterrorism communications activities directed abroad. it directed the secretary of state to create a new body, the gec or gec, to quote, counter the messaging and diminish the influence of international terrorist organizations, including isil, al-qaeda, and other violent extremists abroad. seven years later, while working on a story involving internal communications at twitter, i found myself reading emails between gec officials and twitter executives about subjects ranging from covid-19 to the 2020 election to donald trump. once, mr. chairman, you were right to point out that they were once focused abroad, but by this time, gec officials were largely concerned with domestic english language accounts, people with no ties to terror groups or relationships with adversary nations like iran, china, or russia. when i went back this weekend through those documents to find examples of gec pressuring twitter to remove or deamplify americans accused of misinformation, i found an exchange that we twitter files reporters missed in 2023. a lawyer at the company asked several other executives if they had any, quote, appetite for writing gec a letter to ask them to stop going to the media with sensationalist claims about epidemics of foreign bots. one of the companys senior communications executives gave a remarkably candid answer. from my chair, it would be very helpful, he wrote. referencing a well-known washington reporter, he went on. the pre-briefed ellen nakashima article in the post on bernie and this coronavirus story, no heads up, are making me worry a little about how good faith these players will be through the press into 2020. so it wasnt just conservatives, it was also bernie sanders. the date on that email was february 24th, 2020. three days after the washington post ran a devastating feature titled bernie sanders briefed by us officials that russia is trying to help his presidential campaign. this was an extremely impactful story that opened the floodgates on a conspiracy theory that sanders was the recipient of russian help. it claimed bots helping bernie online were part of, quote, russias broader interest in sowing division in the united states and uncertainty about the validity of american elections. in response to this odd sequel of claims about russian bots aiding donald trump, the companys head of trust and safety, yul roth, gave an unflattering description of gecs methods. quote, they use brandwatch to monitor a handful of openly russian accounts, for instance rt, and an unspecified number of accounts that they baselessly assert are inauthentic. this is the exact formula we previously found behind another often used online tool called hamilton 68, whose founders were also quoted in the post piece. hamilton 68 mixed a smattering of real russian accounts with a crowd of mostly american, mostly anti-establishment accounts to create a dashboard that synthesized falsely the appearance of russian social media backing for everything from the devin nunes memo to the parkland shooting. although many of the most controversial stories about gec involved their funding of commercial media scoring operations that downranked conservative news outlets, the gec also pressured twitter about left-leaning figures like sanders, anti-war accounts, libertarians, and independents, as well as conservatives. they managed this by using a trick that gave domestic propaganda the appearance of a counter-terrorist operation. gec sent out reports that would first identify a few social media accounts with real ties to russia or china or iran. then it would separately list accounts they called highly connective to that countrys propaganda ecosystem. these would be american or european citizens with inconvenient views. for instance, gec identified the twitter accounts of former italian prime minister giuseppe conte and former italian democratic party secretary nicola zingaretti, who was often compared to bernie, as being highly connective to russia. all he had to do to get on the list was retweet what they called anti-us propaganda, or gecs subjective definition of pro-russian propaganda. no actual connection was required. through this means, the gec exactly rehabilitated the fellow-traveler concept used by infamous smear artists and witch hunters from history, from leon trotsky to the house un-american affairs committee. it was a way to accuse someone who hasnt done anything wrong of guilt by ideological association. and ill just wrap up, ive gone over my time, but they werent looking for misinformation and disinformation, they were looking for orthodoxy and unorthodoxy, obedience and disobedience. the idea behind gec in particular was finding a way to propagandize american citizens and encourage acceptance of official policy the way weve always done to foreign populations. its a flagrant violation of first amendment ideals and should be eradicated from the government completely. no one should have this tool, not democrats, not the trump administration, nobody. gentlemans time has expired. thank you.

  Title: Democrats decry reported dismissal of NSA director Tim Haugh
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-04 19:00:01)
  Content: top congressional democrats are protesting against the firing of gen tim haugh as director of the national security agency nsa, with one lawmaker saying the decision makes all of us less safe. haugh and his civilian deputy at the nsa, wendy noble, have been dismissed from their roles, the washington post reported late on thursday, with cnn reporting likewise, both outlets citing multiple unnamed officials and other senior sources close to the matter who had requested anonymity. the ousting had not been officially confirmed by the government or the individuals by friday afternoon, but the nsa website had been updated with both haugh and noble no longer listed in their roles. lt gen william j hartman is now listed there as acting director of the nsa and sheila thomas as his acting deputy. haugh also headed us cyber command, which coordinates the pentagons cybersecurity operations. hartman has been appointed acting head of the command, according to its website. the nsa notified congressional leadership and top lawmakers of the national security committees of haughs firing late on wednesday but did not give reasons, the associated press reported, citing a source. senior military leaders were only informed on thursday, the news agency said. the nsa declined to comment and referred the guardian to the department of defense, which said it would provide more information when it became available. outrage from critics was fulsome. senator mark warner, vice-chair of the senate intelligence committee, said in a statement general haugh has served our country in uniform, with honor and distinction, for more than 30 years. at a time when the united states is facing unprecedented cyber threats how does firing him make americans any safer? representative jim himes, the ranking member on the house intelligence committee, said he was deeply disturbed by the decision. i have known general haugh to be an honest and forthright leader who followed the law and put national security first i fear those are precisely the qualities that could lead to his firing in this administration, himes added. the intelligence committee and the american people need an immediate explanation for this decision, which makes all of us less safe. senator jack reed, a democrat from rhode island, said donald trump has given a priceless gift to china, russia, iran, and north korea by purging competence from our national security leadership. in addition to the other military leaders and national security officials trump has fired, he is sending a chilling message throughout the ranks dont give your best military advice, or you may face consequences, reed added. earlier on thursday, donald trump said he had fired some white house national security council officials, a move that came a day after far-right activist laura loomer raised concerns directly to him about staff loyalty. loomer, during her oval office conversation with trump, urged the president to purge staffers she deemed insufficiently loyal to his make america great again agenda, according to several people familiar with the matter. they all spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive personnel manner. loomer posted on x in the first moments of friday morning nsa director tim haugh and his deputy wendy noble have been disloyal to president trump. that is why they have been fired. she added a screed about how they were hired by joe biden during his presidency and were, she said, hand picked by mark milley, then chair of the joint chiefs of staff, the most senior uniformed officer in the military. milley served trump in his first term in the white house but has since turned fiercely critical, calling the president dangerous and fascist to the core, and was fired in the early days of trumps second term. the 47th us president then also revoked milleys security clearance. biden, the 46th us president, had preemptively pardoned milley in his final days in office, following threats from trump that the veteran was treasonous and should face the death penalty. loomer added haugh was referred for firing and noble was haughs obama loving protégé who was nominated by biden and promoted diversity, equity and inclusion at the agency. loomer noted this is called vetting. she also said noble was a protege of james clapper, director of national intelligence in barack obamas presidency, and said clapper should be in prison. trump spoke to reporters on air force one on thursday afternoon after the earlier firing of six national security agency staffers below the level of haugh and noble, based on recommendations from loomer, a extremist cheerleader for trump and a white supremacist with an incendiary social media presence who has no political experience outside of unsuccessfully running for us congress in florida twice. always were letting go of people, trump said. people that we dont like or people that we dont think can do the job or people that may have loyalties to somebody else. the firings come as trumps national security adviser mike waltz continues to fight calls for his ouster after using the publicly available encrypted signal app to discuss planning for the sensitive 15 march military operation targeting houthi militants in yemen. warner said on thursday night it is astonishing, too, that president trump would fire the nonpartisan, experienced leader of the national security agency while still failing to hold any member of his team accountable for leaking classified information on a commercial messaging app even as he apparently takes staffing direction on national security from a discredited conspiracy theorist in the oval office. haugh met last month with elon musk, whose so-called department of government efficiency, or doge, has roiled the federal government by slashing personnel and budgets at dozens of agencies. in a statement, the nsa said the meeting was intended to ensure both organizations were aligned with the new administrations priorities. haugh had led both the nsa and cyber command since 2023. both departments play leading roles in the nations cybersecurity. the nsa also supports the military and other national security agencies by collecting and analysing a vast amount of data and information globally. cyber command is known as americas first line of defence in cyberspace and also plans offensive cyber-operations for potential use against adversaries. defense secretary pete hegseth recently ordered the office to pause some offensive cyber-operations against russia, in another sign of how trumps administration is transforming the work of the nations intelligence community. renée burton, a cybersecurity expert previously working for the nsa, told cnn the removal of the personnel was alarming and the disruption would expose the country to new risk. the associated press contributed reporting

  Content: some of the democratic partys core political groups are preparing for the possibility that president donald trumps allies may soon launch criminal investigations that could handicap democratic infrastructure new york - as president donald trump pushes the historical boundaries of executive power, some of the democratic partys core political institutions are preparing for the possibility that the federal government may soon launch criminal investigations against them. the democrats dominant national fundraising platform, actblue, and the partys largest protest group, indivisible, are working with their attorneys for just such a scenario, according to officials within both organizations. trumps top political allies have suggested both groups should face prosecution. other democratic allies are planning for trump-backed legal crackdowns as well. wary of antagonizing the president, most prefer to stay anonymous for now. every one of our clients is concerned about being arbitrarily targeted by the trump administration. we are going to great lengths to help clients prepare for or defend themselves, said ezra reese, political law chair at elias law group, which represents democratic groups and candidates and is chaired by marc elias, the lawyer who has himself been a trump target. an fbi spokesperson declined to comment when asked about potential investigations into actblue and indivisible. but white house press secretary karoline leavitt did not downplay the threat of a potential criminal probe when asked specifically whether trump wants the fbi, the treasury department or any other federal agency to investigate democratic groups. anyone who has not broken the law should not be worried, leavitt told the associated press. if you have broken the law and engaged in the weaponization of justice, then you should be worried. its that simple. indeed, far from distancing themselves from talk of retribution, many key republicans are embracing it. trumps allies argue they are justified in seeking vengeance due to the four criminal prosecutions against trump, one of which led to multiple felony convictions in new york. theres no evidence former president joe biden influenced the trump prosecutions in any way. matt schlapp, president of the american conservative union, said democrats needed to be taught not to touch a hot stove. someone needs to get burned for all this activity or theyre just gonna do it again, he said. and thats not hypocrisy thats justice. trump has made no secret of his plans to use the power of the federal government to target domestic political adversaries. during a norm-breaking speech at the department of justice last month, trump cast himself as the countrys chief law enforcement officer, a title ordinarily reserved for the attorney general. on wednesday, trump signed an executive order instructing the justice department to investigate miles taylor, a former department of homeland security official who anonymously penned a book highly critical of his first presidency. trump said that taylor was likely guilty of treason, a crime that can carry the death penalty. indivisible has been perhaps the most important group in the democratic resistance since trump returned to the white house. the groups leadership in washington holds regular calls with state-based activists and recently released a detailed protest guide, which offers specific guidance to hundreds of local chapters across the country. this year alone, indivisible groups have hosted more than 1,000 protests covering every state in the nation. the group was a key organizer in the recent hands off! protests that attracted hundreds of thousands of people across the country. trump top adviser and billionaire elon musk has publicly condemned indivisible as criminals. the statement was an apparent reference to violent attacks against tesla dealerships and vehicles, which have spiked in recent weeks. indivisibles leadership released a guide earlier in the year encouraging protests outside tesla dealerships, although the guide instructs protesters to remain peaceful and stay off private property. no charges are known to have been filed against indivisible or its leaders. but indivisible co-founder ezra levin says its critical that democratic institutions work together to speak out against the threats posed by the trump administration. his organization has been discussing contingency plans with attorneys and other activists in the event that he or other indivisible leaders face criminal charges. they may try to come at us directly, or its as likely that their non-state actors are inspired by their lies and propaganda, and try to come at us individually, levin said. and that is a risk in a moment where youre facing anti-democratic threats like we are. our choice is, we can be quiet and hope that they wont target us, or we can try to work as a mass opposition, he continued. if youre not willing to do that, what are you doing here? musk, backed by several republican members of congress, has also called on the fbi to investigate actblue, alleging that the democratic partys main fundraising platform has skirted campaign finance laws and allowed foreign nationals to make illegal contributions to democratic candidates. i think the fbis going to do something on actblue soon, charlie kirk, a key trump ally who founded the conservative group turning point usa, said at a political event last month in wisconsin. actblue officials this week told the ap that they would continue to cooperate with a congressional investigation led by house republicans into allegations of fraud within the organization. actblue is preparing a second batch of documents to comply with a new request by house republicans. additionally, two actblue staffers are expected to testify before a house panel behind closed doors later this month. multiple house republicans in recent weeks have encouraged federal law enforcement agencies to pursue requested criminal investigations into actblue. rep. darrell issa, r-calif., has asked the treasury department to investigate allegations that the nonprofit processed payments to terror-linked organizations. separately, rep. andy biggs, r-ariz., sent a letter to the fbi last month claiming that actblue is being used to to skirt the integrity of federal campaign finance laws by allowing foreign nationals to contribute to campaigns, among other allegations of criminal wrongdoing. it must be emphasized that these allegations, were they to prove true, would indicate a serious threat to the integrity of our elections, besides the victimization of american citizens, biggs wrote. actblue said it is preparing for the possibility of many different attacks on various fronts, including investigations by the fbi or the treasury department. meanwhile, democratic candidates are relying on actblue to fund their campaigns as never before. donors have given more than 400 million to democratic candidates through actblue over the first three months of the year, the organization told the ap. the fundraising haul represents the most money raised in any first quarter in actblues two-decade history. while republicans accuse the group of being funded by wealthy donors, actblue acts as a passthrough between donors and candidates thats funded by a 3.95 processing fee on each donation. these unfounded attacks havent shaken us theyve sharpened our resolve to fuel democratic wins, actblue spokesperson megan hughes said. as our first-quarter fundraising demonstrates, democratic grassroots donors are engaged, undeterred and ready to meet this moment. leavitt is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the ap on first- and fifth amendment grounds. the ap says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. the white house says the ap is not following an executive order to refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america.

  Title: Analysis-Trump Uses Power Against Foes Unlike Any Other Modern US President
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-02 05:05:38)
  Content: by james oliphant and jeff mason washington reuters -in just 10 weeks in office, donald trump has imposed his will on perceived adversaries in business, politics, the media and allied nations by leveraging power in ways no other modern u.s. president has tried. his administration has sought the arrest and deportation of student protesters, withheld federal funds from colleges, ostracized law firms tied to his political opponents, threatened judges and tried to pressure journalists. at the same time trump has downsized the federal government dramatically and purged it of workers who could stand in his way. central to this effort has been trumps use of policy-making executive orders to target opponents as never before. he has been unafraid to employ lawsuits, public threats and the power of the federal purse to bring institutions to heel. what unites all these efforts is trumps desire to shut down every potential source of resistance to the maga agenda and to his personal power, said peter shane, a law professor at new york university. some targets have rushed to placate the president, a few have fought back and many are still trying to figure out how to respond. many of trumps actions are being challenged in courts, where some judges have tried to slow him down. the stunning speed and breadth of the republican presidents actions have caught democrats, public-service unions, ceos and the legal profession off guard. trumps supporters say he is simply using the full reach of his presidency to achieve the goals he set as a candidate. hes laid out these broad battle lines, whether its with people that he thinks have tried to ruin him personally, whether its with people he thinks have tried to ruin western civilization, said republican strategist scott jennings, a longtime adviser to senator mitch mcconnell. everything he said he was going to do on the campaign, hes doing. trumps aims are not just political. his actions show he wants to reorder american society with an all-powerful executive at the top, where financial, political and cultural institutions carry his stamp and where opposition is either co-opted or curtailed. with a compliant congress controlled by his party and a u.s. supreme court dominated by conservatives, trump is operating with fewer checks on his power than any of his modern-day predecessors. trump has attempted to subdue and cajole his adversaries on an almost-daily basis, backed by the fearsome might of the law enforcement and regulatory agencies at his command. he has often succeeded. he managed to wring concessions out of several of his targets, including storied columbia university, powerful law firms and corporate titans such as meta and disney. all of them settled with the white house rather than endure the pressure, surrendering some independence and setting what some view as damaging precedents. others are taking preemptive measures to avoid trumps wrath. more than 20 of americas largest companies and financial firms, including goldman sachs, google and pepsico, have rolled back diversity programs that had drawn trumps ire. three law firms cut deals with the administration rather than risk losing their lawyers security clearances, access to government buildings and perhaps, as a result, clients, while three others targeted by trumps executive orders sued in response. trumps orders have also been his vehicle to remake the government, deport alleged venezuelan gang members with little due process and levy tariffs against u.s. trading partners. he has sued u.s. media corporations and silenced the voice of america, taken control of the kennedy center, a leading arts facility, and sought to put curbs on the smithsonian institution, whose mission is to chronicle history. his administration has detained student protesters whose political views it says are a threat to the country. trump has pushed a mineral-rights deal on ukraines leadership with the veiled threat of ending u.s. support for kyiv in the russian war in ukraine. he has threatened nato ally denmark to try to wrest control of greenland, spoken of annexing canada and threatened to take the panama canal back from its home country. tailored strikes mark zaid, a washington lawyer who represents whistleblowers against the federal government and who himself had his security clearance stripped away by trump, said the presidents conduct is like nothing he has seen in his 30-year career. executive orders have never been designed to specifically target individuals nor non-government actors for purposes of retaliation or retribution, zaid said. the white house and trumps allies deny the president is acting out of revenge. a white house spokesman said more traditional approaches have failed to bring meaningful change. unconventional is precisely what the american people voted for when they elected president trump, white house spokesman harrison fields said. the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy. in his first term from 2017-2021, trump was hamstrung by a variety of factors a federal probe into russian interference, his aides lack of experience and greater democratic opposition in congress. with those roadblocks gone, an emboldened trump has demonstrated at the start of his second term that he has learned how to use the resources available to him more fully to get what he wants. he really does know how to pull the levers of power this time, more so than last time, said rina shah, a republican strategist. claire wofford, a political science professor at the college of charleston, said trump has used executive orders not only to push forward a policy agenda, but also to send messages to his political base, as in his attempt to scale back birthright citizenship, and to test the limits of his power, as with his invocation of an 18th-century law to designate some migrants as alien enemies. what strikes me most at this point is how strategic trump is - but in new ways, wofford said. funding and litigation in cases such as with columbia university, trump has used the federal purse as a cudgel, concluding his targets have financial interests that make them vulnerable to coercion. in other cases, he has used the courts, forcing companies such as disney and meta into favorable settlements after trump filed lawsuits against them. cbs news, another trump lawsuit target, is under pressure to settle its suit because its parent, paramount, is eager to have its proposed merger with skydance media approved by trump administration regulators. but not every institution has bent the knee. many of trumps actions, particularly those regarding his cuts in government, remain tied up in federal court. in the last two weeks alone, judges have ruled against trump in matters challenging his deportation policies, attacks against law firms and plans to eliminate government agencies. in response, trump and his allies have called for judges who rule against the administration to be impeached and drawn a rare rebuke from chief justice john roberts. walter olson, a senior fellow at the libertarian cato institute, said trumps attacks on law firms and judges are without precedent and are reminiscent of other nations with authoritarian regimes. clipping the wings of law firms and the courts, olson said, is the behavior of an autocrat. reporting by james oliphant and jeff masonediting by colleen jenkins and howard goller

  Title: Trump’s attacks on law firms are an attack on law itself | David Cole and Amrit Singh
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-04 12:00:53)
  Content: if you are systematically engaged in lawbreaking, lawyers can be very annoying. they sue, and their suits may lead courts to declare your actions illegal. so donald trump, who has launched his second term with a blizzard of blatantly illegal actions, many of which have been suspended by the courts, has decided to address the problem at its root. hes targeting lawyers, punishing them for doing nothing more than filing lawsuits he opposes, or hiring lawyers he does not like. he has issued unprecedented executive orders penalizing five of the nations major law firms, and more are likely to come. these tactics, blatantly illegal, are designed with one goal in mind to chill lawyers willingness to challenge his illegal actions. they are a fundamental attack on the foundation of the rule of law. and they are achieving their purpose, not because they are legal they obviously are not but because too many law firms are surrendering to trumps illegal demands. these measures take a page from the book of other autocrats around the world. just last week, the turkish president recep tayyip erdoğans government detained lawyers for representing people protesting the arrest of his main political rival, istanbuls mayor. erdoğans attacks on the legal profession stretch back more than a decade. putins russia is persecuting lawyers for the late russian opposition leader alexei navalny simply for carrying out their professional duties. and in maduros venezuela, lawyers defending political detainees are being subjected to surveillance, threats, arrest and smear campaigns, increasingly leaving the detainees without access to counsel of their choice. these tactics are designed with one goal in mind to chill lawyers willingness to challenge his illegal actions trumps executive orders make no attempt to hide their unconstitutional retaliatory motive. they single out individual law firms by name, complain about the firms cases and association with individuals trump regards as his enemies, and impose a series of sanctions lifting security clearances for all their lawyers, barring federal business with them, excluding them from federal buildings which means they cant even go to court and requiring federal contractors to disclose whether they have used the firm. in an order targeting wilmerhale, one of the nations most prestigious law firms, trump complains that it hired robert mueller, the former fbi director who investigated possible russian interference in the 2016 election. another order, directed against the law firm jenner block, targets its pro bono representation of transgender individuals and immigrants. still another order punishes the law firm perkins coie for, among other things, filing suits challenging voter identification laws as impermissibly barring access to the ballot. and an executive memorandum, issued on 22 march, threatens to sanction lawyers and their firms including in particular those at the immigration bar who litigate against the federal government. the order directs the attorney general to review all lawsuits against the federal government over the past eight years and going forward, and to recommend to trump sanctions against lawyers or firms involved in cases the attorney general deems frivolous. these orders are blatantly unconstitutional. filing lawsuits to vindicate voting rights, lgbtq equality or fair treatment of immigrants is protected by the first amendment, which guarantees the right to petition for a redress of grievances. and law firms also have a first amendment right to choose whom to hire as partners, regardless of what trump thinks of their lawyering skills. the orders are classic government retaliation for the exercise of first amendment rights. wilmerhale, jenner and perkins coie each immediately challenged the orders in federal court, and in each case judges have blocked the order the day the suit was filed. the government has no even colorable defense for what the president is doing. but, disturbingly, four other major firms paul weiss, skadden arps, milbank and willkie farr have succumbed to trumps illegal demands, the latter three even before an executive order was issued against them. shockingly, each firm has agreed to commit millions of dollars in pro bono work to causes that trump supports, as well as accepting lawless intrusions on their hiring and employment practices. the firms could have sued, and would certainly have prevailed had they done so, for the same reasons the other three firms won. no judge would uphold such orders. but the firms chose instead to compromise, fearing that, even if they won in court, they would lose in the market, as clients who needed to do business with the federal government would abandon them for firms that had not been placed on trumps enemies list. they put their considerable take-home pay over their principles and have been roundly and justly criticized within the legal community for having done so. this is precisely the kind of anticipatory obedience that the yale historian timothy snyder and new york times columnist m gessen warn marks the beginning of autocratic takeovers. if the united states is to be governed by the rule of law, lawyers and law firms cannot bow down to such unlawful assaults on the legal professions independence. their duties as officers of the court require them to stand and fight. if lawyers are afraid to challenge unlawful actions by the administration, trump will be free to act extra-legally. it has long been a bedrock of the american system that anyone harmed by official action can challenge that action in court, even where the official is the president himself. but that depends on lawyers maintaining their independence. trumps first two months have seen widespread attacks on those most vulnerable immigrants, transgender individuals and members of other minority groups. lawyers and big corporate law firms are not exactly the vulnerable themselves. trump is attacking them because they can defend the vulnerable, and block his illegal actions in court. his executive orders have in particular objected to the firms pro bono work, done without fee, for indigent clients, often seeking to hold the government accountable. one by one, trump is picking off his potential opposition, publicly reveling in its growing acquiescence. as each law firm folds, looking only to its own bottom line, it undermines not only its own standing, but the legal profession itself. by contrast, the three law firms who have challenged trumps executive orders and the lawyers who have taken on their cases are fighting not only for their own rights, but for the rule of law. their principled resistance is precisely what we need if the united states is to remain a constitutional democracy.

  Title: WIRE: Group using AI to snoop on federal workers...
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-10 20:10:38)
  Content: by alexandra ulmer, marisa taylor, jeffrey dastin and alexandra alper reuters -trump administration officials have told some u.s. government employees that elon musks doge team of technologists is using artificial intelligence to surveil at least one federal agencys communications for hostility to president donald trump and his agenda, said two people with knowledge of the matter. while much of musks department of government efficiency remains shrouded in secrecy, the surveillance would mark an extraordinary use of technology to identify expressions of perceived disloyalty in a workforce already upended by widespread firings and severe cost cutting. the doge team is also using the signal app to communicate, according to one other person with direct knowledge of the matter, potentially violating federal record-keeping rules because messages can be set to disappear after a period of time. and they have heavily deployed musks grok ai chatbot an aspiring chatgpt rival as part of their work slashing the federal government, said that person. reuters could not establish exactly how grok was being used. the white house, doge and musk did not respond to requests for comment. the use of ai and signal reinforces concerns among cybersecurity experts and government ethicists that doge is operating with limited transparency and that billionaire musk or the trump administration could use information gathered with ai to further their own interests, or to go after political targets. kathleen clark, a government ethics expert at washington university in st. louis, said doges use of privacy-focused signal adds to growing concerns over data security practices after top trump administration officials came under fire last month for the mistaken inclusion of a journalist in a group chat about high-level planning for military operations in yemen. if theyre using signal and not backing up every message to federal files, then they are acting unlawfully, she said. reuters interviews with nearly 20 people with knowledge of doges operations and an examination of hundreds of pages of court documents from lawsuits challenging doges access to data highlight its unorthodox usage of ai and other technology in federal government operations. at the environmental protection agency, for instance, some epa managers were told by trump appointees that musks team is rolling out ai to monitor workers, including looking for language in communications considered hostile to trump or musk, the two people said. the epa, which enforces laws such as the clean air act and works to protect the environment, has come under intense scrutiny by the trump administration. since january, it has put nearly 600 employees on leave and said it will eliminate 65 of its budget, which could require further staffing reductions. trump-appointed officials who had taken up epa posts told managers that doge was using ai to monitor communication apps and software, including microsoft teams, which is widely used for virtual calls and chats, said the two sources familiar with these comments. we have been told they are looking for anti-trump or anti-musk language, a third source familiar with the epa said. reuters could not independently confirm if the ai was being implemented. the trump officials said doge would be looking for people whose work did not align with the administrations mission, the first two sources said. be careful what you say, what you type and what you do, a manager said, according to one of the sources. after publication of this story, the epa acknowledged in a statement that it was looking at ai to better optimize agency functions and administrative efficiencies but said it was not using ai as it makes personnel decisions in concert with doge. it did not directly address whether it was using ai to surveil workers. musk has depicted doge as a tech-driven effort to make the u.s. federal government more efficient by targeting waste, fraud and abuse. he has said the goal was to trim 1 trillion in spending, or 15 of the u.s. annual budget. few dispute the u.s. government and its aging computer systems are due for modernization. but democrats say musk and trump are purging the government of non-partisan public servants and installing loyalists who would turn a blind eye to corruption. many republicans and independents are also critical of doges actions. clark, the ethics specialist, said the prospective surveillance was worrisome. it sounds like an abuse of government power to suppress or deter speech that the president of the united states doesnt like, she said. last year, before trump was elected, musk suggested ai could be used to replace government workers, according to a person with direct knowledge of his comments. the concept was that through taking the government data that they could build the most dynamic ai system ever, the person said, adding that ai could then do the work. the complex endeavor would entail teaching ai systems to automate some of the work currently done by federal employees. as a special government employee, musk is prohibited under ethics laws from involving himself in government activities that would benefit him or his companies. transparency questions in addition to the use of signal, some doge staffers are bypassing other vetting processes and chains of custody for official government documents by working simultaneously out of google docs instead of circulating single copies of drafts, a source briefed by a government official said. theres multiple people in one google doc editing things simultaneously, the source said, referring to the online word processing software. that was partly how doge was working so quickly, the source added. the trump administration has argued that doge, as an arm of the executive office of the president, is not subject to laws that allow the public to seek access to records produced by government agencies. citing doges unusual secrecy, including its use of signal, a federal judge on march 10 ordered the group to start handing records to citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington, an ethics watchdog that had sued to request doge documents under federal freedom of information laws. as of monday, the watchdog said, no records had been turned over. as musk embeds his young doge team of engineers and aides deep inside the governments digital infrastructure, accusations that doge is deliberately operating in secrecy have emerged in court cases challenging the authority of musk, the worlds richest man, to remake the federal government. doge employees have dramatically tightened administrative controls at some agencies, keeping staffers in the dark while making significant operational changes, according to interviews and court filings. when musks team took control of the governments human resources agency, the office of personnel management, in late january, they shut opm employees out of a database containing sensitive personal information of tens of millions of current and former federal workers, according to court filings and reuters previous reporting. opm is at the heart of the administrations vision to shrink the government, issuing government-wide directives that are seen as blueprints for downsizing the civil service. since late january, more than 100 tech staff at opm have lost access to the cloud where key applications are stored, according to two people familiar with the matter. only two people still have access one career staffer and greg hogan, a political appointee who worked at an ai startup and is now opms chief information officer, the sources added. hogan did not respond to a request for comment. ulmer and dastin reported from san francisco taylor and alper reported from washington. additional reporting by joseph tanfani, valerie volcovici and humeyra pamuk. editing by jason szep

  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article demonstrates how Trump actively shapes the public's perception by prioritizing certain narratives (e.g., 'political weaponization,' 'lies and abuses') and repeatedly emphasizing them. The text states Trump 'repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate' and 'denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him.' This constant reinforcement influences which issues voters deem important, potentially overshadowing other concerns.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the speed and scope of Trump's actions, noting that 'even the smallest slights drawing reprisals.' This suggests a potential underlying mechanism of personal vendettas driving policy decisions, raising questions about the stability and predictability of the administration's actions. What are the long-term consequences of such personalized governance?; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work.' This raises questions about the ethical implications of such arrangements and whether they constitute a form of extortion or coercion.

  Content: reuters -hours after swearing an oath to defend the u.s. constitution on january 20, president donald trump signed an executive order directing his attorney general to scour the justice department and other agencies for evidence of political weaponization. the same day, pentagon staff took down a portrait of mark milley, a trump critic who as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been the highest-ranking military officer during trumps first term. that evening, trump stripped his former national security adviser, john bolton - who wrote a memoir critical of trump - of the protective secret service detail he had been given after the justice department said iran had threatened boltons life. in his first 100 days, trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies. these include former intelligence officials who investigated alleged russian ties to his 2016 election campaign and major law firms as well as former biden administration members and prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against him while he was out of power. trumps actions served notice that his campaign promise of political retribution was anything but rhetorical, after he repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate. but the speed and sweep of his actions have caught many by surprise, with even the smallest slights drawing reprisals. the republican president has used the machinery of the state and the power of the presidency to go after people and institutions that have aggrieved him in more expansive ways than any of his predecessors, historians said. its not unusual for presidents to have enemies, said jeremi suri, a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin. what is unusual is for the president to use the entirety of the federal government, not simply to exclude someone, but to directly punish them. trump has made particular use of executive orders - typically used by presidents to direct policy priorities - to target perceived foes by stripping them of security clearances, blocking them from government buildings or directing agencies to probe them for wrongdoing. he has launched multiple federal probes into maine after a verbal spat with the states governor, reached deep into the traditionally independent justice department to fire those he views as disloyal, pulled protective security details from his critics and ordered investigations into former officials who challenged his false claims that his 2020 election loss was rigged. on his first day in office, he removed clearances for 50 former national security officials who had signed a letter suggesting russia was behind a story about salacious material found on a laptop belonging to president joe bidens son hunter. no evidence of russian involvement has emerged. he has also taken away clearances for all three democrats who ran against him in presidential contests biden, hillary clinton and kamala harris. trump has focused much of his attention on the criminal justice system after claiming during his 2024 presidential campaign that his four indictments were motivated by politics. then-president joe bidens administration denied the accusations. in trumps first 100 days, his justice department has fired or demoted dozens of officials, prosecutors and fbi agents, including rank-and-file employees who worked on investigations into trump and the january 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob of trump supporters. in a speech at the justice departments headquarters in february, trump denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him with illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. traditional presidencies have failed to bring meaningful change to the ways of washington, and the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy, a white house spokesman, harrison fields, said in response to questions about trumps retribution efforts and whether they represent an abuse of power. utilizing every tool afforded by the constitution, the trump administration is prioritizing efficiency eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and fulfilling every campaign promise. the ferocity and the scope during his first term, trumps instincts for revenge were sometimes thwarted by his own appointees, many of whom were experienced government hands or establishment republicans. by contrast, trump has filled his second-term administration with steadfast loyalists more likely to back his directives than caution against them. meanwhile, the republican majority in congress has shown little interest in opposing his actions. trump has taken steps as well to eliminate internal watchdogs who might seek to constrain him, purging inspectors general and firing government ethics officials. all administrations, particularly when you see a switch from one party to another, seek to control the executive branch, said historian timothy naftali, the former director of the richard nixon presidential library and museum. its the ferocity and the scope of what hes done that makes it unprecedented. the republican nixon famously had a list of enemies, but he plotted against them in secret. his most aggressive ideas, such as using the tax-collecting internal revenue service to audit his foes, were often blocked by his own officials. other presidents have used their power to penalize rivals in more muted ways, suri said. democrat lyndon johnson sought to discredit his political rival, robert kennedy, in the news media, and republican george w. bush banned brent scowcroft, a former national security adviser, from the white house after scowcroft wrote a column opposing the iraq war. thats often how presidents use their power to go after enemies they keep them out of their administration and spread rumors about them, suri said. trump has frequently intertwined his personal animus against political opponents with his administrations ideological and policy objectives. in february, trump digressed from remarks during a white house meeting with governors to address maine governor janet mills, warning her to comply with an order banning transgender athletes. see you in court, mills, a democrat, replied defiantly. within a day, three separate federal departments had initiated inquiries into whether the state was violating civil rights law, imperiling millions of dollars in federal funding. the justice department sent mills a letter telling her maine was on notice while trump demanded a full-throated apology before the case can be settled. in early april, trumps agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, wrote mills to confirm that some school funding had been frozen. this is only the beginning, rollins warned her. nine days later, the education department said it was taking steps to cut off all federal school funding to the state, and last week attorney general pam bondi announced the justice department had sued maine in federal court. in recent weeks, trump has attacked law firms that once employed attorneys he views as enemies, arguing they undermined the judicial process by doing so. in february, he suspended security clearances for attorneys at the law firm covington burling who had represented smith, the former special counsel investigating him, and sought to cancel any government work the firm had. making little effort to hide his primary motivation, trump suggested sending the pen he used to sign the order to smith as a souvenir. trump has signed executive orders targeting five other law firms, in each case indicating that revenge was an essential factor. his order punishing wilmerhale, for instance, noted that it once employed robert mueller, who investigated whether trumps 2016 campaign had improper connections with russia. nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work on mutually agreed projects backed by the administration. in some cases, trump simply appears determined to get even with former members of his 2017-2021 administration who irked him. this month, the president ordered the justice department to investigate christopher krebs, his former cybersecurity chief who disputed trumps false claims about election fraud in 2020, and miles taylor, a former homeland security official who anonymously wrote a 2019 book critical of trump. signing the executive order targeting the two former officials, trump called taylor a traitor. i think hes guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth, but well find out, he said. dissent isnt unlawful, taylor responded on x. it certainly isnt treasonous. reporting by

  Title: 'TREASON'...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-10 20:10:38)
  Content: president donald trump on wednesday signed sweeping presidential memorandums targeting two former government officials who opposed his actions in his first term his latest effort to use the powers of the presidency to punish people and institutions who have challenged him. in the oval office, trump directed the justice department to investigate former cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency director chris krebs and miles taylor, a former homeland security official. taylor penned an anonymous 2018 new york times op-ed titled i am part of the resistance inside the trump administration and an anonymous 2019 book that chronicled his observations and concerns during trumps first term in office. he revealed his authorship in 2020 and publicly campaigned against trumps reelection. trump also revoked security clearances for krebs, taylor and any entities associated with them, including the university of pennsylvania and the cybersecurity firm sentinelone. i said this would happen, taylor wrote on social media wednesday evening. dissent isnt unlawful. it certainly isnt treasonous. america is headed down a dark path. never has a man so inelegantly proved another mans point. krebs did not respond to requests for comment. sentinelone vice president craig vercolen told the washington post that the company would cooperate with any government inquiry and that fewer than 10 employees had security clearances. we do not expect this to materially impact our business in any way, he said. while signing the memorandums, trump reasserted his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen, claiming without evidence that more and more fraud is reported every day. trump fired krebs in november 2020, after the cybersecurity officials agency issued a statement calling the election the most secure in american history. krebs used similar words to describe the election shortly after his firing in a december 2020 op-ed he wrote for the post. the election should be celebrated by all americans, not undermined in the service of a profoundly un-american goal, he said at the time. that month, he also sued trumps campaign and one of its lawyers for defamation. in the oval office on wednesday, trump repeated his unfounded assertions. well find out whether or not it was a safe election, he said. and if it wasnt, hes got a big price to pay, he added, referring to krebs. matt blaze, a longtime election security expert, was one of 59 election security specialists who signed a joint statement rejecting the notion of computer fraud in the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. in a social media post wednesday, he said u.s. election infrastructure isnt perfect and theres still work to do to make it more secure. but there is simply no credible evidence that the 2020 election outcome was altered through technical attacks, despite exhaustive scrutiny. sen. angus king jr. i-maine, one of several chairs of the cyberspace solarium commission that was tasked with formulating a strategy to defend the united states against cyberattacks, denounced trumps targeting of krebs as a terrible misuse of the presidents authority. chris krebs crime appears to be telling the truth, in saying the 2020 elections infrastructure was secure and it was, he said in a statement. to take an action like this, which appears to be straight-up vengeance, is dangerous because of the message it sends to anyone in the federal government that tells the truth that youll lose your clearance, be slandered by the president, and investigated. trump has made similar moves targeting law firms that worked on litigation against him. in march, federal judges temporarily blocked parts of his executive orders sanctioning two of the firms he has tried to punish. last week, more than 500 law firms denounced his actions in a court filing, calling it an abuse of power that endangers the rule of law. cat zakrzewski, joseph menn and ben pauker contributed to this report.

  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-22 10:06:09)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article illustrates a Realist perspective on international relations applied domestically. Trump's actions, such as targeting perceived enemies and prioritizing national interests as he defines them, reflect a power-centric approach. The text states, "trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies." This demonstrates a focus on consolidating and exercising power, a core tenet of Realism.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Trump's use of executive orders to target perceived enemies, stating, "trump has made particular use of executive orders...to target perceived foes." This is intriguing because executive orders are typically used to direct policy priorities. Could this suggest a blurring of the lines between policy and personal vendettas, potentially undermining the legitimacy of the executive branch?

  Content: by joseph ax reuters -hours after swearing an oath to defend the u.s. constitution on january 20, president donald trump signed an executive order directing his attorney general to scour the justice department and other agencies for evidence of political weaponization. the same day, pentagon staff took down a portrait of mark milley, a trump critic who as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been the highest-ranking military officer during trumps first term. that evening, trump stripped his former national security adviser, john bolton - who wrote a memoir critical of trump - of the protective secret service detail he had been given after the justice department said iran had threatened boltons life. in his first 100 days, trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies. these include former intelligence officials who investigated alleged russian ties to his 2016 election campaign and major law firms as well as former biden administration members and prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against him while he was out of power. trumps actions served notice that his campaign promise of political retribution was anything but rhetorical, after he repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate. but the speed and sweep of his actions have caught many by surprise, with even the smallest slights drawing reprisals. the republican president has used the machinery of the state and the power of the presidency to go after people and institutions that have aggrieved him in more expansive ways than any of his predecessors, historians said. its not unusual for presidents to have enemies, said jeremi suri, a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin. what is unusual is for the president to use the entirety of the federal government, not simply to exclude someone, but to directly punish them. trump has made particular use of executive orders - typically used by presidents to direct policy priorities - to target perceived foes by stripping them of security clearances, blocking them from government buildings or directing agencies to probe them for wrongdoing. he has launched multiple federal probes into maine after a verbal spat with the states governor, reached deep into the traditionally independent justice department to fire those he views as disloyal, pulled protective security details from his critics and ordered investigations into former officials who challenged his false claims that his 2020 election loss was rigged. on his first day in office, he removed clearances for 50 former national security officials who had signed a letter suggesting russia was behind a story about salacious material found on a laptop belonging to president joe bidens son hunter. no evidence of russian involvement has emerged. he has also taken away clearances for all three democrats who ran against him in presidential contests biden, hillary clinton and kamala harris. trump has focused much of his attention on the criminal justice system after claiming during his 2024 presidential campaign that his four indictments were motivated by politics. then-president joe bidens administration denied the accusations. in trumps first 100 days, his justice department has fired or demoted dozens of officials, prosecutors and fbi agents, including rank-and-file employees who worked on investigations into trump and the january 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob of trump supporters. in a speech at the justice departments headquarters in february, trump denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him with illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. traditional presidencies have failed to bring meaningful change to the ways of washington, and the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy, a white house spokesman, harrison fields, said in response to questions about trumps retribution efforts and whether they represent an abuse of power. utilizing every tool afforded by the constitution, the trump administration is prioritizing efficiency eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and fulfilling every campaign promise. the ferocity and the scope during his first term, trumps instincts for revenge were sometimes thwarted by his own appointees, many of whom were experienced government hands or establishment republicans. by contrast, trump has filled his second-term administration with steadfast loyalists more likely to back his directives than caution against them. meanwhile, the republican majority in congress has shown little interest in opposing his actions. trump has taken steps as well to eliminate internal watchdogs who might seek to constrain him, purging inspectors general and firing government ethics officials. all administrations, particularly when you see a switch from one party to another, seek to control the executive branch, said historian timothy naftali, the former director of the richard nixon presidential library and museum. its the ferocity and the scope of what hes done that makes it unprecedented. the republican nixon famously had a list of enemies, but he plotted against them in secret. his most aggressive ideas, such as using the tax-collecting internal revenue service to audit his foes, were often blocked by his own officials. other presidents have used their power to penalize rivals in more muted ways, suri said. democrat lyndon johnson sought to discredit his political rival, robert kennedy, in the news media, and republican george w. bush banned brent scowcroft, a former national security adviser, from the white house after scowcroft wrote a column opposing the iraq war. thats often how presidents use their power to go after enemies they keep them out of their administration and spread rumors about them, suri said. only the beginning trump has frequently intertwined his personal animus against political opponents with his administrations ideological and policy objectives. in february, trump digressed from remarks during a white house meeting with governors to address maine governor janet mills, warning her to comply with an order banning transgender athletes. see you in court, mills, a democrat, replied defiantly. within a day, three separate federal departments had initiated inquiries into whether the state was violating civil rights law, imperiling millions of dollars in federal funding. the justice department sent mills a letter telling her maine was on notice while trump demanded a full-throated apology before the case can be settled. in early april, trumps agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, wrote mills to confirm that some school funding had been frozen. this is only the beginning, rollins warned her. nine days later, the education department said it was taking steps to cut off all federal school funding to the state, and last week attorney general pam bondi announced the justice department had sued maine in federal court. in recent weeks, trump has attacked law firms that once employed attorneys he views as enemies, arguing they undermined the judicial process by doing so. in february, he suspended security clearances for attorneys at the law firm covington burling who had represented smith, the former special counsel investigating him, and sought to cancel any government work the firm had. making little effort to hide his primary motivation, trump suggested sending the pen he used to sign the order to smith as a souvenir. trump has signed executive orders targeting five other law firms, in each case indicating that revenge was an essential factor. his order punishing wilmerhale, for instance, noted that it once employed robert mueller, who investigated whether trumps 2016 campaign had improper connections with russia. nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work on mutually agreed projects backed by the administration. in some cases, trump simply appears determined to get even with former members of his 2017-2021 administration who irked him. this month, the president ordered the justice department to investigate christopher krebs, his former cybersecurity chief who disputed trumps false claims about election fraud in 2020, and miles taylor, a former homeland security official who anonymously wrote a 2019 book critical of trump. signing the executive order targeting the two former officials, trump called taylor a traitor. i think hes guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth, but well find out, he said. dissent isnt unlawful, taylor responded on x. it certainly isnt treasonous. reporting by joseph ax editing by ross colvin and howard goller 2025 thomson reuters.

  Title: F.B.I. Leaders Push to Restore Trust in the Agency They Once Undermined
  Source: www.nytimes.com (2025-04-04 12:33:27)
  Content: before they took control of the f.b.i., the bureaus two top leaders, kash patel and dan bongino, were some of the agencys most rabid critics, attacking it at every turn for years. but now that they are running the agency, the two men have pulled a kind of bait-and-switch in recent emails to thousands of f.b.i. employees, they have sought to use the bureaus damaged reputation a reputation that they themselves helped tear down as a rationale for bringing reforms to the supposedly broken organization. over the past few years, the f.b.i.s reputation has been damaged in the eyes of our employers, the american people, mr. patel wrote on wednesday in one of the messages. i know each of you, serving across this great nation, are tackling cases that will further the betterment of the communities in which you live and work. times of change can be uneasy, but they are necessary, he went on. business as usual is no longer business as usual. absent from mr. patels communications with his 38,000 employees was any mention of the persistent assaults that he himself has launched against the f.b.i. over the years. before he ascended to the post of f.b.i. director, mr. patel repeatedly distorted the facts about the bureaus investigation of russian meddling into president trumps 2016 campaign. he has also been a central purveyor of conspiracy theories, accusing federal agents of having helped instigate the attack by mr. trumps supporters on the capitol on jan. 6, 2021. this tactic of officials campaigning to restore trust in public institutions that they themselves helped to damage has been used before by mr. trump and his allies. after mr. trump lost the 2020 election, he and his supporters promoted widespread lies that the race was marred by fraud, only to use their own false statements as a basis for their efforts to overturn the vote count. mr. patels email described what many f.b.i. agents believed they have been doing all along, even before he took control of the bureau investigating possible violations of federal laws. and they say that nothing has changed since mr. patel took the helm, though they are deeply worried about the current leadership and whether the bureau will tackle cases that could lead to a clash with the white house. in offering agents extensive praise for the work that they were already doing, the email also seemed like a tacit acknowledgment that mr. patel was trying to do more to win the trust and loyalty of his skeptical subordinates. the message came only days after mr. bongino wrote a similar letter to the f.b.i. staff on monday, saying he would set aside any personal politics and he would not act as a partisan political figure. mr. bonginos comments were an attempt to distance himself from the endless broadsides he made against democrats as a popular podcaster. luke william hunt, a professor at the university of alabama and a former f.b.i. agent who testified wednesday before a congressional subcommittee examining the bureau, said mr. bonginos comments were a stretch of the imagination. disregard everything i said, mr. hunt said. i am now a straight shooter. thats laughable. it would be foolish or naïve to believe a statement like that. youre asking an f.b.i. agent, who looks at the evidence, to believe that everything that is on print or on video is not representative of who they are. it remains unclear, even 30 days after mr. patel arrived at the f.b.i. what sorts of changes he intends to carry out. he has moved senior executives into new jobs and current and former agents applauded some of those choices. but some of those moves appear at odds with mr. patels past derision of the f.b.i.s aggressive approach to jan. 6. the new assistant director mr. patel named to run the washington field office, steven j. jensen, was in charge of the bureaus domestic terrorism operations section on that day, and he played a key role in responding to the attack on the capitol. mr. jensen was also responsible for establishing a system to monitor incidents of violence at school board meetings across the country as potential acts of domestic terrorism one of the most serious complaints that mr. patel himself had about the f.b.i. under the biden administration.in his 2023 book, government gangsters, mr. patel wrote that the justice department targeted parents who pushed back against programs to teach their children vile and hateful race theory. the department, mr. patel said, justified its threatening campaign against parents in a memo that labeled these law-abiding citizens as domestic terrorists. mr. patels email reminisces about the f.b.i. that he fell in love with but now had lost its way. he riffs on special agents who without fear or favor, pushed through whatever roadblocks to secure righteous investigations of those who had abused the public trust and treasure. the previous director, christopher a. wray, who stepped down before mr. trump could fire him, said exactly the same thing as mr. patel. during his seven years running the agency, he urged agents to conduct investigations the right way, every time. it means conducting investigations without fear or favor, and it means not pursuing investigations when the proper predication is not there, mr. wray said in december when he announced he was leaving. in his email, mr. patel laments that special agents whose word was beyond reproach whose cases, that as prosecutor, i knew had meticulously met and documented proof of the elements of the crimes. the assertion is notable given the criticism mr. patel has leveled at the bureau over its search of mr. trumps mar-a-lago estate after he left office. he suggested in his book there was no reason to do so and accused the judge who approved the search warrant of being biased. the mar-a-lago raid makes watergate look like the teacup ride at disney world, he wrote. but f.b.i. agents and prosecutors obtained a court-approved search warrant because mr. trump repeatedly refused to comply with the governments requests to return they documents that officials said were classified. all along trump allies of the f.b.i. have complained that the jan. 6 defendants were denied due process in hundreds of court cases, casting them as political prisoners. in reality, they were allowed to fight their charges in the same way as all criminal defendants do but did not like the outcome. indeed, one of mr. patels favorite targets was the f.b.i.s russia investigation known as crossfire hurricane that scrutinized whether any trump associates had conspired with russia during the 2016 campaign. serious mistakes were made in that investigation, and agents were disciplined for botching applications to secretly obtain a surveillance warrant. but the justice departments inspector general found that its agents had good reason to open crossfire hurricane. a lengthy investigation by a special counsel appointed under mr. trump, john h. durham, accused the f.b.i. of confirmation bias. still, in his final report, mr. durham said that as an initial matter, there is no question that the f.b.i. had an affirmative obligation to closely examine the tip that prompted the investigation. mr. durham charged no high-level f.b.i. or intelligence official with a crime and acknowledged in a footnote that hillary clintons 2016 presidential campaign also did nothing prosecutable. mr. hunt acknowledged that the agency was not a perfect institution but emphasized the role conservative critics had played in undermining the bureau. but all of those investigations that the right has wanted to make a big deal about are based on proper predications by that i mean there were specific and articulable facts that justified investigating those matters.

  Title: Trump seeks court approval for most aggressive union-busting attempt ever
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-04 10:00:25)
  Content: now we may know why president donald trump has not reissued his three first-term, anti-union directives that sharply reduced the ability of labor leaders to represent employees. rather than hamstring federal labor organizations, trump wants to bust the unions. in another move among many to vastly expand the power of the presidency, trump issued an executive order last week that is the most aggressive attack on collective bargaining the nation has ever seen. if the action withstands judicial challenges, it will cancel legally binding union contracts covering a large swath of federal employees in many agencies that would no longer recognize union representation. trumps order would eliminate collective bargaining agreements in about three dozen agencies across the government. although he claims this is necessary under his disputably broad definition of national security, some of the agencies have little to do with that issue. and, employees at intelligence and national security agencies such as the fbi and cia already are not allowed to unionize. notably, the american academy of diplomacy, a nonpartisan organization of national security professionals and retired u.s. ambassadors, strongly opposes the order. attempting to politicize a professional workforce that has been a faithful and nonpartisan partner of our elected leadership for over 100 years since the establishment of the foreign service, its statement said, is a profound mistake. the american federation of government employees afge estimated trumps order affects 1 million feds. a statement from the national treasury employees union nteu, which filed a lawsuit against the governments move, said trump would eliminate union rights for two-thirds of the entire federal workforce, which totals about 2.3 million civilian workers. it is by far the largest single action of union-busting in american history, said joseph a. mccartin, a georgetown university history professor and president of the labor and working-class history association. trumps current aggression against federal unions goes well beyond his may 2018 benchmark of three executive orders. they were revoked by president joe biden, but not before the directives impeded federal grievance procedures, quickened the firing process, expelled labor leaders from agency-provided office space, and severely cut their government-paid official time when representing unions in agency matters. this years order reflects a trump administration that is much better prepared than his first for a more thorough, systematic and deeper attack on organized labor and the government generally. a key part of this is his justice departments brazen ploy for a potentially friendly jurist to preemptively affirm the directive, even before a court challenge was lodged against it. despite the white houses earlier criticism of forum-shopping, justice asked a waco, texas, federal court to confirm trumps power to kill union contracts. the waco court has just one district judge, chosen by trump, leaving no doubt who will hear the case. the doj filed a similar preemptive action against the nteu in kentucky. the department and the white house did not respond to questions about the executive order or court venues. federal law allows presidents to exclude agencies from collective bargaining if their primary function is investigative or national security work. trumps order appears illegitimate on its face for certain agencies, said debra dagostino, a federal practice group law firm partner. while this makes sense for national security agencies, she said, it gets ridiculous when applied to organizations like the department of health and human services and the department of veterans affairs. the nteus lawsuit argues that when passing the law, congresss explicit finding was, quoting the law, the statutory protection of the right of employees to organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations of their own choosing in decisions which affect them safeguards the public interest. the american foreign service association also condemned the directive. trumps order does not mention the department of housing and urban development, but, curiously, the dojs legal brief cites hud among the agencies included. the justification for excluding hud from collective bargaining, according to justice, is hud uses computers and cybersecurity is national security because foreign adversaries are constantly seeking to penetrate agency computer systems. that claim could apply to every government office, no matter the function. beyond any national security arguments, central to the order is trumps intention to emasculate union power. collective bargaining agreements cbas, justice argued, give hostile unions powerful tools to prevent changes to agency operations they oppose, adding that the union contracts prevent agencies from adopting personnel policies that align with the presidents priorities. the dojs brief said the court should declare agencies do have the power and authority under the executive order to rescind or repudiate their labor contracts. and once repudiation is accomplished, the filing continued, agencies will no longer be bound by the terms of the cbas agencies will no longer have a duty to engage in collective bargaining with certain of their employees, and unions can no longer represent the employees in collective bargaining. unions are doing their jobs by opposing the brutal way trump has been dumping federal employees, placing thousands on leave with little or no notice, locking them out of offices and closing some agencies without congressional approval. justice acknowledges that under current law, agencies could not implement unilateral changes without seeking preclearance from union representatives. but rather than seek legislation to change the law, the trump administration is going to great lengths to defy legal contracts. filing its case for approval of trumps defiance in waco means the case against the afge, the largest federal union, will be heard by his judicial pick, judge alan albright, more than 1,200 miles from washington, where both the agencies and the union are headquartered. albright drew national attention in a 2021 court-shopping controversy because of the unusually large number of patent cases that came before him. the dojs court action is incredibly aggressive, especially given that the suit is not in fact alleging that the unions have violated any laws, said michelle bercovici, a federal employment partner with the alden law group. it appears to me that the administration is blatantly engaging in forum shopping by filing this appeal in a small, conservative district court with a sole trump-appointed federal judge. not all conservatives agree with trumps actions. in a rare display of gop pushback against him, a letter from eight republican house members urged trump to reconsider his directive and restore collective bargaining in agencies where it would not genuinely impair national security interests.

  Title: Top Democrats Protest After Reported Firing of National Security Agency Director
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-04 03:42:02)
  Content: washington ap president donald trump has abruptly fired the director of the national security agency, according to u.s. officials and members of congress, but the white house and the pentagon have provided no reasons for the move. senior military leaders were informed thursday of the firing of air force gen. tim haugh, who also oversaw the pentagons cyber command, the officials said. they received no advance notice about the decision to remove a four-star general with a 33-year career in intelligence and cyber operations, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel decisions. the move has triggered sharp criticism from members of congress. and it marks the latest dismissal of national security officials by trump at a time when his republican administration faces criticism over his failure to take any action against other key leaders use of an unclassified signal messaging chat that included the atlantic editor-in-chief jeffrey goldberg to discuss plans for a military strike. its unclear who now is in charge of the nsa and the cyber command. also fired was haughs civilian deputy at the nsa, wendy noble. the nsa notified congressional leadership and top lawmakers of the national security committees of the firing late wednesday but did not give reasons, according to a person familiar with the situation who insisted on anonymity to discuss the matter. the person said noble has been reassigned to the office of the defense undersecretary for intelligence. the white house did not respond to messages seeking comment. the nsa referred questions about haugh to the defense department, which had no comment friday. far-right activist and commentator laura loomer appeared to take credit friday in a post on x, saying she raised concerns to trump about haughs ties to gen. mark milley and the biden administration and questioned the nsa chiefs loyalty to the president. milley served as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff during trumps first term but has since become an outspoken critic. given the fact that the nsa is arguably the most powerful intel agency in the world, we cannot allow for a biden nominee to hold that position, loomer wrote. thank you president trump for being receptive to the vetting materials provided to you and thank you for firing these biden holdovers. loomer, who has claimed the sept. 11, 2001, attacks were an inside job, had discussed staff loyalty with trump in an oval office meeting wednesday, according to several people familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive personnel manner. a day later, trump said he fired some white house national security council officials. sen. jack reed, a democrat from rhode island, said friday that he has long warned about the dangers of firing military officers as a political loyalty test. in addition to the other military leaders and national security officials trump has fired, he is sending a chilling message throughout the ranks dont give your best military advice, or you may face consequences, reed said in a statement. he added that trump has given a priceless gift to china, russia, iran, and north korea by purging competence from our national security leadership. another democrat, sen. mark warner of virginia, vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee, said the u.s. was facing unprecedented cyber threats and asked how firing haugh, who has served in the military for more than 30 years, makes american safer. haughs firing sets off a 60-day process. unless he is moved to another three- or four-star job in 60 days he would automatically revert to a two-star. any new high-level job would be unlikely since that would require a nomination from trump, who just fired him. as a result, haugh, who was confirmed for the nsa job in a unanimous senate vote in december 2023, would likely retire. trump hasnt commented on haugh or noble, but on thursday he dismissed the national security council firings as normal. always were letting go of people, trump told reporters aboard air force one as he made his way to miami on thursday afternoon. people that we dont like or people that we dont think can do the job or people that may have loyalties to somebody else. the firings come as trumps national security adviser, mike waltz, fights calls for his ouster after using the publicly available encrypted signal app to discuss planning for a sensitive march 15 military operation targeting houthi militants in yemen. warner called it astonishing that trump would fire the nonpartisan, experienced leader of the national security agency while still failing to hold any member of his team accountable for leaking classified information on a commercial messaging app even as he apparently takes staffing direction on national security from a discredited conspiracy theorist in the oval office. haugh met last month with elon musk, whose department of government efficiency has roiled the federal government by slashing personnel and budgets at dozens of agencies. in a statement, the nsa said the meeting was intended to ensure both organizations are aligned with the new administrations priorities. haugh had led both the nsa and cyber command since 2023. both departments play leading roles in the nations cybersecurity. the nsa also supports the military and other national security agencies by collecting and analyzing a vast amount of data and information globally. cyber command is known as americas first line of defense in cyberspace and also plans offensive cyberoperations for potential use against adversaries. ___ associated press writers matthew lee, aamer madhani, zeke miller, david klepper

  Title: North Korea, Iran, Russia-Backed Hackers Deploy ClickFix in New Attacks
  Source: hackread.com (2025-04-21 12:49:54)
  Content: government-backed hacking groups from north korea ta427, iran ta450, and russia unk_remoterogue, ta422 are now using the clickfix technique in their espionage campaigns. learn about proofpoints insights into this new wave of attacks. proofpoint has recently discovered a concerning development related to the clickfix attack, a dangerous social engineering method. reportedly, government-backed hacking groups are now using this technique, exploiting users trust by presenting fake error messages or security alerts from the operating system or familiar applications. users are tricked into downloading and running a code in their computers command line interface, believing it is a solution to their problem. however, when run, this code executes malicious commands on the victims machine. last year, hackread.com raised an alarm about the rising popularity of the clickfix attack among cybercriminals starting in march 2024, after groups like ta571 and clearfake used it. in october 2024, sekoia observed a rise in clickfix attacks involving fake google meet, chrome, and facebook pages tricking users into downloading malware. the latest wave of clickfix attacks was observed between july 2024 and early 2025, with north korea, iran, and russia-backed hackers incorporating clickfix into their usual operations. attacks timeline source proofpoint north korea ta427 in early 2025, ta427 kimsuky, emerald sleet targeted individuals from 5 organisations in the think tank sector working on north korea affairs. they used deceptive meeting requests and fake websites to trick them into running powershell commands. one successful attack involved impersonating a japanese diplomat ambassador shigeo yamada and led to the installation of quasarrat malware. malicious email source proofpoint iran ta450 in november 2024, ta450 muddywater, mango sandstorm targeted 39 organisations, mainly finance and government sectors, in the middle east with fake microsoft security update emails. they used clickfix to persuade users to run powershell commands that installed the level rmm tool, which the attackers intended to use for espionage and data theft. no further use of clickfix by this group was observed afterwards. russia unk_remoterogue and ta422 unk_remoterogue used clickfix once in december 2024, targeting individuals in two prominent arms manufacturing firms in the defence industry, sending emails with a link to a fake microsoft office page with russian instructions to copypaste code that executed javascript and then powershell linked to the empire framework. ta422 sofacy, apt28 employed clickfix in october 2024, targeting ukrainian entities, sending phishing emails with a link mimicking a google spreadsheet sent out by cert-ua that led to a recaptcha, which, upon clicking, provided a powershell command to create an ssh tunnel and run metasploit. these groups, however, are not completely changing their attack methods. instead, they are using clickfix to replace certain steps in how they initially infect a targets computer and run malicious software. also, according to proofpoints blog post, they have not observed any chinese government-backed groups using clickfix, possibly due to limited visibility into their activities. even though clickfix is not yet a standard tool for state-sponsored actors, its increasing popularity suggests that this technique could become more common in government-backed cyber espionage campaigns in the coming months, researchers conclude.

* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
