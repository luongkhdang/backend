  Title: Police seize enough fentanyl ‘to kill everyone in Portland twice,’ arrest 46 in multi-agency trafficking crackdown
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-22 23:31:33)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article highlights a state-level response (law enforcement agencies) to a perceived threat (fentanyl trafficking) originating from a non-state actor (Sinaloa Cartel) across international borders. This aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize security and power in an anarchic international system. The quote 'our partnership with local, state, and federal agencies makes our collective response stronger' exemplifies the state's attempt to consolidate power to address the threat.; Intriguing_angles: The article emphasizes the success of the operation and the collaboration between agencies, but it doesn't delve into the root causes of the drug crisis or the social factors contributing to drug use and trafficking. This omission could be a deliberate choice to focus on the immediate law enforcement response rather than addressing the more complex underlying issues. What are the long-term strategies to address the root causes of drug trafficking and addiction in Portland?

  Content: portland, ore. koin a series of drug trafficking missions conducted in the portland area earlier this year and involving multiple law enforcement agencies yielded 46 arrests and dozens of pounds of illicit drugs seized, authorities said. the missions focused on fentanyl trafficking and were conducted in the month of february. the multi-agency effort involved law enforcement entities on the local, state and federal levels. the crackdown is in response to fentanyl flooding into the pacific northwest from the honduran-based sinaloa cartel, according to the portland police bureau. amr just short of countys compliance standards there was also 204,007 in cash seized, as well as 20 guns, 44 pounds of fentanyl powder and 2,507 fentanyl pills. the illicit drugs seized during the operation which also included 22 pounds of methamphetamine, nine pounds of cocaine and two pounds of heroin was located in part thanks to the use of a k9 police dog. drugs seized. april 22, 2025 courtesy portland police bureau. drugs seized. april 22, 2025 courtesy portland police bureau. drugs seized. april 22, 2025 courtesy portland police bureau. firearm seized. april 22, 2025 courtesy portland police bureau. k9 and drugs seized. april 22, 2025 courtesy portland police bureau. fentanyl has no place in our city. our partnership with local, state, and federal agencies makes our collective response stronger, portland police chief bob day said in a statement. this operation was a success, but it is only one step in a larger, sustained effort to keep portland safe. david f. reames, a special agent with the drug enforcement agency seattle field division, said the amount of fentanyl seized by his team and the other participating agencies could have yielded over 1.5 million lethal doses or enough to kill everyone in portland twice. nearly all of those arrested selling drugs were illegally present in the united states, reames said. these same traffickers had been exploiting children by using them to sell dangerous drugs. the case today highlights our collective success in bringing some accountability to the criminals who sell poison on our streets. in addition to the ppb and the dea, other agencies involved in the recent fentanyl trafficking missions included the federal bureau of investigation, the multnomah county sheriffs office, the multnomah county district attorneys office and the u.s. attorneys office. also assisting in the operation was a special team as part of the high intensity drug trafficking area program, whose participating agencies include the oregon state police and homeland security investigations, among others. ppb chief bob day said collaboration is essential when the challenge of fighting the drug crisis is this big. it makes me proud when i can see us come together across jurisdiction, across federal and state and county boundaries, and find a way to be successful to enhance the safety and security for all portlanders, he said. and thats what these results demonstrate. 2025 nexstar media, inc. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. for the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to koin.com.

  Title: 100 DAYS OF PUNISHING FOES...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article demonstrates how Trump actively shapes the public's perception by prioritizing certain narratives (e.g., 'political weaponization,' 'lies and abuses') and repeatedly emphasizing them. The text states Trump 'repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate' and 'denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him.' This constant reinforcement influences which issues voters deem important, potentially overshadowing other concerns.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the speed and scope of Trump's actions, noting that 'even the smallest slights drawing reprisals.' This suggests a potential underlying mechanism of personal vendettas driving policy decisions, raising questions about the stability and predictability of the administration's actions. What are the long-term consequences of such personalized governance?; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work.' This raises questions about the ethical implications of such arrangements and whether they constitute a form of extortion or coercion. Does this set a dangerous precedent for future interactions between the government and private entities?

      (No specific snippets retrieved for this entity in this article)
  Content: reuters -hours after swearing an oath to defend the u.s. constitution on january 20, president donald trump signed an executive order directing his attorney general to scour the justice department and other agencies for evidence of political weaponization. the same day, pentagon staff took down a portrait of mark milley, a trump critic who as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been the highest-ranking military officer during trumps first term. that evening, trump stripped his former national security adviser, john bolton - who wrote a memoir critical of trump - of the protective secret service detail he had been given after the justice department said iran had threatened boltons life. in his first 100 days, trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies. these include former intelligence officials who investigated alleged russian ties to his 2016 election campaign and major law firms as well as former biden administration members and prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against him while he was out of power. trumps actions served notice that his campaign promise of political retribution was anything but rhetorical, after he repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate. but the speed and sweep of his actions have caught many by surprise, with even the smallest slights drawing reprisals. the republican president has used the machinery of the state and the power of the presidency to go after people and institutions that have aggrieved him in more expansive ways than any of his predecessors, historians said. its not unusual for presidents to have enemies, said jeremi suri, a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin. what is unusual is for the president to use the entirety of the federal government, not simply to exclude someone, but to directly punish them. trump has made particular use of executive orders - typically used by presidents to direct policy priorities - to target perceived foes by stripping them of security clearances, blocking them from government buildings or directing agencies to probe them for wrongdoing. he has launched multiple federal probes into maine after a verbal spat with the states governor, reached deep into the traditionally independent justice department to fire those he views as disloyal, pulled protective security details from his critics and ordered investigations into former officials who challenged his false claims that his 2020 election loss was rigged. on his first day in office, he removed clearances for 50 former national security officials who had signed a letter suggesting russia was behind a story about salacious material found on a laptop belonging to president joe bidens son hunter. no evidence of russian involvement has emerged. he has also taken away clearances for all three democrats who ran against him in presidential contests biden, hillary clinton and kamala harris. trump has focused much of his attention on the criminal justice system after claiming during his 2024 presidential campaign that his four indictments were motivated by politics. then-president joe bidens administration denied the accusations. in trumps first 100 days, his justice department has fired or demoted dozens of officials, prosecutors and fbi agents, including rank-and-file employees who worked on investigations into trump and the january 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob of trump supporters. in a speech at the justice departments headquarters in february, trump denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him with illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. traditional presidencies have failed to bring meaningful change to the ways of washington, and the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy, a white house spokesman, harrison fields, said in response to questions about trumps retribution efforts and whether they represent an abuse of power. utilizing every tool afforded by the constitution, the trump administration is prioritizing efficiency eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and fulfilling every campaign promise. the ferocity and the scope during his first term, trumps instincts for revenge were sometimes thwarted by his own appointees, many of whom were experienced government hands or establishment republicans. by contrast, trump has filled his second-term administration with steadfast loyalists more likely to back his directives than caution against them. meanwhile, the republican majority in congress has shown little interest in opposing his actions. trump has taken steps as well to eliminate internal watchdogs who might seek to constrain him, purging inspectors general and firing government ethics officials. all administrations, particularly when you see a switch from one party to another, seek to control the executive branch, said historian timothy naftali, the former director of the richard nixon presidential library and museum. its the ferocity and the scope of what hes done that makes it unprecedented. the republican nixon famously had a list of enemies, but he plotted against them in secret. his most aggressive ideas, such as using the tax-collecting internal revenue service to audit his foes, were often blocked by his own officials. other presidents have used their power to penalize rivals in more muted ways, suri said. democrat lyndon johnson sought to discredit his political rival, robert kennedy, in the news media, and republican george w. bush banned brent scowcroft, a former national security adviser, from the white house after scowcroft wrote a column opposing the iraq war. thats often how presidents use their power to go after enemies they keep them out of their administration and spread rumors about them, suri said. trump has frequently intertwined his personal animus against political opponents with his administrations ideological and policy objectives. in february, trump digressed from remarks during a white house meeting with governors to address maine governor janet mills, warning her to comply with an order banning transgender athletes. see you in court, mills, a democrat, replied defiantly. within a day, three separate federal departments had initiated inquiries into whether the state was violating civil rights law, imperiling millions of dollars in federal funding. the justice department sent mills a letter telling her maine was on notice while trump demanded a full-throated apology before the case can be settled. in early april, trumps agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, wrote mills to confirm that some school funding had been frozen. this is only the beginning, rollins warned her. nine days later, the education department said it was taking steps to cut off all federal school funding to the state, and last week attorney general pam bondi announced the justice department had sued maine in federal court. in recent weeks, trump has attacked law firms that once employed attorneys he views as enemies, arguing they undermined the judicial process by doing so. in february, he suspended security clearances for attorneys at the law firm covington burling who had represented smith, the former special counsel investigating him, and sought to cancel any government work the firm had. making little effort to hide his primary motivation, trump suggested sending the pen he used to sign the order to smith as a souvenir. trump has signed executive orders targeting five other law firms, in each case indicating that revenge was an essential factor. his order punishing wilmerhale, for instance, noted that it once employed robert mueller, who investigated whether trumps 2016 campaign had improper connections with russia. nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work on mutually agreed projects backed by the administration. in some cases, trump simply appears determined to get even with former members of his 2017-2021 administration who irked him. this month, the president ordered the justice department to investigate christopher krebs, his former cybersecurity chief who disputed trumps false claims about election fraud in 2020, and miles taylor, a former homeland security official who anonymously wrote a 2019 book critical of trump. signing the executive order targeting the two former officials, trump called taylor a traitor. i think hes guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth, but well find out, he said. dissent isnt unlawful, taylor responded on x. it certainly isnt treasonous. reporting by

  Title: Many 'snowbirds' in USA looking to pack up and fly north -- for good...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism is relevant here. The article illustrates how a shift in the U.S. administration's policies and rhetoric, specifically "steep trade tariffs" and "suggestions that canada should become a u.s. state," directly impacts Canada's economic and social well-being. This aligns with Realism's emphasis on states acting in their self-interest and the pursuit of power, leading to a competitive and sometimes conflictual international environment. The resulting "chill that has blanketed relations" and the economic consequences for both countries demonstrate the core tenets of Realist thought.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that some Canadians are "quietly preparing to let go of their second homes" but "holding back to see how things play out." This suggests a level of uncertainty and a potential for further shifts in behavior depending on future political developments. What specific political or economic indicators are these Canadians monitoring, and what threshold would trigger a more widespread exodus?; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the economic reliance of South Florida on Canadian snowbirds, stating they "either own property and pay property tax or rent for the winter months - either way, a boost to the economy." However, it doesn't quantify the overall economic impact or explore potential mitigation strategies. What percentage of South Florida's economy is directly attributable to Canadian snowbirds, and what alternative revenue streams are being considered to offset the potential loss?

      > Snippet: canadians spent close to 6 billion on u.s. real estate from april 2023 to march 2024 - making up 13 of all foreign transactions - more than any other nationality
  Content: by doyinsola oladipo and mrinalika roy reuters -the number of canadian snowbirds planning to sell their second homes in sunny florida and arizona has surged this spring, many of them put off by the sudden chill that has blanketed relations between their homeland and the u.s. real estate agents say they are seeing more canadians cashing out, further softening property prices in warm-weather states that have long attracted retirees and tourists from cold and snowy canada. canadians spent close to 6 billion on u.s. real estate from april 2023 to march 2024 - making up 13 of all foreign transactions - more than any other nationality, according to data from the national association of realtors. nearly half of the homes purchased by canadians were for vacation purposes, with florida, arizona and hawaii ranking as the top markets. last week, tracy and dale mcmullen sold their vacation home in buckeye, arizona, a property they owned for five years. the alberta residents, who usually spend four to five months in arizona a year, said they are not planning to come back. we decided to sell the property after the current potus took office, said dale, referring to u.s. president donald trump, who was inaugurated for the second time in january. it was time to leave. we felt we could not trust what he might do next to us as individuals and to our country. we no longer felt welcome nor safe. canadians are feeling stung by the actions and words of the trump administration, which has imposed steep trade tariffs on its northern neighbor, threatening canadas export-dependent economy. trumps repeated suggestions that canada should become a u.s. state, and his derogatory references to now-former prime minister justin trudeau as governor have annoyed canadians and offended their national pride. as a result, many canadians are boycotting u.s.-made goods, such as bourbon and produce and canceling trips to u.s. destinations. canadian return flights from the u.s. fell 13.5 in march from a year earlier, according to statistics canada. canadian-resident return trips by automobile fell about 32. real estate is now facing a similar pullback in demand. laurie lavine, a realtor in arizona who helped the mcmullens with their sale, told reuters that he currently has 18 listings from canadians looking to sell, compared with the usual two to four per quarter. trade friction and the current weakness of the canadian dollar are also contributing to the pullback, lavine said. canadians are also feeling picked on, with u.s. border agents enforcing stricter rules on entering the country, he added. beginning this month, the trump administration is requiring all foreigners 14 or older to register and submit fingerprints if they stay beyond 30 days. canadians, who previously could visit for up to six months without a visa, are subject to the new requirement. the sour feelings that many canadians suddenly feel toward the u.s. are having a big impact on the property market in florida, one of the closest warm-weather states to ontario and quebec, canadas most populous provinces. south floridas residential market has for decades been reliant on the annual influx of canadian snowbirds who either own property and pay property tax or rent for the winter months - either way, a boost to the economy, said ermengarde jabir, a director of economic research at moodys analytics. the first quarter is typically the peak buying season for condominiums in the region, coinciding with when many snowbirds are in town, said andrea hartmann, managing partner of the sandy hartmann group, a real estate firm in the tampa bay area. since the beginning of the year we have not received an offer from a canadian buyer even once, and normally we would, she said. floridas housing market is already reeling. prospective buyers have faced rising insurance premiums, concerns over climate change and a series of devastating hurricanes in recent years. in the tampa-st. petersburg-clearwater region, mortgage lock volume for second homes - or the number of buyers securing rates ahead of purchases - fell 25 on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2025, according to optimal blue, a mortgage technology and data company. now with the political issue, the cost of maintaining a place here in florida and the insurance, a lot of them decided to sell and go, said ken obrian, owner of southwest coast realty in naples, which has specialized in helping canadians purchase properties in florida for about 20 years. there is no incentive to come to the states anymore, said donny b., a native of ontario who is looking to sell his two investment properties in florida. like many snowbirds interviewed for this story, he declined to give his surname, saying he feared backlash. he said he decided to sell because of the political uncertainty, the exchange rate and concern about whether floridians would still welcome canadians in the current climate. i got down here on wednesday and i was nervous. im like, are people going to be pissed off at me? other states have started to see an exodus as well. agents in los angeles and palm springs, california, are working with canadian sellers who are quietly preparing to let go of their second homes, said fatima malik, global real estate advisor at engel volkers beverly hills. some are holding back to see how things play out, but others are already shifting their sights toward places like portugal, mexico, and parts of france, she added. reporting by doyinsola oladipo in new york and mrinalika roy in bengaluru editing by frank mcgurty and paul simao

  Title: Trump 2.0 is in a state of permanent emergency - CNN
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-09 21:33:00)
  Content: a version of this story appeared in cnns what matters newsletter. to get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. the emergency of the moment is the economy. president donald trump declared a national emergency to address a long-standing trade imbalance and declare a global trade war. after a week of market calamity and recession fears, trump blinked on the most severe new taxes, which his aides had recently promised were not a negotiating tactic but were meant to restore trade balance. instead, hell focus tariffs on china now set at 125 and give other countries 90 days to negotiate out of 10 blanket tariffs that remain in place. markets surged with relief. either the presidents economic team was bluffing when they promised the reciprocal tariffs were here to stay or the economic minds in the white house saw signs of an emerging real-time emergency a cratering bond market alongside a cratering stock market and realized a full-on economic implosion was possible. the economic emergency is just one of a galaxy of emergencies and emergency authorities trumps administration cites for his actions. earlier tariffs against canada and mexico were imposed, the president said, because of the flow of fentanyl, leading trump to declare emergencies at the us northern and southern borders. canadians have been angered by the idea that trump imposed tariffs due to the flow of drugs across the northern border because theres little evidence of much drug flow there. at the end of the day, what we know is the relationship between canada and the us will never be the same, canadas foreign minister mélanie joly told cnns jake tapper on tuesday. the military is playing a larger role at the southern border because of the national emergency trump declared there, saying that americas sovereignty is under attack. the language of invasion also plays into trumps invocation of the 18th-century alien enemies act, by which the administration deported some migrants without due process. the supreme court allowed the deportations to continue, but said this week that deportees must get a hearing. trump declared an emergency authority to supercharge energy production, particularly in the oil and gas industry, and get around environmental and wildlife protections on federal land. hes cited that emergency also to invoke wartime powers to supercharge mineral production in the us. separately, hes trying to move the us back toward reliance on coal and cited his energy emergency to reclassify coal as a mineral and make its production a matter of national security. coal is not, technically speaking, a mineral. he also cited the energy emergency to ask his secretary of energy to add more redundant which presumably means carbon-based energy sources to the energy grid. and it was by citing the energy emergency that trump forced california to open up dams and release billions of gallons of water that was not able to reach fires in los angeles and which farmers opposed. trump wants more logging in the us, so his administration has invoked emergency authority to boost lumber production in the us. the idea, again, is to sidestep some environmental protections to open 112 million acres of forestland and make it more difficult for conservation groups to object to logging. trump has complained that the us relies on lumber from canada. elizabeth goitein at the brennan center for justice at new york university has been warning for years about the overuse of emergency power by presidents. emergency powers are designed to let a president respond swiftly to sudden, unforeseen crises that congress cannot act quickly or flexibly enough to address, she wrote recently. emergency powers are not meant to solve long-standing problems, no matter how serious those problems may be. nor are they intended to give a president the ability to bypass congress and act as an all-powerful policymaker. but efforts to limit emergency power, perhaps by limiting it to 30 days instead of a year, have gone nowhere in congress. presidents frequently use them to impose sanctions. theres been an emergency declared with regard to iran since the 1970s, and ukraine for more than a decade, for instance. but trumps use of emergency authority to fiddle with the world economy, regulate immigration, police borders and end-run around environmental laws has been supercharged in his second term. trump cited a long-standing national emergency with regard to venezuela not simply to continue sanctions on the country, but also to apply tariffs to any country that does business with venezuela and to declare the tren de aragua criminal network a terrorist organization. congress has the power to rescind a presidents national emergency declaration. the house and senate both voted to rescind trumps first-term border emergency declaration, but could not override his veto. it would take a supermajority to undeclare an emergency. that means his mercurial on-and-off approach to imposing tariffs is here to stay. treasury secretary scott bessent said trumps u-turn wednesday was the plan all along. trump later said he calibrated his approach because people were getting yippy. anyone who has been watching politics for the past decade will wonder if organizing other countries against chinas export might was the goal, why did trump blow up the trans-pacific partnership during his first term? that multi-country trade deal was aimed at arresting chinas economic influence. trump blew it up, and the other countries involved carried on without the us. now, over the next 90 days, trump will engage in negotiations with countries the us could have been in a trade deal with for the past 10 years. hes also negotiating with canada and mexico, countries he signed a trade deal with during his first term. if the end goal of addressing the trade balance emergency were restoring manufacturing in the us, one could wonder why trump has turned against the chips act, the bipartisan law passed during the biden administration that intended to seed semiconductor manufacturing in the us.

  Title: A Senate vote to reverse Trump's tariffs on Canada tests Republican support
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-01 04:04:06)
  Content: washington ap with president donald trumps so-called liberation day of tariff implementation fast approaching, senate democrats are putting republican support for some of those plans to the test by forcing a vote to nullify the emergency declaration that underpins the tariffs on canada. republicans have watched with some unease as the presidents attempts to remake global trade have sent the stock market downward, but they have so far stood by trumps on-again-off-again threats to levy taxes on imported goods. even as the resolution from democratic sen. tim kaine of virginia offered them a potential off-ramp to the tariffs levied on canadian imports, republican leaders were trying to keep senators in line by focusing on fentanyl that comes into the u.s. over its northern border. it was yet another example of how trump is not only reorienting global economics, but upending his partys longtime support for ideas like free trade. i really relish giving my republican colleagues the chance to not just say theyre concerned, but actually take an action to stop these tariffs, kaine told the associated press in an interview last week. kaines resolution would end the emergency declaration that trump signed in february to implement tariffs on canada as punishment for not doing enough to halt the flow of illegal drugs into the u.s. if the senate passes the resolution, it would still need to be taken up by the republican-controlled house. a small fraction of the fentanyl that comes into the u.s. enters from canada. customs and border protection seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the northern border during the 2024 fiscal year, and since january, authorities have seized less than 1.5 pounds, according to federal data. meanwhile, at the southern border, authorities seized over 21,000 pounds last year. democrats warned that tariffs on canadian goods would ripple through the economy, making it more expensive to build homes, outfit military ships and pay for daily goods. these tariffs are a tax increase on american families plain and simple, said senate democratic leader chuck schumer of new york. he argued that the increased costs for american households were being done simply to give a tax cut to trumps billionaire friends. schumer said he agrees with taking on china which really has hurt us in trade every step of the way. but the tariffs dont make sense for an ally whose economy is so interconnected with the u.s. economy. he added the tariffs are creating uncertainty with businesses and consumers. at a news conference tuesday, kaine said fentanyl trafficking is an emergency, but that the emergency stems from china and mexico, not canada. he said trump invented a made-up emergency to help pay for extending tax cuts that he said primarily benefit the wealthy. how are they going to pay for it? massive cuts in programs like medicaid and medicare, and tariffs imposed on the backs of everyday americans, kaine said. still, trump has claimed that the amount of fentanyl coming from canada is massive and pledged to follow through by executing tariffs wednesday. we are making progress to end this terrible fentanyl crisis, but republicans in the senate must vote to keep the national emergency in place, so we can finish the job, and end the scourge, still, a few of republicans have indicated they are considering voting for the legislation, which would need just a simple majority to pass the senate. sen. susan collins, a maine republican, said she was still examining the bill, yet added she supported its intent because canadian tariffs are disastrous for the state of maine. canadas our friends and our ally, and this is not china were talking about. its not an adversarial nation. its our biggest trading partner, and this just makes no sense, she added. republican leaders in the senate have signaled they arent exactly fans of tariffs, but argued that trump is using them as a negotiating tool. i think all of us are anxious to see and well wait to see what the president actually comes out with in terms of tariff policy tomorrow, but i dont think that should change peoples vote, senate majority leader john thune, r-s.d., told reporters at the capitol. he added that the emergency declaration was made to deal with the flow of fentanyl. while trumps close allies in the senate were standing steadfastly by the idea of remaking the u.s. economy through tariffs, others have begun openly voicing their dissatisfaction with trade wars that could disrupt industries and raise prices on autos, groceries, housing and other goods. im keeping a close eye on all these tariffs because oftentimes the first folks that are hurt in a trade war are your farmers and ranchers, said sen. steve daines, a montana republican. sen. john kennedy, a louisiana republican, said he would prefer to see the u.s. and its trading partners move to remove all tariffs on each other, but he conceded that trumps tariff threats had injected uncertainty into global markets. were in uncharted waters, kennedy told reporters. nobody knows what the impact of these tariffs is going to be. ___ associated press writer kevin freking contributed reporting.

  Title: Republican backlash to Trump tariffs grows as Senate rebels decry ‘bad policy’
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-03 17:29:12)
  Content: the first signs of an internal us political backlash against donald trumps declaration of a global trade war are starting to emerge amid tanking stock markets worldwide, including on wall street, and widespread international criticism of the move. hours after trump unveiled a sweeping panoply of tariffs in an event he dubbed liberation day, four republican senators openly defied him by voting for a senate resolution from democrats demanding that the 25 tariffs on canadian products be reversed. the resolution lacks the force of law but its support from mitch mcconnell and rand paul, both of kentucky, susan collins of maine, and lisa murkowski of alaska, immediately signaled the deep misgivings among some republicans over trumps tariff gambit, which has triggered a global sell-off. mcconnell, the former senate majority leader, issued a scathing denunciation after wednesday evenings vote, calling tariffs bad policy that would trigger economic hardship. trade wars with our partners hurt working people most, he said in a statement. tariffs drive up the cost of goods and services. they are a tax on everyday working americans. further criticism came from trumps former vice-president, mike pence, who called the tariffs the largest peacetime tax hike in us history. these tariffs are nearly 10 times the size of those imposed during the trump-pence administration, and will cost american families over 3,500 per year, he posted. the four republicans who voted with democrats did so despite a public appeal from trump not to support the resolution, tabled by tim kaine, a democratic senator for virginia who was hillary clintons running mate in the 2016 presidential election, which trump won. the resolution was aimed at curtailing the powers trump claimed under the international emergency economic powers act, which he has invoked to tackle the uss 1.2tn trade deficit and, in the case of canada, cited the influx of fentanyl through its border. mcconnell pulled no punches in his attack on trumps policy. preserving the long-term prosperity of american industry and workers requires working with our allies, not against them. with so much at stake globally, the last thing we need is to pick fights with the very friends with whom we should be working with to protect against chinas predatory and unfair trade practices, he said. he added at a time when americans are tightening their belts, we would do well to avoid policies that heap on the pain. we ought to strengthen our friendships abroad, and reinforce our allies as pillars of american prosperity and security. paul, his fellow kentuckian, said the tariffs were unconstitutional. our constitution was very specific that taxes tariffs are a tax taxes originate in the house, come to the senate and then go the president, he told reporters. they dont just go to the president and no one else. what kind of system would it be if all of our taxes and laws were passed by one person? he later told fox news trade is proportional to wealth. the last 70 years of international trade has been an exponential curve upwards, and the last 70 years of prosperity has been upwards also. we are richer because of trade with canada, and so is canada. collins, the senator for maine, said tariffs would damage lobstering, agriculture and the pulp and paper industries in her state, which borders canada. she also lambasted imposing tariffs on us allies. the fact is, the vast majority of fentanyl in america comes from the southern border rather than from canada, she said on the senate floor. one of my biggest concerns is we should be distinguishing between allies and our adversaries and not treating them the same way. murkowski, a senator from alaska, said tariffs would also hurt her state and urged trump to find a better way to mutually secure our borders and address fentanyl trafficking than by starting a trade war. while not all canadian trade practices are fair, im keenly aware of the negative impacts in store for alaskan families and businesses should tariffs drive up the costs of essential goods, she posted on x. in alaska we share more than 1,538 miles of border with canada. we are friends, neighbors, partners, and allies when it comes to our economies, our mutual defense, our cultures, and, yes, our trade. the outspoken republican criticism hinted at a wider unease in the party that is mostly being kept muted for fear of repercussions from trump. thom tillis, a republican senator for north carolina, warned about potential irreparable damage to his farming constituents before wednesdays announcement. anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right need to talk to my farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy, he told cnn. they dont have time. so weve got to be crisp on this implementation. john thune, the republican senate majority leader, tried to reconcile his concerns with loyalty to trump. ive got my issue. i represent a state that is very dependent upon exports, he told reporters. but i do appreciate the presidents focus on making sure were getting better deals, and giving business an incentive to do business here in the united states. such equivocation contrasted with unambiguous condemnation from democrats, some of whom openly lauded the republican anti-tariff rebels. this is what happens when people speak up, posted the new jersey senator, cory booker, citing images of news headlines about the four senators votes and obliquely referencing his record-breaking senate floor speech this week denouncing trumps policies. chuck schumer, the democratic leader in the senate, posted 54 tariffs on china, 10 tariffs on iran, 0 tariffs on russia alongside a puzzled emoji. brian schatz, a hawaii senator and the democrats chief whip, posted ive never seen a president ruin the economy on purpose. responding, chris murphy, the outspoken connecticut senator who has emerged as an articulate advocate of the need for a democratic anti-trump fightback, wrote this is the thing to understand. its all on purpose. creating chaos and crisis.

  Title: Trump Advisers Say 50-Plus Countries Have Reached Out for Tariff Talks With White House
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-06 18:32:26)
  Content: fort lauderdale, fla. ap top administration officials said sunday that more than 50 countries targeted by president donald trumps new tariffs have reached out to begin negotiations over the sweeping import taxes that have sent financial markets reeling, raised fears of a recession and upended the global trading system. the higher rates are set to be collected beginning wednesday, ushering in a new era of economic uncertainty with no clear end in sight. treasury secretary scott bessent said unfair trade practices are not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks. the united states, he said, must see what the countries offer and whether its believable. trump, who spent the weekend in florida playing golf, posted online that we will win. hang tough, it wont be easy. his cabinet members and economic advisers were out in force sunday defending the tariffs and downplaying the consequences for the global economy. there doesnt have to be a recession. who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week? bessent said. what we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity. trumps tariff blitz, announced april 2, fulfilled a key campaign promise as he acted without congress to redraw the rules of global trade. it was a move decades in the making for trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the u.s. he is gambling that voters will be willing to endure higher prices for everyday items to enact his economic vision. countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with china and others retaliating quickly. top white house economic adviser kevin hassett acknowledged that other countries are angry and retaliating, and, he said, by the way, coming to the table. he cited the office of the u.s. trade representative as reporting that more than 50 nations had reached out to the white house to begin talks. adding to the turmoil, the new tariffs are hitting american allies and adversaries alike, including israel, which is facing a 17 tariff. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is set to visit the white house monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion with trump along with the war in gaza and other issues. another american ally, vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs. trump said vietnams leader said in a telephone call that his country wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s. and a key european partner, italian premier giorgia meloni, said she disagreed with trumps move but was ready to deploy all the tools negotiating and economic necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized. commerce secretary howard lutnick made clear there was no postponing tariffs that are days away. the tariffs are coming. of course they, he said, adding that trump needed to reset global trade. but he committed only to having them definitely remain for days and weeks. in congress, where trumps republican party has long championed free trade, the tariff regiment has been met with applause but also significant unease. several republican senators have already signed onto a new bipartisan bill that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to congress. lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. wyomings john barrasso, the no. 2 member of the senates gop leadership, said trump is doing what he has every right to do. but, he acknowledged, there is concern, and theres concern across the country. people are watching the markets. therell be a discussion in the senate, barrasso said of the tariffs. well see which way the discussion goes. trumps government cost-cutting guru, billionaire businessman elon musk, had been relatively silent on trumps tariffs, but said at a weekend event in italy that he would like to see the u.s. and europe move to a zero-tariff situation. the comment from the tesla owner who leads trumps department of government efficiency drew a rebuke from white house trade adviser peter navarro. elon, when he is on his doge lane, is great. but we understand whats going on here. we just have to understand. elon sells cars, navarro said. he added hes simply protecting his own interest as any business person would do. lawrence summers, an economist who was treasury secretary under democratic president bill clinton, said trump and his economic team are sending contradictory messages if they say they are interested in reviving manufacturing while still being open to negotiating with trade partners. if other countries eliminate their tariffs, and the u.s, does, too, he said, its just making a deal, then we dont raise any revenue nor do we get any businesses to relocate to the united states. if its a permanent revenue source and trying to get businesses to relocate to the united states, then were going to have these tariffs permanently. so the president cant have it both ways. bessent was on nbcs meet the press, hassett and summers appeared on abcs this week, lutnick and barrasso were on cbs face the nation and navarro was interviewed on fox news channels sunday morning futures. ______ associated press writers giada zampano in rome and fatima hussein in jupiter, florida, contributed to this report. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: Analysis-Trump Uses Power Against Foes Unlike Any Other Modern US President
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-02 05:05:38)
  Content: by james oliphant and jeff mason washington reuters -in just 10 weeks in office, donald trump has imposed his will on perceived adversaries in business, politics, the media and allied nations by leveraging power in ways no other modern u.s. president has tried. his administration has sought the arrest and deportation of student protesters, withheld federal funds from colleges, ostracized law firms tied to his political opponents, threatened judges and tried to pressure journalists. at the same time trump has downsized the federal government dramatically and purged it of workers who could stand in his way. central to this effort has been trumps use of policy-making executive orders to target opponents as never before. he has been unafraid to employ lawsuits, public threats and the power of the federal purse to bring institutions to heel. what unites all these efforts is trumps desire to shut down every potential source of resistance to the maga agenda and to his personal power, said peter shane, a law professor at new york university. some targets have rushed to placate the president, a few have fought back and many are still trying to figure out how to respond. many of trumps actions are being challenged in courts, where some judges have tried to slow him down. the stunning speed and breadth of the republican presidents actions have caught democrats, public-service unions, ceos and the legal profession off guard. trumps supporters say he is simply using the full reach of his presidency to achieve the goals he set as a candidate. hes laid out these broad battle lines, whether its with people that he thinks have tried to ruin him personally, whether its with people he thinks have tried to ruin western civilization, said republican strategist scott jennings, a longtime adviser to senator mitch mcconnell. everything he said he was going to do on the campaign, hes doing. trumps aims are not just political. his actions show he wants to reorder american society with an all-powerful executive at the top, where financial, political and cultural institutions carry his stamp and where opposition is either co-opted or curtailed. with a compliant congress controlled by his party and a u.s. supreme court dominated by conservatives, trump is operating with fewer checks on his power than any of his modern-day predecessors. trump has attempted to subdue and cajole his adversaries on an almost-daily basis, backed by the fearsome might of the law enforcement and regulatory agencies at his command. he has often succeeded. he managed to wring concessions out of several of his targets, including storied columbia university, powerful law firms and corporate titans such as meta and disney. all of them settled with the white house rather than endure the pressure, surrendering some independence and setting what some view as damaging precedents. others are taking preemptive measures to avoid trumps wrath. more than 20 of americas largest companies and financial firms, including goldman sachs, google and pepsico, have rolled back diversity programs that had drawn trumps ire. three law firms cut deals with the administration rather than risk losing their lawyers security clearances, access to government buildings and perhaps, as a result, clients, while three others targeted by trumps executive orders sued in response. trumps orders have also been his vehicle to remake the government, deport alleged venezuelan gang members with little due process and levy tariffs against u.s. trading partners. he has sued u.s. media corporations and silenced the voice of america, taken control of the kennedy center, a leading arts facility, and sought to put curbs on the smithsonian institution, whose mission is to chronicle history. his administration has detained student protesters whose political views it says are a threat to the country. trump has pushed a mineral-rights deal on ukraines leadership with the veiled threat of ending u.s. support for kyiv in the russian war in ukraine. he has threatened nato ally denmark to try to wrest control of greenland, spoken of annexing canada and threatened to take the panama canal back from its home country. tailored strikes mark zaid, a washington lawyer who represents whistleblowers against the federal government and who himself had his security clearance stripped away by trump, said the presidents conduct is like nothing he has seen in his 30-year career. executive orders have never been designed to specifically target individuals nor non-government actors for purposes of retaliation or retribution, zaid said. the white house and trumps allies deny the president is acting out of revenge. a white house spokesman said more traditional approaches have failed to bring meaningful change. unconventional is precisely what the american people voted for when they elected president trump, white house spokesman harrison fields said. the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy. in his first term from 2017-2021, trump was hamstrung by a variety of factors a federal probe into russian interference, his aides lack of experience and greater democratic opposition in congress. with those roadblocks gone, an emboldened trump has demonstrated at the start of his second term that he has learned how to use the resources available to him more fully to get what he wants. he really does know how to pull the levers of power this time, more so than last time, said rina shah, a republican strategist. claire wofford, a political science professor at the college of charleston, said trump has used executive orders not only to push forward a policy agenda, but also to send messages to his political base, as in his attempt to scale back birthright citizenship, and to test the limits of his power, as with his invocation of an 18th-century law to designate some migrants as alien enemies. what strikes me most at this point is how strategic trump is - but in new ways, wofford said. funding and litigation in cases such as with columbia university, trump has used the federal purse as a cudgel, concluding his targets have financial interests that make them vulnerable to coercion. in other cases, he has used the courts, forcing companies such as disney and meta into favorable settlements after trump filed lawsuits against them. cbs news, another trump lawsuit target, is under pressure to settle its suit because its parent, paramount, is eager to have its proposed merger with skydance media approved by trump administration regulators. but not every institution has bent the knee. many of trumps actions, particularly those regarding his cuts in government, remain tied up in federal court. in the last two weeks alone, judges have ruled against trump in matters challenging his deportation policies, attacks against law firms and plans to eliminate government agencies. in response, trump and his allies have called for judges who rule against the administration to be impeached and drawn a rare rebuke from chief justice john roberts. walter olson, a senior fellow at the libertarian cato institute, said trumps attacks on law firms and judges are without precedent and are reminiscent of other nations with authoritarian regimes. clipping the wings of law firms and the courts, olson said, is the behavior of an autocrat. reporting by james oliphant and jeff masonediting by colleen jenkins and howard goller

  Title: Why Trump caved in to the markets and paused tariffs - EL PAÍS English
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-10 08:07:20)
  Content: donald trump couldnt handle the pressure for even a week. after launching a global trade war on his third liberation day, the u.s. president was forced to reckon with the reality that he was steering the country and with it, the global economy toward a recession. the breaking point came with a sharp selloff in treasury bonds. before that, a plunging stock market, internal criticism, and warnings from investors and business leaders had already put him under intense pressure. his resolve was being tested, and it buckled earlier than expected. on wednesday, trump announced a 90-day partial truce in the trade war excluding only china and at the same time escalated his measures against beijing. the move weakened his negotiating position, precisely what he had hoped to avoid. no, it wasnt all part of a master plan, as his aides claimed in an attempt to save face. trump admitted that he decided to change course on wednesday after a few days of reflection. it probably came together early this morning, he said during a photo op with race car drivers at the white house. trump implied that the market reaction had played a key role in his decision. over the last few days it looked pretty glum, he said. i thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. they were getting yippy, you know. theyre getting a little bit afraid, he admitted. until tuesday, trump seemed delighted that many countries were demanding negotiations and offering concessions. these countries are calling us up, kissing my ass, he said mockingly at a dinner with republican congressmen, adding i know what the hell im doing. a long-time advocate of tariffs, he initially shrugged off the market turbulence, imagining a world yielding to his demands. but his strategy didnt go to plan. in recent days, fear had spilled over into the bond market, where losses deepened on wednesday. u.s. treasury bonds typically viewed as risk-free, a safe haven in turbulent times were being sold off amid the chaos triggered by trumps actions, pushing yields ever higher. even the dollar was trading lower. on wednesday, trump was asked directly about the turmoil in that market. people were getting a little queasy, he admitted. the bond market is very tricky. i was watching it, but if you look at it now, its beautiful. yields on 30-year treasury bonds had surged past 5, up from 4.4 the week before. concerns grew that foreign investors, particularly china one of the largest holders of u.s. debt were reducing their holdings. with trillions in u.s. debt up for refinancing, this shift an unexpected setback raised fears of a broader financial crisis. former treasury secretary larry summers even warned that trump could be directly responsible for triggering one. the administrations erratic but aggressive trade policy was poised to lead to rising prices, plummeting corporate stock prices, and higher borrowing costs. the threat of recession was looming larger by the day. investor bill ackman warned of an economic nuclear winter. warnings from corporate leaders added to the pressure. on wednesday, delta air lines ceo ed bastian said the company was preparing for a recession. jamie dimon, chairman of jpmorgan the largest bank in the united states said he thought it was perfectly reasonable to conclude that global trade was unfair, but stressed that it was necessary to negotiate some trade deals and warned of recession risks. im taking a calm view. but i think it could get worse if we dont make some progress here, dimon said in a fox news interview, which trump later admitted to watching. at the opening bell, trump posted on social media that it was a great time to buy. he followed through on that sentiment later that day. at 118 p.m. washington time, he shared based on the fact that more than 75 countries have called . to negotiate . and that these countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the united states, i have authorized a 90 day pause, and a substantially lowered reciprocal tariff during this period, of 10, also effective immediately. the tariffs had been announced last wednesday and had only been in effect for a few hours. trump met with key cabinet members, including treasury secretary scott bessent and commerce secretary howard lutnick, before posting the message. we didnt have access to lawyers or it was just wrote up. we wrote it up from our hearts, right? it was written from the heart, and i think it was well written too, he later explained. the stock market responded with a dramatic rebound. by the close of trading, the sp 500 had risen 9.5, and the nasdaq jumped 12. nvidia alone gained 19, adding 440 billion in value the largest single-day market cap gain ever recorded. while de-escalating globally, trump simultaneously ramped up pressure on china, raising tariffs on chinese goods to 125 in retaliation for beijings latest moves. combined with a 10 universal tariff and ongoing 25 duties on steel, aluminum, cars, and components, the current tariff package is the most extensive in over a century. although the market welcomed the partial truce, the broader economic impact of these tariffs could still slow growth and fuel inflation. trumps admission that market panic had driven his decision put several close aides, including white house press secretary karoline leavitt who often criticizes the media in a difficult position. many of you in the media clearly missed the art of the deal. you clearly failed to see what president trump is doing here, said leavitt. what happened was trumps strategy all along, claimed bessent even though he was reportedly among those urging a course correction. stephen miller, deputy chief of staff, went even further you have been watching the greatest economic master strategy from an american president in history, he posted on x. a three-month period for negotiations now opens. until now, it wasnt clear whether trumps trade war was aimed at securing quick, phenomenal concessions or was part of a longer-term strategy to push for industrial reshoring. at this stage, neither has happened. trump has walked back most of his tariffs without securing anything in return. his bargaining position is now weaker. and its become clear the u.s. cannot afford to declare a trade war on the entire world at once. trump even floated the possibility of granting exemptions to companies hit hardest by the tariffs. when asked on wednesday, he said were going to take a look at it. there are some that, by the nature of the company, get hit a little bit harder, and well take a look at that. when asked how he would determine which companies might receive such an exemption, trump responded, instinctively. you almost cant take a pencil to paper. its really more of an instinct than anything else, he said. you have to be able to show a little flexibility, trump added just days after bluntly declaring my policies will never change. sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more english-language news coverage from el país usa edition quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?

  Title: Republicans join Democrats in Senate vote to rescind Trump Canada tariffs
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-03 00:42:22)
  Content: several republican senators joined democrats to pass a resolution that would block donald trumps tariffs on canada, a rare rebuke of the presidents trade policy just hours after he announced plans for sweeping import taxes on some of the countrys largest trading partners. in a 51-48 vote, four republicans susan collins of maine, lisa murkowski of alaska and both kentucky senators, the former majority leader mitch mcconnell and rand paul defied trumps pressure campaign and supported the measure. democrats used a procedural maneuver to force a vote on the resolution, which would terminate the national emergency on fentanyl trump is using to justify tariffs on canada. while trumps sweeping new tariffs, introduced in a white house rose garden ceremony on wednesday, did not include additional levies on canada, the senate vote amounted to a significant bipartisan condemnation of the presidents escalating global trade war with allies and enemies alike. tariffs will hurt our families. canada is not an enemy, the democratic senator tim kaine, the bills sponsor, said in a floor speech on wednesday. lets not label an ally as an enemy. lets not impose punishing costs on american families at a time they cant afford it. lets not hurt american small businesses. lets not make our national security investments in ships and subs more expensive. republicans have expressed varying degrees of unease over trumps clampdown on free trade once a pillar of conservative orthodoxy but few were willing to cross him, and many gop leaders and supporters, including the house speaker mike johnson, were in the rose garden on wednesday a day dubbed liberation day by the president as a way of championing the historic barrage of tariffs on goods from overseas he believes will boost american manufacturing. before the vote, the senate majority leader john thune of south dakota urged republicans to oppose the resolution, arguing that the tariffs were needed to ensure that president trump has the tools to combat the flow of fentanyl from all directions. in a post on his social media platform, truth social, sent just before 1am et on wednesday, trump assailed the four gop senators who had expressed opposition to his tariffs, imploring them to get on the republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize canada for the sale, into our country, of large amounts of fentanyl. he vowed not to sign the measure if it reached his desk. defending her vote, collins said that the tariffs would hurt working families in her state of maine, which shares a long border with canada. the price hikes that will happen for maine families, every time they go to the grocery store, they fill their gas tank, they fill their heating oil tank, if these tariffs go into effect, will be so harmful, she said in a wednesday floor speech. and as price hikes always do, they will hurt those the most who can afford them the least. she also argued that fentanyl from canada was not a major threat to the us, as trumps national emergency claims. the fact is the vast majority of fentanyl in america comes from the southern border, she said. democrats argued that americans were turning against trumps agenda, pointing to a string of strong performances by their party in recent special elections that included a consequential victory in a wisconsin state supreme court race on tuesday night. the american people are seeing how bad trump is, the senate minority leader, chuck schumer, said in a floor speech. tariffs is a good part of it. and they are not supporting people like elon musk and those who support donald trump. earlier on wednesday, the representative gregory meeks, the top democrat on the house foreign affairs committee, said he would also force a similar vote in the house on the tariffs. republicans cant keep ducking this its time they show whether they support the economic pain trump is inflicting on their constituents, he wrote on x.

  Title: Opinion: This isn’t immigration enforcement. It’s political theater. - The Salt Lake Tribune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-10 12:01:24)
  Content: federal law enforcement under president trump is engaged in dangerous political theater, with high-profile arrests of non-citizen students, workers and parents set up to score political points more than to protect national security. it is not impossible for the united states to have a humane immigration system focused on public safety that provides for the growth of the nation and local communities. ive seen those possibilities through my work in military intelligence, counterterrorism, homeland defense and cyberoperations and as the chief of staff at u.s. immigration customs and enforcement during the biden administration. border security and interior immigration are linked but separate challenges. in towns within the united states, there is an effective way to do interior immigration enforcement and protect our national security without undue emphasis on undocumented immigrants who do not have criminal convictions. right now, the government is burning thousands of federal law enforcement hours on operations that privilege political objectives over public safety, attacking constitutional protections like due process and free speech as they do. if this administration doesnt correct course, it will lock the country into a future of weaker enforcement, lowered trust in public safety officials and greater risk to americans collective safety. this is not the first administration to fail at this task. president barack obama leaned on broken enforcement policies, using deportation as a deterrent while unsuccessfully trying to reform the broader immigration enterprise. president trumps first administration implemented zero-tolerance policies that separated families, sought to end protections for children who arrived in this country as minors, prioritized draconian deterrence measures and relied on emergency public health restrictions, like title 42. the biden white house then continued to use emergency public health restrictions as a crutch to address a problem that needed a much more expansive solution. as each successive administration relied more on executive power to manage the system, congress did not pass structured, long-term immigration reform. but this moment is worse. the new trump white house is finding ever more cruel, even brutal, methods to publicly target some of the most vulnerable people in this country. while americans are distracted by sensational videos of anti-migrant enforcement actions from the trump administration on social media, the real threats grow. the homeland security secretary, kristi noem, recently announced that federal agents arrested roughly 20,000 undocumented people across the country in february. that doesnt mean 20,000 national security threats were removed from the united states. on average, the united states can deport only about 7,000 to 9,000 people monthly by plane, and detention centers were at maximum capacity. so what happened to the 13,000 other migrants who were arrested? the only rational law enforcement step would be to process and then release them. that means law enforcements time, energy and focus were wasted on a political stunt. and real people suffered. every ice agent dispatched to detain a noncriminal farmworker, construction laborer or college student many, if not most, of whom have legal standing to work and study in our communities is an ice agent not investigating fentanyl networks, cyberattacks, human trafficking or transnational gangs. those are the actual bad actors who threaten american safety and sovereignty. last month, the department of homeland security removed a maryland father to el salvador that it had no ground to deport, and despite well-documented threats against his life from local gangs. ice arrested and continues to hold in detention a tufts university student with no criminal record another case that lacks any public safety rationale. these cases send a message that law enforcement is a prop, not a protector. the machinery of federal law enforcement is powerful. thats what makes it so dangerous when misused by political opportunists. ice and u.s. customs and border protection have greater authority than most americans realize. they can detain people without a warrant, conduct searches without probable cause and deport people without criminal charges. these powers demand discipline, not spectacle. they exist to respond urgently to serious threats, prevent cross-border crime and detain individuals who pose risks when time or circumstances dont allow for traditional criminal justice processes. they do not exist to target migrant grandmothers from guatemala, unaccompanied children fleeing gang violence, haitian families seeking asylum from political collapse, palestinian and indian students who attended u.s. universities under lawful visas, or mexican and salvadoran families working and raising u.s. citizen children while trapped in immigration backlogs. over the past two decades, the united states has invested heavily in a sophisticated vetting infrastructure. it can flag threats based on identities, travel histories and behavioral patterns. its built to catch real bad actors before they can do harm. but instead of using its tools to protect children from abuse or disrupt transnational money laundering operations, they are being used to track down individuals with no criminal convictions, people who are providing our nation the benefits of their hope and hard work. when ice and c.b.p. are used in this manner, their mission is compromised. career agents are sidelined. morale drops. recruitment suffers. when communities see federal law enforcement used to punish rather than to protect, they stop cooperating. law enforcement loses tips, and witnesses. local partners hesitate to share information. thats how dangerous actors slip through. the real bad actors are getting smarter and faster. mexican cartels use tunnels and ultralight aircraft to move narcotics. cybercriminals attack hospitals and rural infrastructure. international smuggling operations launder profits through cryptocurrency. that means the best solution for public safety is not mass deportations its giving undocumented immigrants who have been in the united states for a long time the opportunity to come forward, pay a fine and gain legal status. this country needs law enforcement that goes after genuine threats, not just easy targets, and immigration enforcement that reflects who we are a nation built by immigrants and secured by law. law enforcement agents know how to do it. they built the tools. but if the current administration keeps misusing them, the people who intend to harm us will succeed. jason p. houser is a former ice chief of staff, department of homeland security counterterrorism official, afghanistan combat veteran, and u.s. cyber command liaison to israel and europe. this article originally appeared in the new york times. get the latest news by subscribing to our top stories newsletter. enter your email below to receive more stories like these right to your inbox.

  Title: Harsh trade retaliation from Canada, China show challenge ahead for Trump team
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-08 21:32:32)
  Content: president trump holds up an executive order on energy production tuesday. the president has said he is waiting for talks to begin with china, the third-largest u.s. trading partner after canada and mexico. canada will begin imposing 25 tariffs on select u.s. car imports wednesday, ratcheting up tensions between washington and ottawa as the rest of the world grapples with president trumps ongoing assault on the global economic order. canadas move came hours after beijing vowed that china would fight to the end over the trump administrations tariff policy, which it characterized as an attempt to blackmail the world. as of wednesday, all products imported from china to the united states would face a duty of 104. the news led to yet another day of market turmoil, with the dow jones industrial average, standard poors 500 and nasdaq all beginning the day with promising rallies that disappeared by the closing bell. the steps from two of americas largest trading partners one friend, one foe exemplified the challenges ahead for the trump administration, which said that its sweeping global tariffs policy on nearly every country on earth would remain in place. only direct negotiations with trading partners, on an individual basis, could potentially result in new trade agreements that would lift or ease some restrictions, officials said. prime minister mark carney said tuesday that canadas new tariffs will go into effect at 1201 a.m. edt on noncompliant vehicles from the united states, and on contents of cusma-compliant vehicles not from canada or mexico. cusma, called usmca in the united states, refers to a trade agreement negotiated among canada, the united states and mexico during the first trump administration. the trade war is already reverberating through the auto industry, with jaguar, land rover and audi halting exports to the united states, and u.s.-based stellantis which produces brands including chrysler, dodge and jeep announcing an initial round of 900 temporary layoffs at five u.s. plants. president trump caused this trade crisis, carney said in a statement posted on x. canada is responding with purpose and with force. trump told reporters tuesday that he was doing very well in making tailored deals with countries around the world, and said that over 70 nations had reached out to the white house to start negotiations. he added that the u.s. is taking in almost 2 billion a day in tariffs. but trump has said he is waiting, in particular, for talks to begin with china, the third-largest u.s. trading partner after canada and mexico. on wednesday, the administration will push forward with trumps threat to pile on additional 50 tariffs if china does not remove its 34 tariffs against the united states. trump first announced 20 tariffs against china soon after taking office, complaining that the asian nation had forced fentanyl to flood into the country. last wednesday, as part of his sweeping tariffs measure he dubbed liberation day, trump enacted an additional 34 tariff against the country. white house officials continued to champion tariffs as the ultimate leverage, forcing other countries to line up to negotiate with the president. white house press secretary karoline leavitt repeated tuesday that the phones are ringing off the hook from global leaders, hoping to negotiate an end to the crippling taxes. its because the world knows that they need the united states of america. they need our markets. they need our consumers, leavitt said. the president has a lot of leverage on his side. not only is china the worlds largest trading partner, it is the provider of many goods americans rely on from iphone components to cheap clothing. already, members of trumps inner circle and the broader republican party are questioning the presidents tactics. elon musk, the presidents close advisor and the worlds richest man, who has several businesses with interests in china, complained in recent days on x, which he owns, about tariffs. he called trumps trade advisor, peter navarro, dumber than a sack of bricks over his guidance to the president. navarro is truly a moron, musk posted. what he says here is demonstrably false. several republican lawmakers, including prominent gop senators, initially responded to the policy change with draft legislation that would reassert congressional control over tariff policy. but senate majority leader john thune of south dakota threw cold water on the bills prospects monday. i dont think that has a future, thune said. the presidents indicated he would veto it. i dont see how they get it on the floor in the house, so i think at this point were kind of waiting to see whats going to happen next. the lack of congressional action leaves countries around the world with little choice but to directly negotiate with the trump administration. yet it is unclear what trump will consider adequate for success in any bilateral agreement, much less whether a common standard will emerge for countries entering talks. sitting in the oval office on monday, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said to the president, we will eliminate the trade deficit with the united states. israel has been hit with a 17 tariff rate by the trump administration, ostensibly over the countrys trade deficit with washington. california feds to look into potential fraud and corruption in southern california homeless funds the homelessness fraud and corruption task force will investigate potential fraud and corruption involving local homelessness funds, with u.s. atty. bill essayli saying there will be arrests if federal laws have been broken. we intend to do it very quickly we think its the right thing to do and were going to also eliminate trade barriers, netanyahu said. i think israel could serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same. and yet, in response to a reporters question moments later, trump would not commit to lifting the new tariff rate on israel even if netanyahu were to fulfill his promise. maybe not, trump said. dont forget, we help israel a lot, trump added. we give israel 4 billion a year, thats a lot. the remarks suggested that case-by-case talks with trading partners would involve topics well beyond tariffs, and even beyond trade deficits, to possibly include foreign aid, military assistance and other matters unrelated to economic policy a series of negotiations that could take months, if not years, to complete. kevin hassett, director of the national economic council under trump, said in an interview with fox news on tuesday that the administration is managing a massive amount of requests for negotiations. its actually, logistically, quite challenging, he added. trump announced a baseline tariff rate of 10 for nearly all countries last week. for countries with higher, customized tariff rates assigned based on the presidents belief that they have treated the united states unfairly the new import duties are scheduled to go into effect on wednesday morning. russia was not included on the list.

  Title: Senate Votes To Block Trump Tariffs On Canada After Four Republicans Cross The Aisle
  Source: www.zerohedge.com (2025-04-03 15:35:00)
  Content: the senate has passed a largely performative rebuke of president donald trumps ability to impose tariffs on canada, after four republicans crossed the aisle for a 51-48 vote. sen. tim kaine d-va. c speaks alongside senate minority leader charles schumer d-n.y. r and sen. peter welch d-vt. at a press conference at the u.s. capitol in washington on april 2, 2025. kevin dietschgetty images the resolution - which has practically no chance of making it through the house and trump would veto anyway, passed hours after trump announced his so-called liberation day of worldwide tariffs, would end trumps emergency declaration on fentanyl trafficking used to justify tariffs on canada, though both canada and mexico are exempt from trumps 10 baseline rate, while products subject to cusmauscma are exempt. tariffs on imports from canada are still set to rise on thursday. auto tariffs announced last week will still push the average u.s. tariff rate on imports from canada to about 3.5 from 2.5 by our count, said rbcs nathan janzen and claire fan. that increase will still matter, but looks small now compared to dramatically higher tariffs set to be imposed on other countries. the four republicans who joined all senate democrats were lisa murkowski of alaska, susan collins of maine, mitch mcconnell of kentucky and rand paul of kentucky. following the vote, former senate gop leader mitch mcconnell r-ky said, as i have always warned, tariffs are bad policy, and trade wars with our partners hurt working people most. trump has argued that canada isnt doing enough to stop the flow of illegal drugs from entering the usa. in 2024, cbp seized 43 lbs. of fentanyl in its northern border sector vs. 21,000 at the southern us border. since january, authorities have seized less than 1.5 lbs in the north, according to federal data cited by ap. this is not about fentanyl. its about tariffs. its about a national sales tax on american families, said sen. tim kaine d-va, who initiated the resolution. democrats argued that trump is using the tariffs to pay for proposed tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy, but will also make it more expensive to build homes, buy cars and pay for imported grocery products. kaine pointed to aluminum imported from canada that is used by businesses ranging from pie makers to shipbuilders. -ap today, donald trump takes a sledgehammer to the american economy and even to the american dream, said senate democratic leader chuck schumer, who of course also had something to say, adding once the american people say, i dont want to embrace somebody, i dont want to vote for somebody, i dont want to support somebody who embraces trumps policies, things are going to change. during wednesdays presser, trump singled out canada as a chief beneficiary of unfair trading practices with the us despite not adding any new tariffs as part of the lutnick plan. why are we doing this? i mean, at what point do we say, youve got to work for yourselves and youve got to? this is why we have the big deficits, said trump. standing up for trump were several senate republicans - who insisted that canadas punishment was more about fentanyl than the impacts of tariffs. there are unique threats to the united states at our northern border, said majority whip sen. john barrasso r-wy said during a floor speech, adding that former president joe biden had also thrown open the northern border. the criminal cartels noticed and they took advantage. president trump is taking the bold, decisive, swift action that is necessary to secure that border as well, he continued. you can support zerohedge with the purchase of a high-quality, sharp, zerohedge multitool.

  Title: Travel to USA from almost everywhere falling under Trump...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-19 16:31:36)
  Content: overseas travel to the united states has declined sharply since president donald trump returned to office. industry experts say some of the reasons are plain to see reports of detentions and deportations, including the weeks-long lockup of european tourists, have sowed fears of bad experiences at the border. some countries have tightened travel advisories, and trumps whiplash tariffs have ratcheted up international tensions. last month, the number of overseas visitors fell nearly 12 percent compared with the same time last year, according to data from the international trade administration, an agency under the u.s. department of commerce. the downturn, after a 2 percent decline year-on-year in february, is the first meaningful drop since travel plummeted in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. if sustained, the decline could translate to billions of dollars in lost tourism revenue, industry experts project. some would-be travelers are nervous about the trump administrations policies. others are enraged by his rhetoric. some have doubts about their safety. the european union has begun to issue its u.s.-bound officials burner phones, for fear of surveillance, the financial times reported. the reaction of international travelers to avoid the u.s. is entirely predictable, said adam sacks, president of tourism economics, an industry research firm. the combination of policy and rhetoric that has been so divisive and combative and isolationist each successive policy and related polemics have been making the situation worse. the drop in visitors from certain countries and regions is especially stark. according to the international trade administration data, there were 17 percent fewer visitors from western europe in march, 24 percent fewer from central america and 26 percent fewer from the caribbean compared with a year ago. the agencys data, which relies on i-94 forms that travelers submit at the border as basic arrival and departure records, covers non-u.s. citizens and nonimmigrants from overseas staying one night or more, including for vacation, for business or to visit family. the data is considered preliminary because it does not contain figures for canada and mexico, which have not yet reported their data to the international trade administration. after canada and mexico, the largest share of travelers typically hail from france, germany, italy, spain, britain, japan, south korea, china, india, australia, brazil and colombia. visitor numbers from nearly all of these countries dropped in march. the number of travelers from colombia shrank by 33 percent, germany 28 percent and spain 25 percent year on year. instead of heading to the u.s., many europeans are opting to travel regionally instead, sacks said. over time, they may choose canada, mexico or the caribbean, he added. some fluctuations in arrivals are expected year-on-year, industry experts said easter, a major time for travel, happened in march last year but is in april this year. february was one day longer last year. so much is unknown about how much any of these things are going to factor in long-term, said michael schottey, vice president of the american society of travel advisors. theres a lot of just waiting and seeing. before trumps second term, travel to the u.s. was finally rebounding to pre-pandemic levels. the u.s. travel association, an industry group, estimates that travel injected 1.3 trillion into the u.s. economy and supported 15 million jobs last year. this years downward trend is alarming, said allison oconnor, a spokeswoman for the group. we attribute this to a variety of factors, including a strong dollar, long visa wait times, concerns over travel restrictions, a question of americas welcomeness, a slowing u.s. economy and recent safety concerns, she said. sacks said the declines are a harbinger for what were going to see the remainder of the year. it is likely getting worse. if the trend continues, he said, were looking at a decline greater than 10 percent for the year, which could amount to a projected loss in 9 billion in travel and tourism revenue. canada is the top source of international visitors to the u.s. the u.s. travel association estimates that there are about 20 million visits from canada annually, with many travelers escaping frigid winters to generate more than 20 billion in spending in states including florida, arizona and california. after trumps tariffs were announced, then-canadian prime minister justin trudeau urged citizens to instead buy domestic products and vacation within canadian borders. preliminary data from the canadian government shows that as of march, the number of canadians visiting the u.s. by car plunged by nearly 32 percent compared with the same time last year. the number of canadian residents returning from the u.s. by air declined by 13.5 percent. from mexico, arrivals to the u.s. by air dropped nearly 17 percent in march, compared with march last year. data for land arrivals the largest source of arrivals from mexico is not yet available. the administrations actions have completely turned the tide for international travel away from the u.s., sacks said. in a response to a request for comment on the downturn, the white house said trumps policies would bolster the countrys image. president trumps agenda to make america wealthy, safe, and beautiful again benefits americans and international visitors alike, anna kelly, a white house spokeswoman, told the washington post, pointing to the 2026 world cup hosted by the united states, canada and mexico, along with the 2028 summer olympics in los angeles, as moments to show all that makes america great.

  Title: 100 DAYS OF PUNISHING FOES...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article demonstrates how Trump actively shapes the public's perception by prioritizing certain narratives (e.g., 'political weaponization,' 'lies and abuses') and repeatedly emphasizing them. The text states Trump 'repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate' and 'denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him.' This constant reinforcement influences which issues voters deem important, potentially overshadowing other concerns.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the speed and scope of Trump's actions, noting that 'even the smallest slights drawing reprisals.' This suggests a potential underlying mechanism of personal vendettas driving policy decisions, raising questions about the stability and predictability of the administration's actions. What are the long-term consequences of such personalized governance?; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work.' This raises questions about the ethical implications of such arrangements and whether they constitute a form of extortion or coercion. Does this set a dangerous precedent for future interactions between the government and private entities?

  Content: reuters -hours after swearing an oath to defend the u.s. constitution on january 20, president donald trump signed an executive order directing his attorney general to scour the justice department and other agencies for evidence of political weaponization. the same day, pentagon staff took down a portrait of mark milley, a trump critic who as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been the highest-ranking military officer during trumps first term. that evening, trump stripped his former national security adviser, john bolton - who wrote a memoir critical of trump - of the protective secret service detail he had been given after the justice department said iran had threatened boltons life. in his first 100 days, trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies. these include former intelligence officials who investigated alleged russian ties to his 2016 election campaign and major law firms as well as former biden administration members and prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against him while he was out of power. trumps actions served notice that his campaign promise of political retribution was anything but rhetorical, after he repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate. but the speed and sweep of his actions have caught many by surprise, with even the smallest slights drawing reprisals. the republican president has used the machinery of the state and the power of the presidency to go after people and institutions that have aggrieved him in more expansive ways than any of his predecessors, historians said. its not unusual for presidents to have enemies, said jeremi suri, a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin. what is unusual is for the president to use the entirety of the federal government, not simply to exclude someone, but to directly punish them. trump has made particular use of executive orders - typically used by presidents to direct policy priorities - to target perceived foes by stripping them of security clearances, blocking them from government buildings or directing agencies to probe them for wrongdoing. he has launched multiple federal probes into maine after a verbal spat with the states governor, reached deep into the traditionally independent justice department to fire those he views as disloyal, pulled protective security details from his critics and ordered investigations into former officials who challenged his false claims that his 2020 election loss was rigged. on his first day in office, he removed clearances for 50 former national security officials who had signed a letter suggesting russia was behind a story about salacious material found on a laptop belonging to president joe bidens son hunter. no evidence of russian involvement has emerged. he has also taken away clearances for all three democrats who ran against him in presidential contests biden, hillary clinton and kamala harris. trump has focused much of his attention on the criminal justice system after claiming during his 2024 presidential campaign that his four indictments were motivated by politics. then-president joe bidens administration denied the accusations. in trumps first 100 days, his justice department has fired or demoted dozens of officials, prosecutors and fbi agents, including rank-and-file employees who worked on investigations into trump and the january 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob of trump supporters. in a speech at the justice departments headquarters in february, trump denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him with illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. traditional presidencies have failed to bring meaningful change to the ways of washington, and the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy, a white house spokesman, harrison fields, said in response to questions about trumps retribution efforts and whether they represent an abuse of power. utilizing every tool afforded by the constitution, the trump administration is prioritizing efficiency eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and fulfilling every campaign promise. the ferocity and the scope during his first term, trumps instincts for revenge were sometimes thwarted by his own appointees, many of whom were experienced government hands or establishment republicans. by contrast, trump has filled his second-term administration with steadfast loyalists more likely to back his directives than caution against them. meanwhile, the republican majority in congress has shown little interest in opposing his actions. trump has taken steps as well to eliminate internal watchdogs who might seek to constrain him, purging inspectors general and firing government ethics officials. all administrations, particularly when you see a switch from one party to another, seek to control the executive branch, said historian timothy naftali, the former director of the richard nixon presidential library and museum. its the ferocity and the scope of what hes done that makes it unprecedented. the republican nixon famously had a list of enemies, but he plotted against them in secret. his most aggressive ideas, such as using the tax-collecting internal revenue service to audit his foes, were often blocked by his own officials. other presidents have used their power to penalize rivals in more muted ways, suri said. democrat lyndon johnson sought to discredit his political rival, robert kennedy, in the news media, and republican george w. bush banned brent scowcroft, a former national security adviser, from the white house after scowcroft wrote a column opposing the iraq war. thats often how presidents use their power to go after enemies they keep them out of their administration and spread rumors about them, suri said. trump has frequently intertwined his personal animus against political opponents with his administrations ideological and policy objectives. in february, trump digressed from remarks during a white house meeting with governors to address maine governor janet mills, warning her to comply with an order banning transgender athletes. see you in court, mills, a democrat, replied defiantly. within a day, three separate federal departments had initiated inquiries into whether the state was violating civil rights law, imperiling millions of dollars in federal funding. the justice department sent mills a letter telling her maine was on notice while trump demanded a full-throated apology before the case can be settled. in early april, trumps agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, wrote mills to confirm that some school funding had been frozen. this is only the beginning, rollins warned her. nine days later, the education department said it was taking steps to cut off all federal school funding to the state, and last week attorney general pam bondi announced the justice department had sued maine in federal court. in recent weeks, trump has attacked law firms that once employed attorneys he views as enemies, arguing they undermined the judicial process by doing so. in february, he suspended security clearances for attorneys at the law firm covington burling who had represented smith, the former special counsel investigating him, and sought to cancel any government work the firm had. making little effort to hide his primary motivation, trump suggested sending the pen he used to sign the order to smith as a souvenir. trump has signed executive orders targeting five other law firms, in each case indicating that revenge was an essential factor. his order punishing wilmerhale, for instance, noted that it once employed robert mueller, who investigated whether trumps 2016 campaign had improper connections with russia. nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work on mutually agreed projects backed by the administration. in some cases, trump simply appears determined to get even with former members of his 2017-2021 administration who irked him. this month, the president ordered the justice department to investigate christopher krebs, his former cybersecurity chief who disputed trumps false claims about election fraud in 2020, and miles taylor, a former homeland security official who anonymously wrote a 2019 book critical of trump. signing the executive order targeting the two former officials, trump called taylor a traitor. i think hes guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth, but well find out, he said. dissent isnt unlawful, taylor responded on x. it certainly isnt treasonous. reporting by

  Title: Trump's agenda grapples with political and economic reality - BBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-05 00:02:40)
  Content: donald trump, in announcing his sweeping new tariffs on us imports on wednesday, promised that the history books would record 2 april as americas liberation day. after two days of stock market turmoil, however, this may also be remembered as the week the presidents second-term agenda ran headfirst into economic - and political - reality. us stocks have been in a tailspin since trump unveiled his tariffs at wednesday afternoons white house rose garden event, with signs that americas trading partners - canada, the european union and china, most notably - are not backing away from a fight. meanwhile, other presidential efforts, on foreign policy and immigration, and at the ballot box - have faced notable setbacks in recent days. the white house on thursday felt a bit like a building battening down for a coming storm. the four big posters showing americas reciprocal tariffs on a long list of countries were on prominent display in the press briefing room, but administration officials available to respond to media questions were few and far between. out on pennsylvania avenue, workers unloaded pallets of metal fencing, which will ring the white house grounds in preparation for what officials anticipate to be a large anti-trump demonstration at the nearby washington monument on saturday. the first lady announced that a white house garden tour event that had been scheduled for that day was postponed because of security concerns. even the normally loquacious president stopped only briefly to talk with the crush of reporters on his way to board the marine one helicopter on the first leg of his journey to florida. i said this would be exactly the way it is, he declared when asked about the days stock market turmoil. the markets - and america as a whole - would soon boom, he said. the president, it seems, is willing to wait out the tempest created by his tariff plan. he appears confident that his economic vision of a rebuilt, job-rich american manufacturing sector protected from foreign competition - a vision he has closely held for decades - will ultimately be proven right. the trump agendas close encounter with cold, hard reality wasnt limited to trade this week, however. his two top foreign policy priorities - ending the wars in gaza and ukraine - both appear mired in the kind of messy details and conflicting agendas that often obstruct lasting peace. israel has once again moved into gaza and escalated a bombing campaign that is generating reports of widespread civilian casualties. the ceasefire that trump touted in the days before he took office appears to be in tatters. russia, meanwhile, continues to pile new conditions on to negotiations for a full ceasefire with ukraine, which is an indication that the nation may be buying time to allow its ground forces to take more territory. if i think theyre tapping us along, i will not be happy about it, trump said of russia. but he added that he still believes president vladimir putin wants to make a deal. evidence so far indicates the contrary, according to jake sullivan, who was president joe bidens national security adviser. in an interview with the bbc, he accused trump of handing russia most of its demands, though he acknowledged it was still early in the process and things could yet change. so the current dynamic in these negotiations a is not in fact producing russian willingness to reach a fair and just compromise, but b is actually stimulating a view in moscow that if they just keep holding out, theyre just going to keep getting concessions from the united states. and so far that is what has happened. even trumps deportation and immigration enforcement efforts, which still have high public support, have been at least partially derailed by legal challenges. while his administration has successfully completed several flights transferring alleged tren de aragua venezuelan gang members to an el salvadoran high-security prison, the judge presiding over a case challenging those deportations said on thursday there was a fair likelihood officials had violated his court order to turn the flights around. other court challenges - to trumps suspension of political asylum processing and refugee resettlement, his attempt to end birthright citizenship and his revocation of temporary protected status for about 350,000 venezuelans - are currently working their way through the us legal system. at some point, the us supreme court is expected to weigh in on many of these disputes. this week also marked the biggest round of elections since trumps november 2024 victory, as voters headed to the polls in wisconsin to elect a state judge and in two florida special elections for seats in the house of representatives. while the republican candidates in florida prevailed, their winning margins were about 15, which is about half of what trump posted in those congressional districts in november. in wisconsin, a key political battleground state, the democratic-backed candidate won. democrats were able to maintain the liberal majority on the court despite the tens of millions of dollars spent by conservative groups, including by tech billionaire elon musk, who campaigned there in person. taken as a whole the results suggest that democrats are doing well in hotly contested races and may be making inroads even in reliably conservative areas - in part by campaigning against musk and his efforts to massively cut federal programmes and staff. that could be an indication that the party will have the political wind at their backs in state elections this november and the midterm congressional elections next year. the stock market tumult, and those ballot-box results, may be behind a few scattered signs of dissent within republican ranks. ted cruz, an arch-conservative senator from texas, said on his podcast on friday that trumps tariffs could hurt jobs and could hurt america - particularly if other nations retaliate, as china has already done. if were in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now, with massive american tariffs, and massive tariffs on american goods in every other country on earth, that is a terrible outcome, he continued. on wednesday night in the us senate, four republicans joined with democrats to support rescinding the emergency declaration that justifies trumps earlier canada tariffs. and on thursday, republican senator chuck grassley of iowa joined with democrat maria cantwell of washington to back a measure that would require congress to directly approve tariffs that stay in effect longer than 60 days. republicans by and large have been sticking with the president. they seem unwilling, or unable, to sway trump from his current course on tariffs and government cuts and appear fearful of the political consequences of breaking with the man who has a vise-like grip on the party. but if the current economic shock becomes a long-term hardship, and if government programme cuts translate into tangible disruptions in popular services or if trumps standing in opinion polls continues to sag, members of his own party may begin eyeing the exit signs for the first time in years. and that would bring an unceremonious end to some of trumps most ambitious efforts. trump, no longer worried about standing before voters, may feel liberated from the immediate political consequences of his actions - but reality has a way of asserting itself in the end.

  Title: How Trump Waged War on His Perceived Foes in First 100 Days
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-22 10:06:09)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article illustrates a Realist perspective on international relations applied domestically. Trump's actions, such as targeting perceived enemies and prioritizing national interests as he defines them, reflect a power-centric approach. The text states, "trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies." This demonstrates a focus on consolidating and exercising power, a core tenet of Realism.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Trump's use of executive orders to target perceived enemies, stating, "trump has made particular use of executive orders...to target perceived foes." This is intriguing because executive orders are typically used to direct policy priorities. Could this suggest a blurring of the lines between policy and personal vendettas, potentially undermining the legitimacy of the executive branch?

  Title: Trump rolls out tariffs on virtually all imports
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-03 15:48:27)
  Content: on liberation day, trump announced a 10 baseline tariff on all imports to america and higher reciprocal tariffs for some 60 other countries president donald trump wednesday unveiled a baseline 10 tariff on all imported goods and steeper reciprocal import taxes for specific countries, including 20 for the european union, an extra 34 for china, 24 for japan, 46 for vietnam and 50 for lesotho. hours after his announcement, the senate voted 51-48 to quash trumps earlier 25 tariffs on canadian goods, with four republicans joining the democrats. trumps 25 tariffs on imported cars and auto parts went into effect this morning. trump meted out the massive tariffs he has dreamed of for decades with the panache of a gameshow host, promising that they would restore fairness to u.s. trading relationships and revive u.s. manufacturing, politico said. his rose garden speech took place shortly after the stock markets closed, avoiding the visual of cratering markets that could have flashed across television screens as trump spoke. asian markets and u.s. stock futures dropped sharply following his announcement. for less than 2 a week, we will supply the cool, calm, complete intelligence you need. the tariffs amount to a historic tax hike that could push the global order to a breaking point while kickstarting a painful transition to higher u.s. prices on middle-class essentials such as housing, autos and clothing and disrupting the alliances built to ensure peace and economic stability, the associated press said. the tariff rates are shockingly high compared to what people were expecting, said peter tchir at academy securities to the new york times, and the formula to determine them is inexplicable in many ways. the senate vote to kill trumps canada tariffs was largely symbolic, given his veto and opposition in the gop-led house, the wall street journal said. but it still marked a significant rebuke of trumps expansive effort to overhaul u.s. trade policy with friends and foes alike. the tariffs are a breathtaking political gamble for a president elected on a wave of public anger over inflation, the washington post said. the early reaction from mainstream economists and business groups was grim, while industries that will enjoy new protection against foreign competition applauded. a free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day and the best features from theweek.com peter has worked as a news and culture writer and editor at the week since the sites launch in 2008. he covers politics, world affairs, religion and cultural currents. his journalism career began as a copy editor at a financial newswire and has included editorial positions at the new york times magazine, facts on file, and oregon state university. cartoons thursdays cartoons - a bull market, the wisconsin supreme court, and more by the week us published 2 hours ago the week recommends from ice climbing and backcountry skiing to dining inside a lava cliff, there is plenty to do by william leigh published 2 hours ago the explainer a us recession? a trade war with china? how liberation day could realign the globe by harriet marsden, the week uk published 3 hours ago speed read he spoke for the longest time in recorded senate history, protesting the trump administrations policies by peter weber, the week us published yesterday speed read mangione was charged with fatally shooting unitedhealthcare ceo brian thompson last year by rafi schwartz, the week us published yesterday speed read democrats prevailed in an election for the wisconsin supreme court despite elon musks robust financial support of the republican candidate by peter weber, the week us published yesterday the explainer spate of interrogations and deportations at us border sparking decline in overseas visitors by the week uk published yesterday todays big question delinquencies surge as the trump administration upends the program by joel mathis, the week us published 2 days ago speed read the white house correspondents association objected to the trump administrations bid to control where journalists sit during press briefings by rafi schwartz, the week us published 2 days ago speed read another 17 venezuelan alleged gang members have been deported to a notorious prison by peter weber, the week us published 2 days ago feature trump targets major law firms tied to his past investigations by the week us published 3 days ago

  Title: Full Episode: Trump announces tariff policy, DeSantis takes on Fine over CD-6 results - Spectrum News 13
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-03 00:30:00)
  Content: president donald trump announces his latest tariff policy, and lawmakers in the florida house advance a proposal to reduce sales taxes in the state. president donald trump ordered the implementation of reciprocal tariffs on nations around the globe wednesday, bucking concerns from members of his own party and volatile markets to levy import taxes on billions of dollars of products that could raise consumer costs for american households by thousands of dollars a year, at least in the short term. trump said at event at the white houses rose garden that the move, which will transform u.s. trade relations with trade partners around the globe, comes on one of the most important days, in my opinion, in american history and is in response to years of the u.s. being looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations, in the presidents words. its our declaration of economic independence. for years, hardworking american citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense, trump said at the event after walking out to a backdrop of numerous american flags. but now its our turn to prosper and in so doing use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and itll all happen very quickly. during his remarks, trump held up a chart showing the reciprocal tariffs would be roughly half of the rate of tariffs he claims other countries levy on u.s. products, including 34 tariffs on imports from china and 20 tariffs on imports from the european union. but the white house has offered few details, and it was unclear where the data on the chart came from. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. the president has promised that factory jobs will return to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk causing a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on cars, clothes and other goods. the new tariffs, on a day trump dubbed liberation day, follow similar recent announcements of 25 taxes on auto imports levies against china, canada and mexico and expanded trade penalties on steel and aluminum. trump has also imposed tariffs on countries that import oil from venezuela and he plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. trump invited brian pannebecker, a retired autoworker who spoke at the republican national convention to speak briefly at his white house news conference on tariffs. my entire life i have watched plant after plant after plant close, pannebecker said. pannebecker, a michigan resident, is the founder of auto workers for trump. the influential union united auto workers endorsed democrat kamala harris in the 2024 election but has backed trumps plans to boost tariffs on imported vehicles. the florida house on wednesday took its first steps toward permanently reducing the states sales tax. the house ways and means committee advanced the bill unanimously, but it still has a long way to go. the florida house still needs to persuade the senate and gov. ron desantis that this is the right path forward. though at the moment, neither is looking too thrilled about the plan. under the bill, floridas 6 sales tax would lower permanently to 5.25. the house estimates that floridians under the bill could save around 5 billion every year. floridas sales tax has sat at 6 since 1988. the bill would also reduce sales tax on a variety of other things like commercial sales tax, electricity, and mobile homes. we are clearly setting a course, and a vision is going to provide immediate, meaningful relief to every single floridian that makes a purchase, state rep. wyman duggan said. i candidly have some concerns with the education budget as it pertains to my school district, but i feel confident will work that out in the budget silo and delivering relief to everyday floridians in a quick and effective way should be our commitment, state rep. anna eskamani said. the house, senate, and the governor all want some sort of tax relief passed this legislative session. the house wants to cut the sales tax, but desantis wants property tax. and the senate stated it is somewhere in between, though some are concerned about any permanent cuts and the potential for a subsequent budget shortfall. gov. ron desantis reacted to the special election results wednesday. specifically, the race in u.s. house district 6. the governor reiterated that he had predicted rep. randy fine would underperform president donald trumps metrics in that district and blamed the candidate himself. i think you have a candidate in randy fine who one, hes a squish, desantis said. he supported restrictions on second amendment rights back in 2018. he tried to defeat my immigration proposal to help president trump enforce immigration laws. and he tried to enact a de facto, make florida a de facto sanctuary state. and so when people see that, our base voters dont get excited about that, youre not giving them a reason to go out and vote. the governor also rejected the idea that the 15-point swing in the district since november was a referendum on trumps agenda. fine fired back at the governor wednesday, writing on social media, a dying star burns hottest before it fades into oblivion. im focused on working with realdonaldtrump to stop democrats from taking this country backwards, not working with them. lets go.

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
