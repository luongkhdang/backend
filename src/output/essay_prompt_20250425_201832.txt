  Title: Reams of documents related to L.A. County sex abuse cases never turned over, lawyers say
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:11:23)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article illustrates aspects of the Principal-Agent Problem within the context of public institutions. The county (the principal, representing the public interest) delegates authority to its probation staff (the agents). The text highlights alleged failures of the agents (abuse) and a potential failure of the principal (the county) to adequately oversee, document, and respond to these actions over decades, as evidenced by the discovery dispute and the large settlement payout. This suggests a breakdown in the mechanisms designed to ensure agents act in the best interest of the principal and those they serve.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative around AB 218 and subsequent legislative proposals (like SB 577) reflects elements of Agenda-Setting Theory. The large volume of lawsuits enabled by AB 218 (an event/policy) has forced the issue of institutional liability and financial burden onto the legislative agenda, prompting lawmakers to propose new bills aimed at managing the fallout. The framing by Senator Laird about 'restoring equilibrium' suggests an attempt to shape the public and legislative perception of the problem and the proposed solution.

  Content: thousands of documents that could contain key details about rampant childhood sexual abuse inside a defunct santa clarita detention camp including so-called grooming drawings were left scattered inside the facility and never turned over to the victims attorneys, according to a firm suing l.a. county over the decades-old incidents. as part of the preparation for a looming june trial, attorneys with law firm manly, stewart finaldi had arranged april 15 to visit camp scott, a shuttered l.a. county probation camp where many of their clients say they were sexually abused as children. inside the facility were reams of records that the county should have turned over to the firm more than a year ago through discovery, said attorney courtney thom, whose firm has about 150 civil cases alleging sexual abuse by county probation staff. you can understand my shock when im walking through where my clients got raped as children, and there are documents everywhere, thom said at a monday superior court hearing in downtown los angeles. thom said she discovered thousands of paper grievances, a locked file cabinet labeled personnel files camps a w, and a drawing she believed was signed by thomas jackson a probation deputy accused by at least 20 women of sexually assaulting them at the camp. the drawing, included in a court filing, was of the name tami in big, block orange letters and appeared to be signed by a jackson. t. attorney james sargent, who is representing the county and accompanied thom for the tour last week, called her claims inflammatory and incorrect. they want to air what they deem as dirty laundry, said sargent, who told l.a. superior court judge lawrence riff that the personnel files they discovered had nothing to do with the staff named in the lawsuits. nor did the drawing, he said. tami wilson, a former supervisor at the camp, told him she recalled being given the hand-drawn card by a youth, he wrote in a court filing. the county announced earlier this month they planned to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of alleged sexual abuse inside the countys juvenile facilities and foster homes. the settlement believed to be the largest sex abuse settlement in u.s. history arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to file civil suits against alleged predators and the agencies that employed them. a handful of prominent firms including manly, stewart finaldi declined to participate in the settlement and have ongoing litigation. in the aftermath of ab 218, state legislators have introduced several bills to attempt to make it easier for governments and school districts to deal with the financial fallout from the deluge of suits. one of these bills sb 577 is set for a hearing tuesday. the bills author, state sen. john laird, said the legislation is intended to restore some equilibrium, lessening the financial blow to public agencies while still upholding a victims right to sue. county lawyers claim one reason the state law change has had such a devastating financial toll is because many of the records they need to fight decades-old cases are long gone. attorney john manly argued the claim flew in the face of what his firm saw at camp scott. the county has been telling all of sacramento that they dont have any documents, said manly, who urged the judge to allow his firm to publicize the footage theyd taken of the heaps of documents. we need to be able to share this with legislators. riff agreed with the countys request that the videos from inside camp scott remain confidential for now due to security risks, though he instructed both sides to try to find some common ground on whether certain videos could be made public. though camp scott hasnt been used to house youths for years, sargent wrote in a filing that may soon change. l.a. county superior court judge miguel espinoza ordered the county friday to prepare to shut down los padrinos juvenile hall the countys last remaining juvenile hall, where roughly 270 youths are held due to problems stemming from chronic understaffing. the youth presently in los padrinos will need to go somewhere, and if some wind up at camp scott, the public release of photos and videos could be seriously detrimental, sargent wrote. thom noted that both reporters and television crews have been allowed to broadcast footage taken inside the camp, including a 2001 documentary, camp scott lock-up. the l.a. times has been in there to photograph, said thom. mtv videoed more than we did.

  Title: Spain unveils €11bn plan to reach long-delayed Nato defence spending target
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-22 13:24:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: Spain's increased defense spending, spurred by pressure from NATO and the perceived threat from Russia ('vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security'), aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize their security in an anarchic international system. This action demonstrates a shift towards self-reliance and power balancing within Europe.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Spain's commitment to increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP, but also mentions criticism from coalition partners who describe the plans as 'incoherent and absolutely exorbitant.' This suggests internal political divisions regarding defense priorities and resource allocation. What are the specific concerns of the coalition partners, and how might these internal disagreements affect the implementation and effectiveness of the defense plan?

      > Snippet: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year
  Content: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year, saying it has become obvious only europe will know how to protect europe from now on. the country which lags well behind other western nations by dedicating about 1.3 of its gdp to defence spending is one of the nato members that has been pressured by the trump administration to increase its spending, and had previously committed to hitting the 2 threshold by 2029. but speaking on tuesday morning, spains prime minister, pedro sánchez, unveiled a 10.5bn 9bn industrial and technological plan for security and defence that will allow spain to meet the 2 commitment in 2025. sánchez said the plan, which has been approved by his cabinet and will now be submitted to the eu and nato, was needed to address the current and future defence challenges. its main focus will be telecommunications, cybersecurity and buying military equipment. the enemies of europe are not just using missiles as we have seen in ukraine over the past three years, he said. theyre also using unmanned drones and paramilitary forces to sabotage supply chains and to cut gas lines and underwater cables. theyre using social networks to issue disinformation and to polarise people and spread disaffection towards democratic institutions. theyre using ai cyber-attacks and quantum computers to compromise out telecommunications, our supply networks, and our public services in order to target our way of life. the prime minister who pointed out that his administration was finally making good on the 2 commitment pledged by its conservative predecessor in 2014 said the new plan would help reinforce european security in record time. in a world thats dominated by uncertainty, europe is hope and it is certainty and that certainty must be protected by strengthening our security and defence systems because given whats going on, its obvious that only europe will know how to protect europe, he added. and spain will contribute to protecting europe. sánchez said vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security, no matter how far any eu member state was from the frontlines of the conflict in ukraine. the security and stability of ukraine, of eastern europe and the baltic and nordic countries, is also the security and the safety of spain, he said. the people who live in those countries know that putin is serious and that his words are backed by deeds and thats why they look to europe for protection. theyre looking for something important, and that is unity. spain will not be indifferent to that demand. ukraine resists, europe responds and spain fulfils its obligations. sánchez also repeated his assurances that the additional spending would not lead to increased taxes, raids on the welfare state budget, or deficit increases. the plan has faced criticism from coalition partners in the leftwing sumar platform, who described the plans as incoherent and absolutely exorbitant. in january, donald trump increased pressure on nato, claiming the us had shouldered the global defence burden for too long and saying he would ask all nato members to increase defence spending to 5 of gdp. the nato secretary-general, mark rutte, has urged member states to use the threats from washington as an incentive to take unilateral action on raising defence contributions. last month, rutte said the pressure was already paying off in countries such as spain, portugal, belgium and italy. i tell them that, well, now i am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2 by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2 because we have to spend much, much more than 2 but now i am calling you, but you might get a very, erm, patient man from washington on the line if you dont listen to me, he said.

  Title: UN researchers warn that Asian scam operations are spreading across the rest of the world
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-21 15:23:50)
  Content: bangkok ap transnational organized crime groups in east and southeast asia are spreading their lucrative scam operations across the globe in response to increased crackdowns by authorities, according to a u.n. report issued on monday. for several years, scam compounds have proliferated in southeast asia, especially in border areas of cambodia, laos and myanmar, as well as in the philippines, shifting operations from site to site to stay a step ahead of the police. more recently, scam centers that have bilked victims out of billions of dollars through false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes are now being reported operating as far afield as africa and latin america. asian crime syndicates have been expanding operations deeper into remote areas with lax law enforcement that are vulnerable to the influx, according to the report issued by the u.n. office on drugs and crime or unodc. the report is titled inflection point global implications of scam centers, underground banking and illicit online marketplaces in southeast asia. this reflects both a natural expansion as the industry grows and seeks new ways and places to do business, but also a hedging against future risks should disruption continue and intensify in southeast asia, benedikt hofmann, unodcs acting regional representative for southeast asia and the pacific, said in a statement. unodc estimates that hundreds of industrial-scale scam centers generate just under 40 billion in annual profits. the trend to hedge beyond the region has been consistent with continued reports of crackdowns targeting asian-led scam centers that have been found operating in africa, south asia, the middle east and select pacific islands, as well as related money laundering, people trafficking and recruitment services discovered in europe, north america and south america. in africa, nigeria has become a hot spot, with police raids in late 2024 and early 2025 leading to many arrests, including people from east and southeast asia suspected of cryptocurrency and romance scams. zambia and angola have also busted asian-linked cyberfraud operations. in latin america, the report says that its notable that brazil has emerged as one country that has faced a growing set of challenges related to cyber-enabled fraud, online gambling, and related money laundering, with some linkages to criminal groups operating in southeast asia. it also notes that in late 2023 in peru, more than 40 malaysians were rescued after being trafficked by a taiwan-based gang known as the red dragon syndicate that forced them to commit cyber-enabled fraud. the report also points to crackdowns on asian-led scam centers in the middle east and some pacific islands. alarmingly, even as asian-led groups have been expanding the geographical scope of their operations, the involvement of criminal groups from other parts of the world is also growing, the report says. new online markets, money laundering networks, stolen data products, malware, artificial intelligence and deepfake technologies are laying the ground for the rise of crime as a service, the report says. these technological innovations facilitate conducting their businesses online and adapt to crackdowns. the convergence between the acceleration and professionalization of these operations on the one hand and their geographical expansion into new parts of the region and beyond on the other translates into a new intensity in the industry one that governments need to be prepared to respond to, hofmann says.

  Title: Bank of England rate-setter says US tariffs likely to push down on inflation
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 11:13:59)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article touches upon aspects of Realism in international relations, specifically concerning trade and tariffs. The US imposing tariffs on the UK, as mentioned in the text ('the us has imposed a 10 import tariff on goods coming from the uk, a policy which also applies to many other countries'), exemplifies a state acting in its perceived self-interest to protect its economy, regardless of the impact on other nations. This action, and the UK's subsequent economic considerations, reflect the competitive and often conflictual nature of international trade relations as described by Realist theory.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents Megan Greene's analysis of potential disinflationary effects of US tariffs on the UK, but also acknowledges 'a tonne of uncertainty around this.' This uncertainty, coupled with the mention of 'both inflationary and disinflationary forces,' suggests a more complex and potentially volatile economic situation than a simple cause-and-effect narrative. What specific factors contribute most to this uncertainty, and how might they interact to produce unexpected economic outcomes?; Intriguing_angles: The opening section discusses the importance of 'parsing out the facts from the messaging' in the context of US politics, while the latter part focuses on economic analysis of UK inflation. This juxtaposition, while seemingly unrelated, could subtly imply that economic narratives are also subject to manipulation or biased framing. To what extent might political messaging influence the interpretation and presentation of economic data, and what mechanisms might facilitate such influence?

  Title: SURVEY: Half Americans Have Given Up On Saving Money...
  Source: studyfinds.org (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights the prevalence of financial insecurity among Americans, influencing public perception and potentially shaping policy priorities. The repeated emphasis on savings shortfalls and reliance on savings for emergencies, "67 of americans feel theyre lagging behind their savings targets. even worse, 47 have completely given up hope," frames the issue as a widespread problem. This can lead to increased public concern and demand for solutions.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Gen Z's relatively high satisfaction with their banks (71%) but also their willingness to switch (45%). This juxtaposition is intriguing because it suggests a potential disconnect between perceived satisfaction and actual loyalty. What specific factors, beyond those mentioned, might be driving Gen Z's willingness to switch banks despite their reported satisfaction? Could this indicate a deeper dissatisfaction with certain aspects of banking services that aren't fully captured by the satisfaction metric?

  Content: keir starmer and rachel reeves have underlined how much the world has changed after donald trumps liberation day, with the uk prime minister even declaring an end to globalisation. but as the chancellor prepares to fly to washington this week to meet her global counterparts at the international monetary fund meetings, labour appears to see the risks purely in terms of the hit to international trade. while frantically negotiating with washington over tariffs, the government is pressing ahead with plans to deregulate the city just as global financial stability appears threatened by the chaos unleashed by the white house. labour has taken a muscular approach to saving the steelworks in scunthorpe, and reeves has written of the need for a strong, smart and agile state to support key industries. yet labours stance on the uks highly globalised financial sector appears to remain the one set out in the chancellors mansion house speech in november that rules imposed after the 2008 crash have gone too far. the governor of the bank of england, andrew bailey, appeared to raise a metaphorical eyebrow at that suggestion a couple of months later, when he used a speech to warn memories disappear in the rear-view mirror. and those of us who lived through it, worked through it and had to deal with it, are left saying just remember what we had to deal with. so far, little has changed, aside from regulators being hauled in repeatedly to explain themselves to the chancellor, and new remits issued, including to the financial conduct authority, urging them to target growth. but labour gives the sense of being intensely relaxed with the big beasts of high finance. hosting the us investment company blackrocks chief executive, larry fink, in downing street last autumn, starmer tweeted im determined to deliver growth, create wealth and put more money in peoples pockets. this can only be achieved by working in partnership with leading businesses, like blackrock. an edgy calm was restored to financial markets on both sides of the atlantic last week, after a wrenching sell-off in us government debt prompted trump to pause his reciprocal tariffs on 9 april. but the anxiety unleashed by wild moves in the market for treasuries us government debt underlined the risks that trumps policy will not only reorder trade flows but could put global financial

of risky bets. if investors really are reassessing treasuries value, as some analysts have suggested because of what in an emerging economy would be called political risk the consequences could rapidly be transmitted throughout the global economy. such a shock would come at a time when global debt levels stand at more than three times gdp, according to the washington-based institute of international finance far higher than in the run-up to the 2008 crash. these include the hefty debts run up by governments as they stepped in to cushion their citizens from the worst effects of the covid pandemic, but also household borrowing and the loans piled on to companies bought by the rampaging private equity sector. skip past newsletter promotion sign up to business today free daily

more cautiously with regulation since the crisis but by other, less-regulated private lenders. as a recent british private equity venture capital association bvca update put it the global financial crisis was the catalyst for growth, as banks adopted more conservative lending practices and deleveraged their balance sheets. and since the uk remains a leading global financial centre, this barely regulated, non-bank lending has exploded here with fund managers holding 257.9bn 194.7bn of private debt by the end of 2023, according to the bvca a staggering sum, which it pointed out amounted to 64 of the european total. the bank of england has been working hard to track how players in this shadow banking sector might respond in the event of a crisis including by carrying out a fearsomely complex choose-your-own-adventure exercise it calls the system-wide exploratory scenario, launched after the liz truss market scare. its results underlined how a fiendish spiders web of financial interconnections could amplify a potential shock. the bank, which keeps a much closer eye on financial stability these days, is confident it has the tools to respond, but the complexity of the system is reminiscent of the little-understood dependencies that bound the global financial system together before the 2008 crisis. despite the size of the uks finance sector, it has not tended to generate a wall of cash flooding towards key national investment priorities, or growing uk businesses, which often complain they struggle to find funding. labour are taking measures to encourage private sector investment into green projects and much-needed infrastructure by consolidating pension funds, and through the new national wealth fund, for example. yet this more activist approach sits alongside an intention to cut back regulation rather than, say, bring shadow banking under firmer control aside from buy now, pay later lending, where labour have rightly pressed ahead with tory plans to regulate although not until 2026. starmer and reeves are right to rethink globalisation. but they would be wise to remember that it is not only steelworkers in scunthorpe who are exposed to its unforgiving forces. if a crisis hits the hyperglobalised financial system which includes the private equity companies that have gleefully gobbled up care homes and nurseries across the uk we are all at risk.

  Title: Spain unveils €11bn plan to reach long-delayed Nato defence spending target
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-22 13:24:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: Spain's increased defense spending, spurred by pressure from NATO and the perceived threat from Russia ('vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security'), aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize their security in an anarchic international system. This action demonstrates a shift towards self-reliance and power balancing within Europe.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Spain's commitment to increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP, but also mentions criticism from coalition partners who describe the plans as 'incoherent and absolutely exorbitant.' This suggests internal political divisions regarding defense priorities and resource allocation. What are the specific concerns of the coalition partners, and how might these internal disagreements affect the implementation and effectiveness of the defense plan?

      > Snippet: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year
  Content: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year, saying it has become obvious only europe will know how to protect europe from now on. the country which lags well behind other western nations by dedicating about 1.3 of its gdp to defence spending is one of the nato members that has been pressured by the trump administration to increase its spending, and had previously committed to hitting the 2 threshold by 2029. but speaking on tuesday morning, spains prime minister, pedro sánchez, unveiled a 10.5bn 9bn industrial and technological plan for security and defence that will allow spain to meet the 2 commitment in 2025. sánchez said the plan, which has been approved by his cabinet and will now be submitted to the eu and nato, was needed to address the current and future defence challenges. its main focus will be telecommunications, cybersecurity and buying military equipment. the enemies of europe are not just using missiles as we have seen in ukraine over the past three years, he said. theyre also using unmanned drones and paramilitary forces to sabotage supply chains and to cut gas lines and underwater cables. theyre using social networks to issue disinformation and to polarise people and spread disaffection towards democratic institutions. theyre using ai cyber-attacks and quantum computers to compromise out telecommunications, our supply networks, and our public services in order to target our way of life. the prime minister who pointed out that his administration was finally making good on the 2 commitment pledged by its conservative predecessor in 2014 said the new plan would help reinforce european security in record time. in a world thats dominated by uncertainty, europe is hope and it is certainty and that certainty must be protected by strengthening our security and defence systems because given whats going on, its obvious that only europe will know how to protect europe, he added. and spain will contribute to protecting europe. sánchez said vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security, no matter how far any eu member state was from the frontlines of the conflict in ukraine. the security and stability of ukraine, of eastern europe and the baltic and nordic countries, is also the security and the safety of spain, he said. the people who live in those countries know that putin is serious and that his words are backed by deeds and thats why they look to europe for protection. theyre looking for something important, and that is unity. spain will not be indifferent to that demand. ukraine resists, europe responds and spain fulfils its obligations. sánchez also repeated his assurances that the additional spending would not lead to increased taxes, raids on the welfare state budget, or deficit increases. the plan has faced criticism from coalition partners in the leftwing sumar platform, who described the plans as incoherent and absolutely exorbitant. in january, donald trump increased pressure on nato, claiming the us had shouldered the global defence burden for too long and saying he would ask all nato members to increase defence spending to 5 of gdp. the nato secretary-general, mark rutte, has urged member states to use the threats from washington as an incentive to take unilateral action on raising defence contributions. last month, rutte said the pressure was already paying off in countries such as spain, portugal, belgium and italy. i tell them that, well, now i am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2 by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2 because we have to spend much, much more than 2 but now i am calling you, but you might get a very, erm, patient man from washington on the line if you dont listen to me, he said.

not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. markets plunged as wall street opened on thursday morning after donald trump unveiled his latest wave of tariffs on what the president called liberation day. trumps announcement sent shockwaves through markets around the globe, and shortly after the bell rang at the new york stock exchange, the dow jones industrial average fell 1,150 points or 2.7. the sp 500 dropped more than 3, and the tech-focused nasdaq more than 4.2. the president announced that blanket 10 percent tariffs will be imposed on all nations in a speech at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden shortly after regular trading hours closed in the u.s. about 60 countries deemed the worst offenders including china where a majority of apples devices are manufactured face higher reciprocal levies nearing, in some cases, 50 percent leaving world leaders reeling. the baseline tariffs go into effect on saturday and reciprocal tariffs on wednesday. meanwhile, four republican senators joined every democratic senator in a resolution to oppose trumps tariffs against canada. the senate passed the resolution crafted by kentucky senator rand paul 51-48 on wednesday after trumps announcement. a senate hearing devolved into chaos after sen. ted cruz repeatedly spoke over sen. amy klobuchar as the pair exchanged barbs over nationwide injunctions inhibiting president donald trumps agenda. during wednesdays hearing, the texas lawmaker excoriated federal judges and declared that nationwide injunctions are an abuse of power. cruzs comments come as republicans are attempting to pass a bill to limit judicial rulings against the trump administration. james liddell reports. andrew feinberg and katie hawkinson report from washington, d.c. far-right activist laura loomer met with president donald trump and pressed him to fire several members of the national security council and reports indicate he has taken her advice. trump fired several members of the national security council, including senior directors, after the meeting, axios reports. one u.s. official told the outlet the firings are shaping up to be a bloodbath. the new yorktimes added that at least three senior nsc officials have been fired. this comes after times first reported loomer met with trump, vice president jd vance, national security adviser mike waltz and others in the oval office on wednesday, armed with extensive research she believed worked against several staffers. donald trumps press secretary has claimed that he is partly responsible for a spiritual revival in america and is helping people move closer to god. karoline leavitt, a practicing roman catholic, said that evidence of renewed faith, especially within younger generations, was becoming more visible and that it was a beautiful sight. mike bedigan has the story. an economic analyst says the 50 percent reciprocal trade tariff on lesotho will kill the tiny southern african kingdom that the u.s. president ridiculed last month. spains prime minister has led european leaders in condemning donald trumps sweeping tariffs. pedro sanchez, whose country sells large amounts of car parts, steel and chemicals to the us, described the move to bring in reciprocal tariffs on imported goods from the eu as unintelligent and a return to 19th-century protectionism. steffie banatvala reports. its midday in new york, two and half hours since markets opened on wall street, and initial losses on the major indices appear to have leveled out for now and even recovered slightly from their trading low points. they all remain significantly down from the

vehicles imported from the united states that are not compliant with the u.s.-mexico-canada trade deal, prime minister mark carney told a press conference on thursday. carney also said the new tariffs would not apply to auto parts and would not affect vehicle content from mexico. two senior lawmakers on the senate finance committee introduced legislation on thursday aimed at limiting u.s. president donald trumps ability to impose tariffs and requiring congressional approval for new levies within 60 days. republican senator chuck grassley and democrat maria cantwell presented a bill that mandates the president to notify congress about new tariffs, providing an explanation of the rationale along with an analysis of the potential impact on u.s. businesses and consumers. congress must pass a joint resolution of approval for the new tariff within 60 days otherwise, all new tariffs on imports would expire. this bill reasserts congress role over trade policy to ensure rules-based trade policies are transparent, consistent, and benefit the american public, cantwell said. as representatives of the american people, congress has a duty to stop actions that will cause them harm. the bill is based on the war powers resolution of 1973 and aims to reestablish limits on the presidents authority to impose unilateral tariffs without congressional approval. for too long, congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch, grassley said. grassleys home state of iowa relies significantly on farm crop exports, whereas cantwells washington state hosts many export-driven companies like boeing. the senate passed legislation on wednesday that would terminate new tariffs on canada. with reporting from reuters the newsmax team and former trump lawyer and ally rudy giuliani got to ring the opening bell at the new york stock exchange this morning. bit of a shame for them that it was on a day when the presidents

      (No specific snippets retrieved for this entity in this article)
  Content: fifth third bancorp executives highlighted their proactive management and the banks ability to navigate uncertain environments during a conference call thursday april 17 discussing first-quarter earnings. they said these qualities are especially relevant at times like the present, when potential tariffs could lead to any number of different scenarios through the remainder of the year. we cannot predict what the final tariff policies will look like, much less what the second-order effects on economic activity, fiscal policy and monetary policy will be, fifth third chairman, ceo and president tim spence said during the call. what we can do is to ensure that our business mix is more naturally resilient, run our balance sheet defensively and maintain optionality so that we can react quickly as conditions change. the ohio-based indirect parent company of fifth third bank is pursuing several strategies to maintain resilience amid this uncertainty, spence said. these include diverse national loan origination platforms that provide flexibility in generating loan growth investments in southeast branches and commercial payments that provide granular operational deposit funding and credit concentration limits that ensure a diversified portfolio across asset classes, industries and regions. the bank also highlighted its proactive approach to managing credit risk its diversified fee income sources and day-to-day management that maximizes optionality. spence said during the call that he traveled to meet with around 50 business owners in the five regions served by the bank and in sectors like materials, manufacturing, transportation, logistics, energy, automotive and healthcare to get their views on recent tariff announcements. while all the business owners said they were surprised by the magnitude of the announced tariffs, they were split about how the tariffs might play out, spence said. half of the business owners viewed the tariffs as a negotiating tactic, while the other half expressed concern that higher tariffs would remain in place on major supply chain countries like china and vietnam. nearly all the business leaders said they would need to push prices to offset tariff costs because they have limited ability to absorb these costs in margins, he said. what was maybe a little bit interesting to me is that the folks that have domestic supply chains were also saying they have to move prices in the u.s. because theyre expecting that if the tariffs hold, theyre going to experience volume losses in foreign markets, and they require a certain amount of gross margin dollars just to be able to cover overheads and run their businesses, spence said. amex projects resilient consumer demand, anchored by gen z and millennial growth fifth third bancorp diversification aids resilience amid tariff-driven uncertainty ai explained sorting through the alphabet soup of models capital one launches data security solution databolt despite economic uncertainties, vc and private equity investment in fintech is showing signs of recovery at least as seen through several recent announcements. current funding trends indicate a strong focus on b2b fintech solutions and platform development across the globe. investment activity is decidedly international in scope, with significant funding rounds for companies based in latin america, africa, india and europe, alongside activity in the u.s. the fintech landscape is being altered by the news this week of the global payments and fis dealmaking. tens of billions of dollars are attached to the transactions, focused on merchant services and embedded finance. the dollars are not flowing between the big guns in the payments space recent announcements of new funding rounds indicate a bit of buoyancy in money flowing to the smaller firms innovating digital payments, in both consumer-facing and b2b settings. and the investment activity, on the part of vcs and private equity firms, has been international in scope. its been widely reported that coming into 2025, fintech capital raising had hit a nadir in the fourth quarter of last year, with 21 billion representing the lowest level since 2016. more recently, as of this week, the data for the first quarter indicate that, as sp global has estimated, fintechs grabbed about 8 billion, up 46 from last year. the impact of tariffs, and dislocation in the capital markets, wed note, sharpened in april, and so any recovery may be volatile, to say the least. but even amid the tariff and trade wind dramas, recent announcements show that capital raises, though relatively small in terms of dollar amounts, are focusing on international players and platforms. plaids a standout here, having announced a 575 million funding round led by franklin templeton, alongside fidelity management and research and others, including existing plaid investors nea and ribbit capital. as reported this week, toku, an accounts receivable saas platform focused on latin america and based in chile, said it had raised 48 million in series a funding, bringing its total funding to 55 million. the announcement noted that the firms software connects companies erps with banks and payment rails, enabling payment orchestration and automated collections along with automated reconciliation in the back office. toku says it increases automated payment methods for enterprises from 10 to 90. pymnts reported tuesday april 15 that south africa-based payments infrastructure company stitch raised 55 million in a series b funding round to expand its offerings for enterprise merchants. the company said it will use the new funding to deepen its in-person payments offering, bolster its online payments suite and move into the acquiring space. stitch is now expanding its in-person payments solution and said it will add acquiring to its services list soon. the funding round had been led by qed investors. in india, varthana, a fintech that operates in the education financing space, has gathered 8.7 million in debt funding from b2b platform ofbusiness, through its oxyzo financial services unit. the funding will reportedly be used to back school loans extended to students. separately, warsaw-based startup bidfinance, the fintech behind a platform for trading debt portfolios, has raised eur 1.6 million in funding from venture capital funds 4growth vc, fundingbox, and a group of business angels. the capital will help support international expansion. a bit closer to home, in the states, as reported here, deck raised 12 million in a series a funding round to support its developer infrastructure for accessing any user-permissioned data. the funding round was led by infinity ventures. deck enables users to tap into user-permissioned data from more than 100,000 providers in more than 40 countries to, among other things, automate billing. this week in fintech from latin america to africa, funding focuses on b2b

  Title: Trump’s tariffs may be a blow to Europe and a gift to China
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-02 04:00:27)
  Content: youre reading an excerpt from the worldview newsletter. sign up to get the rest, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox on mondays, wednesdays and fridays. the details of what president donald trump has called liberation day are sketchy, but the impetus is clear. trump has signaled for weeks he wants to impose sizable tariffs on many imports to the united states. at a white house event wednesday, trump may announce a universal tariff on most imports or a sweeping series of reciprocal duties matching the tariffs of other countries. trump and his allies see such measures as necessary to redress perceived imbalances in global trade and also drum up new sources of revenue as the administration radically overhauls the workings of federal government. critics, though, contend that trumps protectionism will amount to a de facto tax on u.s. consumers, and may drive the country into recession even as prices remain high, creating a crisis of stagflation not seen in decades. it may provoke retaliatory tariffs from other nations, including u.s. partners and allies. for the trade skeptics in trumps orbit, the tensions could spur a revival of u.s. industry and manufacturing, as foreign businesses relocate their operations on u.s. soil. but the consensus among economists is damning. trump doesnt seem to understand basic international economics. a lot of the arguments he makes, adam smith was refuting two and a half centuries ago in wealth of nations, greg mankiw, an economics professor at harvard university, told my colleagues. i have not seen a more wrongheaded policy come out of a white house in decades. officials elsewhere fear an unraveling of globalization, supply chain chaos and tanking markets amid the uncertainty. on tuesday, european commission president ursula von der leyen said her continental bloc was prepared to fire back with their own tariffs on u.s. goods and services, even though the endeavor left colleagues utterly disheartened. europe has not started this confrontation, she said. we do not necessarily want to retaliate, but if it is necessary we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. on this episode, the crew breaks down president trumps new economic policy, including tariffs. will trumps new policies mean higher prices for americans? video the washington post the signs of rupture are everywhere. a recent opinion poll in france showed that a majority of the french public would support boycotts of u.s. goods in reaction to the trump administrations bullying of europe. another poll in germany in march found that only 16 percent of germans trusted the united states as an ally. last week, canadas new prime minister mark carney declared that the intertwined, old relationship his country had with the united states was over and explained why he chose britain and france as the first foreign stops of his premiership. its clear the u.s. is no longer a reliable partner, he said. it is possible that with comprehensive negotiations, we could reestablish an element of confidence, but there will be no going backwards. theres a chance that the tariff plan may yield a milder outcome, with trump scaling back some of his threats and hatching deals over tariffs in specific sectors and between specific countries. white house officials have scoffed at economists warnings, arguing that similar downbeat forecasts proved wrong when trump imposed more modest tariffs during his first term, my colleagues noted. but much about the initial months of trumps second term represents a radical departure from the first, and the administrations constant broadsides toward europe via speeches, social media posts and even threats of annexation have convinced many europeans that the transatlantic alliance is about to fall apart. trump is waging economic and political war on u.s. allies and dependants, observed financial times columnist martin wolf. but the resulting collapse in trust of the countries that used to share its values will end up very costly for the u.s., too. in beijing, analysts sense an opportunity. wang yiwei, director of the school of international studies at the renmin university of china, told spanish daily el país that the trump administrations actions caused transatlantic relations to be historically undermined and could lead to a softening in europes stance toward china. the biden administration spent months trying to persuade the europeans to more closely align their approach toward beijing with washington. what western geopolitical solidarity was forged under biden is now quickly evaporating. some say that the 2024 u.s. elections were not a transfer of power as much as a true regime change for the europeans, wang said to the spanish newspaper. da wei, a professor at tsinghua university in beijing, recently suggested to npr that trump was undermining a critical element of american power by alienating the countrys traditional partners and casting doubt over the reliability of washington. the alliances of the u.s. we believe are an important source, probably one of the most important sources of the u.s. strength, he said. in the eyes of the u.s.s closest asian partners in japan and south korea, china remains a competitor and putative threat on multiple fronts. but trumps latest tariff moves including stiff levies on foreign cars saw the three countries hold a strategic economic dialogue for the first time in five years this past weekend, with chinese state media reporting afterward that tokyo, seoul and beijing might even jointly coordinate their response to trumps tariff plan. japanese and south korean officials have distanced themselves from this suggestion. the white house appears unperturbed by the rest of the worlds angst indeed, it seems to enjoy being the proverbial cat among the pigeons. while trump may upend global trade, his administration at home is drastically slashing government, warring with civil society and universities, and flirting with a series of extra-constitutional maneuvers to get its way. to scholars in china, the radicalism of the moment is curiously familiar. what is happening in the u.s. is still far from the cultural revolution. its maybe 1 or 2 percent, da told npr. but you can sense that smell. the populist sentiments common sense is good. so those sophisticated thoughts are something bad. michael froman, president of the council on foreign relations and a former top trade official in the obama administration, argued that the trump era is accelerating the arrival of a world order more shaped in chinas image, with the united states pursuing a form of chinese policy with american characteristics.

  Title: Trump announces sweeping new tariffs, baseline tax on imports - Syracuse.com
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-02 21:01:00)
  Content: president donald trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the rose garden at the white house, wednesday, april 2, 2025, in washington. ap photomark schiefelbeinap washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the tariffs follow similar recent announcements of 25 taxes on auto imports levies against china, canada and mexico and expanded trade penalties on steel and aluminum. trump has also imposed tariffs on countries that import oil from venezuela and he plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose have caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy, despite the risk of political backlash as voters in last years election said they wanted trump to combat inflation. senior administration officials, who insisted on anonymity to preview the new tariffs with reporters ahead of trumps speech, said the taxes would raise hundreds of billions of dollars annually in revenues. they said the 10 baseline rate existed to help ensure compliance, while the higher rates were based on the trade deficits run with other nations and then halved to reach the numbers that trump presented in the rose garden. in a follow-up series of questions by the associated press, the white house could not say whether the tariff exemptions on imports worth 800 or less would remain in place, possibly shielding some imports from the new taxes. based on the possibility of broad tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most outside analyses by banks and think tanks see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnating growth. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress . president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. how will trumps tariffs work? how soon until prices might rise?apr. 2, 2025, 854 p.m. trump has blunt words on possible car price hikes amid new tariffsmar. 31, 2025, 956 a.m. because trump had hyped his tariffs without providing specifics until wednesday, he provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. powered by

  Title: Senior Trump officials give conflicting lines on tariffs after markets turmoil
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-06 17:37:32)
  Content: senior officials within donald trumps administration officials gave conflicting messages on sunday about the us presidents global tariffs that have caused a meltdown in stock markets, prompted warnings of a world recession and provoked rare expressions of dissent from within his republican party. cabinet members fanned out across sundays political talk shows armed with talking points on trumps 10 across-the-board tariff on almost all us imports, with higher rates targeted at about 60 countries. if the intention was to calm nerves with a clear statement of intent, then it backfired as top officials gave starkly contrasting signals. howard lutnick, the billionaire commerce secretary, struck an aggressive note on cbs newss face the nation in which he portrayed the tariffs as here to stay. asked whether there was a chance that tariffs would be postponed to allow countries to negotiate a deal with washington, he replied there is no postponing they are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks, that is sort of obvious. lutnick added that trump intended to reset global trade. the president has made it crystal, crystal clear, he said. however, two other cabinet members gave the opposite take, suggesting that negotiations with individual countries were very much on the cards. scott bessent, the treasury secretary, told meet the press on nbc news that trump had created maximum leverage for himself, and more than 50 countries have approached the administration about lowering their non-tariff trade barriers, lowering their tariffs, stopping currency manipulation. the agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, echoed bessent by flagging up possible talks. weve got 50 countries that are burning the phone lines into the white house, she told cnns state of the union. the scale of trumps tariffs have sent shockwaves around the world, catching us investors as well as top republican politicians by surprise. in just two days last week, more than 6tn was wiped off wall streets market value. trump told us consumers in a post on his truth social network to hang tough, it wont be easy, but the end result will be historic. yet as he spent the weekend golfing at his mar-a-lago resort in florida, his unprecedented tax increase goaded senior republicans to speak out, in a vanishingly rare display of criticism of their leader. trumps former vice-president, mike pence, denounced the tariffs as the largest peacetime tax hike in us history. thom tillis, the republican senator from north carolina, said anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right needs to talk to farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy. ted cruz, a senator from texas, warned of a bloodbath for republicans in the 2026 midterm elections should the tariffs force the us into recession. democrats are detecting opportunity in such unusual challenges to trump from within his own party. adam schiff, the democratic senator from california, floated on meet the press what sounded like a draft campaign strategy for the midterms. if we head into a recession, it will be the trump recession, he said. of trump, schiff also said hes wrecking our economy. tim walz, the governor of minnesota who ran as the democrats vice-presidential candidate in last novembers defeat to trump, called the tariffs really, really terrifying on state of the union. he warned that if you punish dependable trading partners like mexico and canada, they dont come back overnight. as the tariffs kick in, analysts are increasingly pointing to the chances of a recession, which is normally assessed as being two consecutive quarters of falling gdp. the head of economic research at jp morgan, bruce kasman, has raised the probability of global recession to 60, a figure that he included in a memo titled there will be blood. larry summers, the us treasury secretary during bill clintons presidency, called the tariffs the biggest self-inflicted wound weve put on our economy in history. speaking on abc newss this week, he gave his own estimate of the total loss to us consumers at 30tn equivalent to doubling petrol prices at the pump. skip past

attempted to use rhetorical devices as a way of assuaging rattled investors and consumers. rollins said the markets werent crashing they were adjusting. asked what he would say to americans close to retirement who had just watched their lifetime savings drop significantly in recent days, bessent called that a false narrative. americans who want to retire right now, they dont look at the day-to-day fluctuations of whats happening, bessent said. bessents answer was coloured, perhaps, by his own net worth, which has been put at more than 521m. there were moments of the surreal in the exchanges between trumps top officials and the political show hosts. asked by cnns jake tapper why 10 tariffs had been placed on heard island and mcdonald islands, which are populated by penguins near antarctica but no humans, rollins said i mean, come on, whatever. listen, the people that are leading this are serious, intentional, patriotic the smartest people ive ever worked with. tapper then pushed back on the agriculture secretarys justification for the 20 reciprocal tariffs that have been imposed on eu goods sold to the us. rollins said that honduras bought more pork from the us than the entire european union. tapper pointed out that the eu had tight restrictions on hormone use in livestock production. the eu banned use of synthetic hormones in 1981, and blocked imports of animals that had been treated in that way. rollins then accused the eu of using fake science to prohibit us products. thats just absolute bull, she said. we produce the safest, the most secure, the best food in the world.

  Title: Where Things Stand for Trump in Global Tariff Battle
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-10 15:43:06)
  Content: washington ap in the aftermath of this weeks tariff whiplash, president donald trump is deciding exactly what he wants out of trade talks with as many as 75 nations in the coming weeks. trump is also figuring out next steps with china. he upped his tariffs on chinese goods to 145 after china placed retaliatory taxes of 84 on imports from the u.s. while his 90-day pause on other tariffs caused the stock market to rally on wednesday, countries still face a baseline 10 import tax instead of the higher rates announced on april 2. there will be a transition cost and transition problems, trump said at wednesdays cabinet meeting. but in the end its going to be a beautiful thing. kevin hassett, director of the white house national economic council, told fox news fox and friends on wednesday that the administration already has offers on the table from more than 15 countries. hassett said the next step will be determining exactly what trump wants out of the negotiations. we have a meeting today with all the top principals where were going to present to the president a list of what we think his priorities might look like, hassett said. and im sure hes going to, you know, have his own ideas about where to move things. heres a look at where trumps tariffs showdown stands the financial markets can tame trump with 28.9 trillion in publicly held debt, the u.s. government can still be beholden to the investors who lend it money. trump might be willing to run roughshod over political rivals, judges he dislikes and a host of political norms, but the bond market showed wednesday that it can temper his plans. going into wednesday, the interest rate on a 10-year u.s. treasury note was increasing and approaching 4.5. that meant the u.s. government was having a tough time finding possible buyers for its debt, as market participants were wondering if trumps tariffs had caused foreign buyers to sour on the u.s. government. higher interest rates for the government could trigger even higher mortgage rates and auto loans for consumers, among other problems. trump on wednesday said investors were getting yippy, but after his tariff pause he described the bond market as beautiful. the tariff drama is far from done the sp 500 stock index jumped 9.5 after the pause was announced. but reality crept back in on thursday and the sp 500 slumped nearly 3.5 as interest rates on 10-year u.s. treasury notes rose. sure, trump was no longer going to put a 20 tariff on goods from the european union, a 24 tariff on japan or 25 on south korea. but those nations still have imports taxed at an elevated 10, trumps new baseline as trade talks begin. and tariffs went up against china, locking the worlds two largest economies in a trade war. plus, the trade war has expanded with china, and 25 tariffs still apply to imported autos, steel and aluminum. imports from canada and mexico, the two largest u.s. trading partners, still face import taxes of as much as 25. and trump still plans tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips. while we appreciate the pause, the reciprocal tariff of 10 still represents more than double the tariff on imports of leather footwear from countries like vietnam and cambodia, said tom florsheim, ceo of the weyco group, a footwear company. even at this level, it means a significant cost increase that will impact consumers. because tariffs are taxes paid by importers, the costs generally get passed along to consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices and slower economic growth. the budget lab at yale university estimated on thursday that even with the pause, trumps current tariff regime would pull down a households average disposable income by 4,364. what trump really, really wants treasury secretary scott bessent said that any trade agreements will be bespoke deals, rather than some overarching pact among a group of countries. trump has laid out a series of grievances and goals regarding tariffs, but canadian and european counterparts have said the actual asks from administration officials have been vague so far. trump has said he wants to eliminate the 1.2 trillion trade deficit, which means he no longer wants the u.s. to import more goods than it exports to other nations. he also wants revenues from tariffs to offset his income tax cut plans. the president has also said he wants the tariffs to bring back factory jobs and raise workers wages. aides have said that trump wants other nations to scrap regulations and other policies such as europes value-added taxes that he deems to be a barrier to u.s. goods, an ask that would require other countries to change their laws. commerce secretary howard lutnick has said the goal is to get other nations to respect trump. his goals might not necessarily be in line with what other nations want. european commission president ursula von der leyen posted on x that shes consistently advocated for a zero-for-zero tariff agreement between the european union and the united states. lori wallach, director of the rethink trade program at the american economic liberties project, said trump needs to be more publicly forthright about what he wants out of trade talks and tariffs. absent transparency about what is being demanded, we could end up with the worst of all outcomes a bunch of bad special interest deals, all of the economic damage caused by tariff uncertainty and no trade rebalancing, us manufacturing capacity or goods jobs, she said. a trade war with china could cause mutual pain the trump administration views china as violating basic trade norms with how it subsidizes its manufacturers, takes intellectual property from its global competitors, suppresses wages for its workers and manipulates its currency. the white house clarified that the 125 tariffs that trump announced on wednesday against china were actually 145, once his previous 20 fentanyl tariffs were included. census bureau data show the u.s. ran a 295 billion trade deficit last year with china. because u.s. consumers and businesses are such a major customer of chinese manufacturers, bessent has said that gives the u.s. an edge in terms of inflicting pain on that nations economy through tariffs. of course, china has also spent several years preparing for a trade war. trump at his cabinet meeting expressed hope that he could get an agreement with china, though he didnt offer any specifics on what he was seeking. well, well see what happens with china, trump said. i would love to be able to work a deal. wendong zhang, an economist at cornell university, said that the chinese economy might suffer a steeper hit to its gross domestic product than the u.s., but its likely to stick to its guns due to internal public support and the ability to increase consumption domestically on goods that might no longer be going to the u.s. meanwhile, trump will need to deal with voters who might be frustrated over the higher price of electronics and other goods resulting from the trade wars. many products that the u.s. imports are predominantly from china smartphones 73, laptops 78, video game consoles 87, toys 77, and also antibiotics for u.s. livestock production, zhang said in an email. resourcing from other countries will take time and result in much higher costs. 2025 the associated press. . this

to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters

afford it. donald trump is preparing to unveil a raft of new tariffs on wednesday afternoon in what the president has repeatedly billed as liberation day. trump has promised to roll out reciprocal dollar-for-dollar tariffs on nations that levy duties on u.s. goods as part of an aggressive attempt to fulfill his administrations america first agenda and correct years of what he deems unfair trade. international markets wait tentatively as the president is expected to unveil his plans at 4 p.m. wednesday at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden at the moment american markets close. plans remain under wraps with trumps team reportedly weighing options through tuesday. however, white house press secretary karoline leavitt stated that the president had already decided his course of action and that the tariffs would go into effect almost immediately. the only way to avoid the new levies, she said, is to move production to the u.s. it follows the liberal candidate for a critical seat on the wisconsin supreme court, susan crawford, who defeated conservative brad schimel in a race seen as a referendum on trump and his billionaire adviser elon musk. former republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is on board with an effort by democrats in the upper chamber led by senators tim kaine, amy klobuchar, and mark warner to end donald trumps made-up emergency that the president has declared against canada allowing him authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on the u.s.s northern neighbor. trump claims the authority by declaring a national emergency caused by the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migration from canada as well as mexico and china. president trump is saying that there is an emergency with canada. canada is a friend, not an adversary. canada is a sovereign nation, not a 51st state, senator kaine of virginia said on tuesday. this morning, cnns haley talbot reports that the list of republicans who will vote yes on a tariffs resolution up for a vote today at around 7 p.m. has grown to include the former gop leader of the senate. kaine said he approached mcconnell last night and didnt even get to the question before the kentucky senator said im with you. other republicans in support of the move to at least symbolically rebuke the president on his trade policy just a few hours after his liberation day announcement on reciprocal tariffs expected to cover a large swathe of u.s. trading partners include senators susan collins, lisa murkowski, and rand paul. senator thom tillis also told cnn that he doesnt plan on voting for kaines resolution, but has some concerns with the trade policies being discussed, adding, we need to see what comes out tomorrow wednesday and be instructed by that before we take action. earlier, trump wrote in part on truth social mitch mcconnell of kentucky, susan collins of maine, lisa murkowski of alaska, and rand paul, also of kentucky, will hopefully get on the republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize canada for the sale, into our country, of large amounts of fentanyl, by tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy. they are playing with the lives of the american people, and right into the hands of the radical left democrats and drug cartels. the senate bill is just a ploy of the dems to show and expose the weakness of certain republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the house will never approve it and i, as your president, will never sign it. after breaking the record for the longest senate speech in history, cory booker now seems to have broken the internet, with a slew of praise, memes and even tiktok videos commemorating his mammoth achievement. the new jersey democrat took to the senate floor on monday evening, saying he would remain there as long as he was physically able. the speech lasted a whopping 25 hours and 5 minutes. mike bedigan looks at some of the online reactions. it was fitting that cory booker was recounting a story about the late civil rights leader john lewis as he entered the 19th minute and 24th hour of a historic speech to the senate on tuesday evening. in that moment, the first black senator for new jersey broke a record for the longest speech ever made in congress, one that was set 67 years ago by the segregationist democrat strom thurmond, who spoke for a day and a night in opposition to the civil rights act. overcome with emotion, booker looked up to the ceiling and touched his heart as his fellow democrats in the chamber applauded his effort. one of msnbcs morning joe hosts is delighting in the fact that the wisconsin supreme court candidate backed by elon musks lost - even after the tech mogul dumped millions into the race. wisconsin voters elected liberal justice susan crawford to the states supreme court on tuesday, beating brad schimel by more than 200,000 votes in the most expensive judicial election in u.s. history. the vote keeps the high courts 4-3 liberal majority intact. musk repeatedly played up the stakes of the election, claiming it will direct the destiny of humanity and the future of the world is at stake. now, morning joe host joe scarborough is reveling in the massive loss musk suffered. katie hawkinson reports from washington, d.c. the u.s. has sent a three-person team to myanmar to help respond to the 7.7-magnitude earthquake, in a move criticized as weak and irrelevant by a former aid official. much larger russian and chinese teams have already been helping search-and-rescue efforts in the country for days. steffie banatvala reports. a mother and her three children were wrongfully detained by immigration enforcement agents in new york and taken to a detention facility in texas, a nonprofit says as it calls for their release. immigration and customs enforcement officers detained the mother - whose birth country was not disclosed - and her kids, one of whom is in third grade, on march 27 while they were executing an arrest on a farm in sackets harbor, new york, according to the new york immigration coalition. kelly rissman reports. elon musk broke his silence after suffering defeat in the wisconsin supreme court race, which cemented a liberal majority for the next three years. susan crawfords win keeps the court under a 4-3 liberal majority in the face of crucial litigation surrounding abortion access, voting rights and redistricting. like president donald trump, musk chose to focus on the background win of wisconsin voters approving the constitutional amendment to enshrine voter id laws, a vote that was being held at the same time as the supreme court race. this was the most important thing, musk posted on x in response to a post on voter id. madeline sherratt has the full story. kelly loeffler, former georgia senator and now head of the small business administration in the trump administration, hailed donald trumps liberation day as the single greatest salvation, for not just small businesses, but for america, during an appearance on fox business this morning. the president eagerly posted a clip of her conversation with maria bartiromo to his truth social account italys prime minister giorgia meloni and the countrys top business lobby warned on wednesday that impending u.s. tariffs could significantly impact the nations exports and its already struggling economy. it is clear that the introduction of new tariffs would have heavy repercussions for italian producers, meloni said while hosting a prize-giving ceremony for italian cuisine in rome. meloni added that she did not rule out adequate responses to protect the exports of the euro zones third largest economy, though she did not provide further details. italy recorded a trade surplus with the united states of 39 billion euros 42.14 billion in 2024, the third largest in the 20-nation euro area, according to eurostat data. earlier on wednesday, the business association confindustria reported that italys economy is expected to grow by 0.6 this year, half of the governments official target and down from a 0.9 forecast made by the group in october. the economy expanded by a modest 0.7 in both 2024 and 2023. it managed to achieve 0.1 growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the previous three months, after stagnating in the third quarter. most analysts do not foresee any significant rebound in the near term. confindustria indicated that while its forecasts accounted for the already-announced u.s. tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as what it termed record levels of uncertainty regarding trade policy, they did not consider the effects of an escalating trade war. in a worst-case scenario, with permanent 25 u.s. tariffs on all imports, rising to 60 for china, coupled with retaliatory measures against u.s. exports, italys growth could decline to around 0.2 this year, it said. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

The IMF's revised growth forecasts, triggered by Trump's tariffs and subsequent retaliatory measures, demonstrate how states prioritize relative gains and security, even at the expense of absolute economic benefits.

  Title: Spain Unveils $15.7 Billion Plan to Soften Blow From US Tariffs
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-03 10:16:25)
  Content: by david latona and corina pons madrid reuters -spain on thursday was one of the few major economies to offer up a concrete solution to help weather the impact of new u.s. tariffs, offering its companies a financial package of loans and direct aid worth 14.1 billion euros 15.66 billion. the tariffs announced by u.s. president donald trump on wednesday have rattled markets and drew condemnation from world leaders facing an abrupt end of an era of trade liberalisation that has shaped the global order for decades. spain, which like other european union members was hit by u.s. tariffs of 20 imposed on imports from the bloc, is the worlds top exporter of olive oil and sells important quantities of auto parts, steel and chemicals to the united states. sanchez described trumps actions as terrible news for the world, unintelligent and a return to 19th-century protectionism. this tariff attack by the u.s. administration makes no distinction between friends and enemies, it doesnt discriminate based on ideology or trade balance its against everyone and everything, he said. sanchez also stressed europes need to find new trading partners elsewhere. he is set to visit vietnam and china next month, attempting to forge closer economic ties with the asian countries. direct aid and soft loans spains aid package - which still needs to be approved by a fragmented parliament - will include 7.4 billion euros in new financing, and the rest will come from existing instruments such as soft loans, sanchez said. he said that 5 billion euros of eu recovery funds would be repurposed to help industries hurt by the tariff shock - such as auto suppliers - reorient their productive capabilities towards other high-demand sectors. the government will also contribute with 2 billion euros worth of credit insurance and export risk coverage. rafael pico, head of the spanish association of olive oil exporters asoliva, welcomed the measures and said the aid would help the industry invest in improving production processes and finding new markets. but he also called on the government to negotiate a reduction in the 20 tariff to align with competitors from other countries that were handed a lower rate. spain exports 180,000 tonnes of olive oil directly to the u.s. while another 180,000 tonnes are sold to germany, italy, belgium and britain before being packaged for export to the u.s., pico said. well see how effective the measures are, but they dont solve the problem of tariffs in a market that is irreplaceable for us, he said. the aid package from the spanish government will serve as a stop-gap so that the most exposed companies are not forced to shut down but it will not offset the loss of u.s. market share, said antonio gonzalez, an economist at the economists against the crisis think tank. trumps tariffs are so brutal that its very hard to see how theyll be compensated through soft loans or subsidies, gonzalez said. sanchez urged the european commission to set up a fund financed by revenues from tariffs on imports from the u.s. that are set to be hiked this month in response to washingtons move that he said was unfriendly and unjustified. spain has sought eu authorisation to allow more flexibility for large-scale domestic aid for the affected sectors. sanchez said he would use a labour law provision similar to a furlough scheme implemented during the covid-19 pandemic to allow the hardest-hit companies to maintain their workforce until they recover. well take advantage of this trade war to give our industry a new impulse for its modernisation and internationalisation, sanchez said. 1 0.9006 euros additional reporting by inti landauro, jesus aguado and emma pinedo writing by charlie devereux editing by andrei khalip, tomasz janowski and ed osmond 2025 thomson reuters.

  Title: World braces for 'Liberation Day' as Trump set to reveal sweeping tariffs
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-02 10:00:13)
  Content: markets and foreign capitals have braced themselves for a broad set of tariffs from president trump on wednesday, anxious for details on a dramatic shift in u.s. trade policy that is expected to supercharge the costs of cars, houses and everyday goods for americans. it is unclear whether the trump administration plans to impose a universal, baseline rate for import taxes on trading partners, or to customize tariff policy to each foreign nation, imposing reciprocal rates on a case-by-case basis. it is also unclear whether there will be any exceptions. a white house official told the times that exact details of the plan are still being perfected. the lack of clarity has rattled markets in recent weeks, driving the worst first annual quarter in three years and erasing gains on the standard poors 500 index made since trumps election victory in november. the white house said trump would announce his plans at 1 p.m. pacific time on wednesday, precisely when closing bells ring on wall street. after that, the new policy will be effective immediately, white house press secretary karoline leavitt told reporters at a tuesday news briefing. costs could rise immediately on perishable goods caught in limbo at international ports, including avocados and pineapples, said sung won sohn, a former commissioner at the port of los angeles. prices on larger items with dwindling inventories, such as foreign cars and washing machines, are likely to rise within weeks. lumber is stacked outside at the milan lumber co. in milan, n.h. robert f. bukaty associated press for los angeles, in particular, the tariffs are coming at a very bad time, sohn said. were in kind of bad shape, because you need a lot of lumber to rebuild from the fires, and the construction hasnt started yet. itll probably start in three to four months, and thats exactly when were going to be hit by higher prices for lumber. top european union leaders have alluded to potent retaliation that could extend beyond american whiskey and hit directly at silicon valley, core to the u.s. and californian economy. and californias agricultural economy the nations largest could become a target as well. retaliatory tariffs are expected to come from nations across the world affected by the new rates, risking further response from the trump administration, thus prompting a spiral into a trade war with few winners. leaders in canada, the second largest u.s. trading partner, have said ottawa will react swiftly to any new tariff actions. but mexican president claudia sheinbaum suggested tuesday that her administration will not retaliate immediately if washington slaps new taxes on mexican imports. we dont believe in an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, because that always leads to a bad situation, sheinbaum told journalists at her daily news conference. mexican president claudia sheinbaum addresses supporters at a march 9, 2025, rally at the zocalo, mexico citys main square. eduardo verdugo associated press instead, she called for further negotiations with the u.s., even while acknowledging that she has no plans to speak to trump in the coming days. the dialogue must continue, sheinbaum said. its not a matter of you put that, so ill put that, but rather whats best for mexico. shorter-term pain trumps advisors say the new policy will bring about an overdue correction, returning fair trade practices, ultimately raising significant revenue for the federal government and bringing back manufacturing to u.s. shores. it is, in many ways, the culmination of a years-long campaign by trump to increase tariffs going back to the 1980s, when as a real estate developer and celebrity, he accused japan and china of laughing at and ripping off the united states. in his address to a joint session of congress on march 4, trump complained that countries across the globe place tariffs on u.s.-made goods. on average, the european union, china, brazil, india, mexico, and canada have you heard of them? and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. its very unfair, he said. in his first term, trump negotiated a detailed trade deal, the united states-mexico-canada agreement, that replaced the north american free trade agreement and governed trade practices among the united states and its closest trading partners. susano cordoba sells peanuts to truck drivers lining up in tijuana to cross the border into the united states on march 4, 2025. gregory bull associated press but since resuming office in january, trump has repeatedly threatened new rounds of tariffs on mexican and canadian goods, often retreating from his plans at the last moment. the on-again, off-again threat of tariffs have contributed to the instability jolting stock markets, which closed on tuesday slightly up after a day of volatile trading. allies of the white house have acknowledged that short-term pain can be expected for u.s. households in the wake of the new policy implementation, which trump has referred to as liberation day. theres absolutely going to be short-term pain, republican sen. tim sheehy of montana told cnn on monday. the presidents been clear about that. everyone has. if youre going to remodel your house to make it better in the end, its going to be really annoying in the short term, when your house is getting remodeled and theres drywall dust everywhere and theres workers in your living room, sheehy added. the reality is that remodels got to happen in order to make things stronger and more stable in the back end. already, american consumers have begun to cut back on their spending and boost their savings. a friday report from the bureau of economic analysis , a government agency, showed that the personal savings rate rose 4.6 in february. consumer spending increased just .4, after decreasing by .3 in january. leavitt added tuesday that many countries have been calling the president, asking for relief from the anticipated tariffs. she said the president is open to taking their calls. its simple if you make your product in america, you will pay no tariffs, leavitt said. it is unclear how the administration will measure the success of the new tariffs. leavitt called the stock market, which has experienced volatility in recent weeks over tariff turmoil, a snapshot in time. the white house has repeatedly pointed to companies that have newly invested in the u.s. since trump took office as evidence of tariffs working. a pause on other 25 tariffs against canada and mexico is also set to expire tuesday, and the white house would not confirm whether it would be lifted. trumps announcement comes the same day that 25 tariffs were set to take effect on auto imports at 1201 a.m. wednesday. times staff writer kate linthicum in mexico city contributed to this report.

  Title: ‘In economic terms, Trump’s tariffs make no sense at all’ - The Guardian
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-04 16:16:23)
  Content: presidents move has no historic parallels, but the deep uncertainty for the global economy may prove as destructive as the tariffs from world leaders, to the tiniest manufacturers thousands of miles from washington, decision-makers across the global economy are racked with uncertainty as they scramble to come to terms with donald trumps historic tariffs. experts are all but unanimous that the impact on global growth of wednesdays extraordinary rose garden press conference will be negative but just how bad remains highly uncertain. in economic terms, it makes no sense at all, said jordi gual, the former chair of caixabank, spains largest domestic lender, who is now an economics professor at iese business school in barcelona. it is hugely problematic, because we go back to a level we hadnt seen since the 1930s. trumps announcement that he would impose tariffs of 10 to almost 50 on the uss largest trading partners including a 34 additional border tax on chinese imports and a 10 levy on the uk was designed to encourage multinational companies to relocate their factories, jobs and supply chains to the us. the president promised it would usher in a new golden age, but financial markets responded with a jarring two-day sell-off, underlining the potential risks of such an unprecedented policy, which is expected to increase prices in the us, and weaken growth worldwide. the aggregate effects will depend on several factors, including how successful governments are in negotiating carve-outs from the tariffs and how the us currency responds. typically, economists would predict that the dollar would strengthen as a result of the tariff spree, cushioning the impact on us consumers in terms of higher prices but the greenback has weakened on foreign exchange markets since trumps announcement. that could exacerbate the situation by unleashing even more inflation than is already likely from higher import taxes, and complicating the task of the federal reserve in battling any slowdown in growth. the us central bank may be reluctant to cut rates in the face of rocketing prices. the ability of monetary policy to be the shock absorber may be more limited now because of the price impact of tariffs, and the stickiness of inflation, said gerard lyons, the chief economist strategist at netwealth. the scope for spending policy to offset any potential slowdown with tax cuts to boost demand, for example also looks constrained inside and outside the us, with many countries already struggling with the debt hangover from covid. another important factor driving the scale of the hit to growth is how aggressively us economic rivals hit back, with tit-for-tat tariffs likely to make a bad situation worse. part of the answer emerged on friday, when beijing announced that instead of a forensically targeted response, it would simply slap 34 tariffs on all us imports. markets plunged. researchers at the oxford economics consultancy predicted trumps measures could knock global gdp growth to below 2 this year, the weakest rate since the 2008 financial crisis, excluding the pandemic. after global growth of 3.2 in 2024, such an outcome would mark a significant decline, but would fall short of a global recession which economists view as gdp growth falling short of the 0.9 rate of world population growth. suggestions that the entire global trading system will be brought to a halt look wide of the mark, however. although the us has lengthy supply chains stretching into vital overseas markets, trade still stands as a relatively small proportion of its overall 30tn economy and as much as 80 of global trade in goods does not directly touch the us, according to research from the boston consulting group. although were focused on the us being the largest economy, and the largest importer, things have changed from 10, 20, 30 years ago, said butler. if you compare this with going back to the early 1970s, when nixon took the dollar off the gold standard and imposed a temporary 10 tariff on trade, the us was vastly more important then. the impact on countries will vary significantly, depending on the level of tariffs they face, and how reliant they are on exports to the us, and on trade more broadly. sign up to business today get set for the working day well point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion analysts at the capital economics consultancy reckon eu growth may be 0.25 lower as a result of the 20 levy its exports face, and chinese growth perhaps 0.75 lower, for example. they suggest the uk, which was not in trumps sights because it does not have a major trade surplus with the us and so faces the minimum 10 tariff, will not be among the worst hit. in the uk, the effect on growth is still a rounding error its 0.1, said capitals chief economist, neil shearing. it hits exporters in particular sectors but it doesnt necessarily hit the uk economy as a whole. for some economies in the global south facing eye-wateringly high tariffs, however, and with little negotiating power, the effects could be devastating. cambodia faces 49 tariffs, laos 48 and vietnam 46. back on trumps doorstep, in the medium term, experts say a radically more protectionist us is likely to be less competitive and more expensive and may encourage other economies to forge deeper trading links between each other. you have a doughnut, where the us is an island surrounded by tariffs of 10-60, while the rest of the world goes its own way, says creon butler, who leads the global economy and finance programme at chatham house, in london. look at how the soviet union performed in a state of autarky economic isolationism. if you do have this us island economy, you will have poorer quality, more expensive products, and international supply chains going elsewhere. economists fret that in the immediate future uncertainty itself is having a dampening effect which could end up as damaging as the tariff policy itself. gual said some people argue hes playing the madman strategy. or some sort of random behaviour so that rivals, enemies, cannot anticipate his next move. maybe that in geopolitics has some role. but in economics that increases the level of uncertainty and it is not supportive of economic growth and financial stability. how many thousands of individual businesses and consumers respond in the coming days and weeks, will be critical in determining the impact of liberation day. do multinationals rapidly reshape their supply chains or hold back from investment while they wait to see if trump changes his mind? and does the us consumer keep on spending, or balk against rising prices? as shearing said the issue is that not only is it, where does the tariff policy land, but the range of different outcomes is extremely wide. as economists, we dont have the tools to deal with the human side of economics and there really are no historical parallels.

journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. britain must prepare for the worst from new import tariffs, the foreign secretary david lammy said yesterday as the world awaits the start of donald trumps trade war. the united states president has threatened to impose fees of 20 per cent or more on imports from around the world with immediate effect in measures expected to be announced on wednesday which he has dubbed liberation day. global market jitters continued over the potential impact of a trade war, as one study estimated it could cost the world 1.1 trillion. in britain alone, 25,000 jobs are at risk according to the institute of public policy research ippr, which said the new white house trade policy would completely destabilise the uk car manufacturing industry. meanwhile, goldman sachs analysts expected britains gdp to suffer a greater hit than previously feared even if a uk trade deal were agreed, due to larger negative spillovers from tariffs levied against the european union. as a result, the bank now expects 0.8 per cent of uk growth this year and 1.2 per cent in 2026 down from 0.9 and 1.3 respectively. chancellor rachel reeves told a cabinet meeting that there would be a serious impact from the tariffs. and while business secretary jonathan reynolds tried to be optimistic about the prospect of a uk-us deal, he was unable to give a timeline on when one might be completed. ministers were also forced to deny the trump administration was making demands about free speech in the uk as part of any potential trade deal. mr trump has previously announced a 25 per cent tax will be introduced on all cars imported to the us. he has also announced similar tariffs on steel and aluminium. however, the announcement on wednesday is expected to be far more wide-ranging. as the world braces for the impact, ireland warned it could lose up to 80,000 jobs under a worst-case scenario. in the house of commons, mr lammy said intense conversations were still taking place on a possible economic agreement. liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesperson calum miller asked if britain should enter talks with the eu on a customs union to soften the blow of tariffs. mr lammy replied its hugely important at this time that we continue the intense conversations were having with the us administration on getting an economic agreement but of course we prepare for the worst all options remain on the table, as the prime minister indicated. earlier, tory leader kemi badenoch had admitted she has not tried to use her relationship with senior white house figures, such as vice-president jd vance, to avoid tariffs. researchers at the ippr warned that employees at jaguar land rover and mini are some of the most exposed to a potential trade war. some 16.9 per cent of uk car exports were to the us last year, representing a total of more than 101,000 units worth 7.6bn. ippr research fellow pranesh narayanan said trumps tariffs have huge potential to completely destabilise the uk car manufacturing industry, affecting tens of thousands of jobs and putting the governments growth plans in jeopardy. meanwhile, a new study from the aston business school in birmingham estimates a global trade war could cost 1.4 trillion 1.1 trillion. the research maps six escalating scenarios, starting with us tariffs on canada, mexico and china, through to full global retaliation, with associated wider losses. earlier, sir keir starmer told sky news the likelihood is there will be tariffs. nobody welcomes that. we are obviously working with the sectors most impacted at pace on that. nobody wants to see a trade war but i have to act in the national interests. he said he hoped the deal being negotiated with the us would mitigate the tariffs. asked if he had been played by mr trump amid his efforts to build a good relationship, the prime minister said the us is our closest ally. our defence, our security, our intelligence are bound up in a way that no two other countries are. so its obviously in our national interest to have a close working relationship with the us, which weve had for decades, and i want to ensure we have for decades to come. he said talks on an economic deal would normally take months or years but in a matter of weeks we have got well advanced in those discussions. the pm is willing to offer us big tech firms a large tax cut in a bid to avoid tariffs, according to the guardian. the uk government is said to be considering reducing the headline rate of its digital services tax dst and to broaden its scope to include companies from other countries, a move which would represent a significant concession to us tech firms. the tax currently imposes a 2 per cent levy on tech firms, including us giants such as amazon, meta, alphabet, ebay and apple and generates about 800m a year. if it is lowered and applied to other countries it could satisfy mr trump, who has complained about the impact that dsts are having on us firms. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Trump warned US economy to be hit hardest by tariff war: Live updates - The Independent
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 15:31:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Realism, one might interpret the trade policy discussions as reflecting a state-centric view where national economic gain is prioritized, potentially at the expense of global stability. The text notes the 'aggressive tariff plans' and the claim that they 'would produce great benefits for american workers' while simultaneously acknowledging the negative impact on 'nearly all countries' and the risk of 'global recession'. This aligns with a realist perspective where states pursue self-interest in a competitive international system, viewing economic interactions through a zero-sum lens.; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory appears relevant in examining how specific issues gain prominence. The article highlights media reports (NBC News, Bloomberg, BBC) focusing on the Hegseth information leak and the economic consequences of tariffs, alongside official statements (Leavitt on student loans, Vance on tariffs, Bessent on China). This suggests that the selection and emphasis of these topics by both media and officials shape the public agenda, potentially diverting attention from or amplifying certain narratives over others.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents conflicting or potentially erroneous naming conventions for administration officials. Textual Basis: It refers to a 'press secretary karoline hegseth' and later 'white house press secretary karoline leavitt', and mentions 'treasury secretary scott bessent' immediately after discussing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a way that could cause confusion. Significance: Such inconsistencies, if not simple typos, could suggest reporting errors or a lack of clarity in official communication, potentially impacting the perceived reliability of the information presented. Probing Questions: Are these naming variations indicative of reporting inaccuracies, and how might such details influence a reader's trust in the overall narrative? What does the juxtaposition of the Defense Secretary and Treasury Secretary discussions imply about the article's structure or underlying connections the author perceives?

fund, told the bbc on tuesday. the u.s. economy will be one of the hardest hit by the aggressive tariff plans, the imf warned earlier in the day as it slashed forecasts for global economic growth, with the u.s. dropping to just 1.8 percent, from a previous forecast of 2.7 percent. the global economic growth forecast was cut by half a percentage point, with downgrades in nearly all countries amid ongoing uncertainty from the trump administrations trade policy. this came after vice president jd vance admitted that president donald trumps aggressive tariff increases will profoundly change the u.s. economy and other nations. in a speech in india, vance said the rebalancing from aggressive tariffs would produce great benefits for american workers. earlier, gold prices surged to a record high while the value of the u.s dollar plunged, following trumps latest attack on the federal reserve chair jerome powell. press secretary karoline hegseth was asked about embattled defense secretary

owe money. if you take out a loan, you have to pay it back very simple, leavitt said. defense secretary pete hegseth pulled the airstrike information he posted into signal chats with his wife, brother and dozens of others from a secure communications channel used by u.s. central command, raising new questions as to whether the embattled pentagon head leaked classified information over an open, unsecured network. nbc news first reported that the launch times and bomb drop times of u.s. warplanes that were about to strike houthi targets in yemen details that multiple officials have said is highly classified were taken from secure u.s. central command communications. a person familiar with the second chat confirmed that to the associated press. press secretary karoline leavitt confirmed

if president donald trump doesnt retreat on his tariffs, the chance of a u.s. recession and subsequent global recession is almost 100 percent. rogoff was speaking to bbc radio 4s pm programme in the u.k. today. defense secretary pete hegseth doubled down during a tuesday morning fox and friends interview, insisting that the information on airstrike launches and bomb drop times that he shared with his wife, brother, and dozens of others in two separate signal chats was not classified. hegseth didnt deny the existence of a separate chat instead, he attacked the media and his former staff, whom he accused of leaking information about the chats. his repeat denial comes as nbc news reported tuesday that the information hegseth posted came directly from secure communications from the head of u.s. central command, gen. erik kurilla. the pentagons inspector general is investigating the chats. the material kurilla sent included details about when u.s. fighters would take off and when they would hit their targets details that could, if they fell into the wrong hands, put the pilots of those fighters in grave danger. but he was doing exactly what he was supposed to providing hegseth, his superior, with information he needed to know and using a system specifically designed to safely transmit sensitive and classified information. but then hegseth used his personal phone to send some of the same information kurilla had given him to at least two group text chats on the signal messaging app, three u.s. officials with direct knowledge of the exchanges told nbc news. the sequence of events, which has not previously been reported, could raise new questions about hegseths handling of the information, which he and the government have denied was classified. in all, according to the two sources, less than 10 minutes elapsed between kurillas giving hegseth the information and hegseths sending it to the two group chats, one of which included other cabinet-level officials and their designees and, inadvertently, the editor of the atlantic magazine. one of them was composed of hegseths wife, brother and attorney and some of his aides. treasury secretary scott bessent told a

chase event on the sidelines of the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings in washington, d.c. he added that negotiations between the u.s. and china have not yet started but that a deal is possible, according to people who attended his session, which wasnt open to the public or media. u.s. stocks rose after his comments, with the sp 500 index gaining as much as 2.9 as of 1228

  Title: Trump Is Defiant as Tariff Moves Roil Markets a Second Day
  Source: www.nytimes.com (2025-04-04 23:50:21)
  Content: two days after president trump announced his expansive global tariffs, the united states confronted wide-ranging and painful blowback, as china retaliated against american goods and markets plummeted again on worries of a persistent, damaging trade war. no portion of the global economy appeared unscathed as the world braced for mr. trump to begin imposing his nearly across-the-board taxes on imports saturday, marking the first salvo in a potentially costly trade conflict that the president has vigorously defended. china, which mr. trump has already hit with 20 percent tariffs, announced plans to retaliate. beijing promised to impose a 34 percent tariff on american goods next week, including on agricultural products. china calibrated its tariffs to match mr. trumps decision to add a 34 percent tax to chinese imports. the tit-for-tat delivered a huge blow to financial markets, as wall street reckoned with the rising odds of an escalating global trade standoff. by the closing bell, the sp 500 had fallen by almost 6 percent, pulling it closer into a bear market, a widely used wall street term for a decline of at least 20 percent from its peak. the tech-heavy nasdaq fell 5.8 percent, pushing it into bear market territory. as china took aim at the united states, ngozi okonjo-iweala, the director general of the world trade organization, warned on friday against a cycle of retaliatory measures that lead to further declines in trade. in the united states, jerome h. powell, the chair of the federal reserve, struck his own downbeat note over the unpredictable trajectory of the economy. while uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected, mr. powell said. the same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth. but mr. trump responded to the day of chaos by striking a defiant tone. having decamped from washington to mar-a-lago, his home in florida, he declared on truth social my policies will never change. instead, the president insisted in another post that his strategy was already working, as he held up a newly released and better-than-expected jobs report, which reflected u.s. hiring increased in the month before the announcement of his tariffs. at one point, the president even circulated another users video that argued trump is purposely crashing the market, in a bid to force the fed to lower interest rates. he later called on mr. powell to do just that, demanding that the independent chair of the central bank stop playing politics. and mr. trump eventually turned his attention to china, attacking the country for having played it wrong by retaliating against the united states. the president and his aides previously have signaled they could ratchet up their tariff rates if other nations look to exact retribution on u.s. goods. the global scramble in many ways underscored the weight of mr. trumps tariffs and the significance of his grand aspirations to recalibrate the global trading system. the white house sees these levies as critical toward resetting u.s. trade relationships, which the president contends are unfair, while boosting u.s. manufacturing and raising new revenue. but the tariffs, which are taxes on imports, threaten to fall hard on businesses that could face new costs to produce their goods. that, in turn, could hammer consumers, who are likely to shoulder the burden of any price increases. economists widely believe the result could be a rising rate of inflation, and a slowdown in consumer spending and business investment, which together crimp u.s. growth and push the economy into a recession. markets are expressing a vote of no confidence in the new tariff regime, said joe brusuelas, the principal and chief economist at the consulting firm rsm. he added that mr. trumps commentary on friday only adds to the consternation and concern that theres no strategic road map. but mr. trump and his top aides have swatted away those dour projections in recent days. fanning across cable news, they have dismissed the ebb and flow of the markets and acknowledged the possibility that tariffs could create short-term economic pain, which the president has likened to a sick patients painful yet necessary medical operation. the administration and its conservative allies have also labored to deflect criticism from economists, repeatedly portraying them as naysayers who had wrongly judged the presidents agenda in the past. i think its very clear the rhetoric of the economic community, in particular, is almost entirely ideological and out of proportion to the actual sort of risk-reward calculation, oren cass, the chief economist at american compass, a conservative economic think tank, said friday. global leaders, american politicians and others rejected that view, saying mr. trumps approach threatened to weaken the global economy and send prices soaring just as much of the world was finally returning to a sense of balance after two years of rapid inflation. ms. okonjo-iweala, the director general of the w.t.o., warned in a statement friday that mr. trumps policies could lead to an overall contraction of around 1 percent in global merchandise trade volumes this year, representing a downward revision of nearly four percentage points from previous projections. the state of california signaled it would try to negotiate its own trade deals, as gov. gavin newsom, a democrat, looked to protect local agriculture and other businesses. in a statement, mr. newsom said the presidents tactics would be felt in pretty profound ways to real people, including those who voted for donald trump and are now being betrayed by this very administration. even video games could not escape the fray japans nintendo announced that it would delay presales of its widely anticipated upcoming console, the switch 2, as it cited a need to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. mr. trump has said japan will face a 24 percent tariff on its exports to the united states. some foreign governments also mounted a last-minute scramble to figure out how, or if, to retaliate, while trying to persuade washington to relax its coming taxes on imports. maros sefcovic, the trade commissioner for the european union, said friday that he had a frank exchange with mr. trumps trade emissaries, posting on the social-media site x, i was clear us tariffs are damaging, unjustified. earlier friday, mr. trump said he had spoken by phone with to lam, the general secretary of the communist party of vietnam, which stands to see a 46 percent tariff on its exports to the united states beginning next week. by mr. trumps telling, vietnam wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s., though the president did not explicitly say if he would accept such a deal. the trump administration has sent mixed signals over its willingness to cut a deal some of mr. trumps advisers have said they do not intend to haggle, but the president himself told reporters earlier in the week that he could be open to negotiation if the united states received something phenomenal in return for relaxing tariffs. reporting was contributed by ana swanson, laurel rosenhall, colby smith, zachary small and keith bradsher.

  Title: Trump threatens more tariffs on China as global markets shudder over how much pain economy can take
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-10 20:33:10)
  Content: follow live updates on the global markets washington ap undeterred by a panicked stock market, president donald trump threatened additional tariffs on china on monday, raising fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war. trumps threat came after china said it would retaliate against u.s. tariffs he announced last week. if china does not withdraw its 34 increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, april 8th, 2025, the united states will impose additional tariffs on china of 50, effective april 9th, trump wrote on truth social. additionally, all talks with china concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! the u.s. president has shown few signs of backing down on tariffs despite the mounting pressure in the financial markets. his commitment to tariffs could have devastating effects for the global economy, even though trump is banking that it will ultimately pay off with manufacturing jobs. asked monday if he would consider a pause on his widespread tariffs, trump said, were not looking at that. the u.s. president said he was open to negotiations if we can make a really fair deal and a good deal for the united states. trump added that its possible to have both negotiated settlements with other countries and permanent tariffs. even as israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said his country would take its tariffs against u.s. goods to zero, trump was noncommittal about removing the new import taxes placed on an ally. the white house also said monday that trump would veto a senate bill that would mandate congressional approval for new tariffs, a bet that the critical mass of republican lawmakers will loyally back him despite the economic and political risks. however, there are signs of frustration even among trumps allies. sen. john kennedy, a louisiana republican, said he supports the presidents goals of better trade deals but worries about the economic uncertainty. we dont know if the medicine will be worse than the disease, kennedy said, adding, this is president trumps economy now. if trump implements his new taxes on imports from china, u.s. tariffs on chinese goods would reach a combined 104. the new taxes would be on top of the 20 tariffs announced as punishment for fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34 tariffs announced last week. not only could that increase prices for american consumers, it could also give china an incentive to flood other countries with cheaper goods and seek deeper relationships with other trading partners. china responded angrily and said it would not back down. the u.s. threat to escalate tariffs on china is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the u.s., said a statement from the commerce ministry in beijing. china will never accept this. if the u.s. insists on its own way, china will fight to the end. after sell-offs on the prior two days of trading, the dow jones industrial average on monday fell 0.9. the sp 500 slumped 0.2, and the nasdaq composite was up 0.1. trump frequently bragged about stock market gains during his first term, and the threat of losses on wall street was viewed as a potential guardrail on risky economic policies in his second term. but that hasnt been the case, and trump has described days of financial pain as necessary. i dont mind going through it because i see a beautiful picture at the end, he said. trump officials have frequently appeared on television to make the case for his policies, but none of their explanations have calmed the markets. the only improvement came from a false report that top economic adviser kevin hassett said trump was considering a pause on all tariffs except for china. stock prices spiked before the white house denied it was true by calling the post fake news. the republican president has remained defiant despite fears that he could be pushing the u.s. toward a recession, insisting that his tariffs are necessary for rebuilding domestic manufacturing and resetting trade relationships with other countries. but his aggressive push has scrambled u.s. economic policy. even though inflation remains elevated, trump has called on the federal reserve to lower its benchmark interest rates that were increased to constrain price increases. federal reserve chair jerome powell warned friday that the tariffs could increase inflation, and he said, theres a lot of waiting and seeing going on, including by us, before any decisions would be made. european commission president ursula von der leyen said the european union would focus on trade with other countries besides the united states, saying there are vast opportunities elsewhere. trump said he spoke with japanese prime minister shigeru ishiba to start trade negotiations. he complained on truth social they have treated the u.s. very poorly on trade and they dont take our cars, but we take millions of theirs. ishiba said he told trump that hes strongly concerned that tariffs would discourage investment from japan, which has been the worlds biggest investor in the u.s. in the past five years. he described the situation as a national crisis and said his government would negotiate with washington to urge trump to reconsider the tariffs. white house trade adviser peter navarro suggested countries would need to do much more than simply lower their own tariff rates to reach deals, an indication that talks could be a drawn-out process. lets take vietnam, he said on cnbc. when they come to us and say, well go to zero tariffs, that means nothing to us because its the non-tariff cheating that matters. meeting with trump at the white house on monday, netanyahu said his country would remove tariffs and other trade barriers in response to the u.s. placing 17 taxes on imports from israel. israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same, netanyahu told the u.s. president. trump said he appreciated very much what netanyahu had said. but when asked if he would remove the tariffs, trump said maybe not because of the aid that the united states provides to israel. the u.s. had a 7.4 billion trade deficit in goods last year with israel, according to the census bureau. trump has strived for a united front after the chaotic infighting of his first term. however, the economic turbulence has exposed some fractures among his supporters. bill ackman, a hedge fund manager, assailed commerce secretary howard lutnick on sunday as indifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing. on monday, ackman apologized for his criticism claiming that lutnick, previously the head of the financial firm cantor fitzgerald, could benefit from the tariffs because of its bond investments. but the hedge fund manager also reiterated his concerns about trumps tariffs. i am just frustrated watching what i believe to be a major policy error occur after our country and the president have been making huge economic progress that is now at risk due to the tariffs, he wrote on x. billionaire elon musk, a top adviser to trump on overhauling the federal government, expressed skepticism about tariffs over the weekend. musk has said that tariffs would drive up costs for tesla, his electric automaker. i hope it is agreed that both europe and the united states should move ideally in my view to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between europe and north america, musk said in a video conference with italian politicians. navarro later told fox news sunday morning futures that musk doesnt understand the situation. he sells cars, navarro said. thats what he does. he added, hes simply protecting his own interests as any businessperson would do. ___ associated press writers didi tang and stephen groves in washington and mari yamaguchi in tokyo contributed to this report. ___ follow the aps coverage of

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
