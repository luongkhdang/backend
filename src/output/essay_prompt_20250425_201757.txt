  Title: Spain unveils €11bn plan to reach long-delayed Nato defence spending target
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-22 13:24:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: Spain's increased defense spending, spurred by pressure from NATO and the perceived threat from Russia ('vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security'), aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize their security in an anarchic international system. This action demonstrates a shift towards self-reliance and power balancing within Europe.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Spain's commitment to increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP, but also mentions criticism from coalition partners who describe the plans as 'incoherent and absolutely exorbitant.' This suggests internal political divisions regarding defense priorities and resource allocation. What are the specific concerns of the coalition partners, and how might these internal disagreements affect the implementation and effectiveness of the defense plan?

      > Snippet: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year
  Content: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year, saying it has become obvious only europe will know how to protect europe from now on. the country which lags well behind other western nations by dedicating about 1.3 of its gdp to defence spending is one of the nato members that has been pressured by the trump administration to increase its spending, and had previously committed to hitting the 2 threshold by 2029. but speaking on tuesday morning, spains prime minister, pedro sánchez, unveiled a 10.5bn 9bn industrial and technological plan for security and defence that will allow spain to meet the 2 commitment in 2025. sánchez said the plan, which has been approved by his cabinet and will now be submitted to the eu and nato, was needed to address the current and future defence challenges. its main focus will be telecommunications, cybersecurity and buying military equipment. the enemies of europe are not just using missiles as we have seen in ukraine over the past three years, he said. theyre also using unmanned drones and paramilitary forces to sabotage supply chains and to cut gas lines and underwater cables. theyre using social networks to issue disinformation and to polarise people and spread disaffection towards democratic institutions. theyre using ai cyber-attacks and quantum computers to compromise out telecommunications, our supply networks, and our public services in order to target our way of life. the prime minister who pointed out that his administration was finally making good on the 2 commitment pledged by its conservative predecessor in 2014 said the new plan would help reinforce european security in record time. in a world thats dominated by uncertainty, europe is hope and it is certainty and that certainty must be protected by strengthening our security and defence systems because given whats going on, its obvious that only europe will know how to protect europe, he added. and spain will contribute to protecting europe. sánchez said vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security, no matter how far any eu member state was from the frontlines of the conflict in ukraine. the security and stability of ukraine, of eastern europe and the baltic and nordic countries, is also the security and the safety of spain, he said. the people who live in those countries know that putin is serious and that his words are backed by deeds and thats why they look to europe for protection. theyre looking for something important, and that is unity. spain will not be indifferent to that demand. ukraine resists, europe responds and spain fulfils its obligations. sánchez also repeated his assurances that the additional spending would not lead to increased taxes, raids on the welfare state budget, or deficit increases. the plan has faced criticism from coalition partners in the leftwing sumar platform, who described the plans as incoherent and absolutely exorbitant. in january, donald trump increased pressure on nato, claiming the us had shouldered the global defence burden for too long and saying he would ask all nato members to increase defence spending to 5 of gdp. the nato secretary-general, mark rutte, has urged member states to use the threats from washington as an incentive to take unilateral action on raising defence contributions. last month, rutte said the pressure was already paying off in countries such as spain, portugal, belgium and italy. i tell them that, well, now i am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2 by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2 because we have to spend much, much more than 2 but now i am calling you, but you might get a very, erm, patient man from washington on the line if you dont listen to me, he said.

  Title: Is Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated (CORT) Among the Best Guru Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts?
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-23 17:17:07)
  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. we recently published a list of 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. in this article, we are going to take a look at where corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort stands against other guru stocks to invest in. wall street seems to be breathing a little easier after the initial panic over president trumps tariffs earlier this month, but the rollercoaster is not over just yet. all three major indexes closed last week in the red, with the dow and nasdaq both dipping over 2, and the broader market down more than 1. even though markets remain closed on april 18 for good friday, the general consensus is that the worst of the trade war headlines might be dying down. marko papic, chief strategist of geomacro strategy at bca research, remains cautiously optimistic, noting that while the idea of president trump striking 90 trade deals in 90 days sounds ambitious, they will likely be small, symbolic wins that still help calm markets. that said, volatility is expected to continue, and papic predicts the broader market could dip again before bouncing back, potentially giving investors a buying opportunity. investors are deep in earnings season right now, and some of wall streets biggest banks have reported solid first-quarter results. a big part of their success came from their trading desks, which cashed in on the recent market volatility, especially in equities. however, despite strong numbers on paper, bank ceos remain cautious and are hesitant to make big moves right now because of the market uncertainty. the us dollar also just had its worst weekly performance since 2022. meanwhile, investors are playing it safe and rapidly buying bonds, which pushed the 10-year treasury yield down to around 4.28. while some investors are seeing the current market dip as a buying opportunity, daniel von ahlen from globaldata ts lombard says otherwise. he believes the risks of a recession are being seriously underestimated. even though trumps recent tariff halt gave markets a bit of a boost, ahlen thinks that bounce will not last. in his view, this is not the time to scoop up stocks on the cheap, he is actually advising people to sell into rallies and avoid the usual buy-the-dip strategy. ahlen suggests getting a bit more cautious and selective. instead of jumping into the whole market, he recommends focusing on defensive sectors, like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare, that tend to hold up better in downturns. the market uncertainty is reflected in etfs as well, which are often considered wiser investment options due to active management strategies and lower risk compared to individual investing. for example, the guru etf is down 8.30 year-to-date as of april 18. however, over the last 12 months, the fund has posted share price returns of 13.38. similarly, five-year share returns stand at an impressive 51.57. guru gives retail investors a way to tap into the top stock picks of major hedge funds at a relatively low 0.75 expense ratio. it offers a more affordable and flexible way to try and beat the broader market using expert insights. so, lets take a look at the best guru stocks to buy. a biologist in a lab coat studying a culture of cells to find a cure for metabolic disorders. for this article, we looked up the guru etf, which had 82 holdings as of april 18. next, we manually searched for the average upside potential of each stock and selected 11 stocks with the highest values. the list below is ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of april 18. we have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment as of q4 2024. why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

  Title: SURVEY: Half Americans Have Given Up On Saving Money...
  Source: studyfinds.org (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights the prevalence of financial insecurity among Americans, influencing public perception and potentially shaping policy priorities. The repeated emphasis on savings shortfalls and reliance on savings for emergencies, "67 of americans feel theyre lagging behind their savings targets. even worse, 47 have completely given up hope," frames the issue as a widespread problem. This can lead to increased public concern and demand for solutions.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Gen Z's relatively high satisfaction with their banks (71%) but also their willingness to switch (45%). This juxtaposition is intriguing because it suggests a potential disconnect between perceived satisfaction and actual loyalty. What specific factors, beyond those mentioned, might be driving Gen Z's willingness to switch banks despite their reported satisfaction? Could this indicate a deeper dissatisfaction with certain aspects of banking services that aren't fully captured by the satisfaction metric?

  Title: Bank of England rate-setter says US tariffs likely to push down on inflation
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 11:13:59)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article touches upon aspects of Realism in international relations, specifically concerning trade and tariffs. The US imposing tariffs on the UK, as mentioned in the text ('the us has imposed a 10 import tariff on goods coming from the uk, a policy which also applies to many other countries'), exemplifies a state acting in its perceived self-interest to protect its economy, regardless of the impact on other nations. This action, and the UK's subsequent economic considerations, reflect the competitive and often conflictual nature of international trade relations as described by Realist theory.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents Megan Greene's analysis of potential disinflationary effects of US tariffs on the UK, but also acknowledges 'a tonne of uncertainty around this.' This uncertainty, coupled with the mention of 'both inflationary and disinflationary forces,' suggests a more complex and potentially volatile economic situation than a simple cause-and-effect narrative. What specific factors contribute most to this uncertainty, and how might they interact to produce unexpected economic outcomes?; Intriguing_angles: The opening section discusses the importance of 'parsing out the facts from the messaging' in the context of US politics, while the latter part focuses on economic analysis of UK inflation. This juxtaposition, while seemingly unrelated, could subtly imply that economic narratives are also subject to manipulation or biased framing. To what extent might political messaging influence the interpretation and presentation of economic data, and what mechanisms might facilitate such influence?

  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism is relevant here. The article illustrates how a shift in the U.S. administration's policies and rhetoric, specifically "steep trade tariffs" and "suggestions that canada should become a u.s. state," directly impacts Canada's economic and social well-being. This aligns with Realism's emphasis on states acting in their self-interest and the pursuit of power, leading to a competitive and sometimes conflictual international environment. The resulting "chill that has blanketed relations" and the economic consequences for both countries demonstrate the core tenets of Realist thought.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that some Canadians are "quietly preparing to let go of their second homes" but "holding back to see how things play out." This suggests a level of uncertainty and a potential for further shifts in behavior depending on future political developments. What specific political or economic indicators are these Canadians monitoring, and what threshold would trigger a more widespread exodus?; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the economic reliance of South Florida on Canadian snowbirds, stating they "either own property and pay property tax or rent for the winter months - either way, a boost to the economy." However, it doesn't quantify the overall economic impact or explore potential mitigation strategies. What percentage of South Florida's economy is directly attributable to Canadian snowbirds, and what alternative revenue streams are being considered to offset the potential loss?

making up 13 of all foreign transactions - more than any other nationality, according to data from the national association of realtors. nearly half of the homes purchased by canadians were for vacation purposes, with florida, arizona and hawaii ranking as the top markets. last week, tracy and dale mcmullen sold their vacation home in buckeye, arizona, a property they owned for five years. the alberta residents, who usually spend four to five months in arizona a year, said they are not planning to come back. we decided to sell the property after the current potus took office, said dale, referring to u.s. president donald trump, who was inaugurated for the second time in january. it was time to leave. we felt we could not trust what he might do next to us as individuals and to our country. we no longer felt welcome nor safe. canadians are feeling stung by the actions and words of the trump administration, which has imposed steep trade tariffs on its northern neighbor, threatening canadas export-dependent economy. trumps repeated suggestions that canada should become a u.s. state, and his derogatory references to now-former prime minister justin trudeau as governor have annoyed canadians and offended their national pride. as a result, many canadians are boycotting u.s.-made goods, such as bourbon and produce and canceling trips to u.s. destinations. canadian return flights from the u.s. fell 13.5 in march from a year earlier, according to statistics canada. canadian-resident return trips by automobile fell about 32. real estate is now facing a similar pullback in demand. laurie lavine, a realtor in arizona who helped the mcmullens with their sale, told reuters that he currently has 18 listings from canadians looking to sell, compared with the usual two to four per quarter. trade friction and the current weakness of the canadian dollar are also contributing to the pullback, lavine said. canadians are also feeling picked on, with u.s. border agents enforcing stricter rules on entering the country, he added. beginning this month, the trump administration is requiring all foreigners 14 or older to register and submit fingerprints if they stay beyond 30 days. canadians, who previously could visit for up to six months without a visa, are subject to the new requirement. the sour feelings that many canadians suddenly feel toward the u.s. are having a big impact on the property market in florida, one of the closest warm-weather states to ontario and quebec, canadas most populous provinces. south floridas residential market has for decades been reliant on the annual influx of canadian snowbirds who either own property and pay property tax or rent for the winter months - either way, a boost to the economy, said ermengarde jabir, a director of economic research at moodys analytics. the first quarter is typically the peak buying season for condominiums in the region, coinciding with when many snowbirds are in town, said andrea hartmann, managing partner of the sandy hartmann group, a real estate firm in the tampa bay area. since the beginning of the year we have not received an offer from a canadian buyer even once, and normally we would, she said. floridas housing market is already reeling. prospective buyers have faced rising insurance premiums, concerns over climate change and a series of devastating hurricanes in recent years. in the tampa-st. petersburg-clearwater region, mortgage lock volume for second homes - or the number of buyers securing rates ahead of purchases - fell 25 on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2025, according to optimal blue, a mortgage technology and data company. now with the political issue, the cost of maintaining a place here in florida and the insurance, a lot of them decided to sell and go, said ken obrian, owner of southwest coast realty in naples, which has specialized in helping canadians purchase properties in florida for about 20 years. there is no incentive to come to the states anymore, said donny b., a native of ontario who is looking to sell his two investment properties in florida. like many snowbirds interviewed for this story, he declined to give his surname, saying he feared backlash. he said he decided to sell because of the political uncertainty, the exchange rate and concern about whether floridians would still welcome canadians in the current climate. i got down here on wednesday and i was nervous. im like, are people going to be pissed off at me? other states have started to see an exodus as well. agents in los angeles and palm springs, california, are working with canadian sellers who are quietly preparing to let go of their second homes, said fatima malik, global real estate advisor at engel volkers beverly hills. some are holding back to see how things play out, but others are already shifting their sights toward places like portugal, mexico, and parts of france, she added. reporting by doyinsola oladipo in new york and mrinalika roy in bengaluru editing by frank mcgurty and paul simao

  Title: Dodgers collaborate with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami on merchandise again. Here's how to get it
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 11:00:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article highlights how the collaboration between Takashi Murakami and the Dodgers, along with the MLB Tokyo Series, successfully captured public attention. The text states, "the overall success of the tokyo series collection delighted murakami" and "i was surprised by the overwhelming response." This suggests that the media coverage and marketing efforts surrounding the event effectively placed it on the public's agenda, leading to increased interest and demand.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions the merchandise hitting the secondary market for four times the purchase price. This suggests a potential imbalance between supply and demand, and raises the question: Was the limited availability of the merchandise intentional to drive up prices and create hype, and if so, what are the ethical implications of such a strategy?; Intriguing_angles: The article notes Murakami's surprise at the overwhelming response in Japan, stating, "honestly, i had thought baseball wasnt as major a sport in japan these days." This suggests a potential disconnect between the artist's perception and the reality of baseball's popularity in Japan. What other assumptions might be influencing the collaboration, and how might these assumptions affect its long-term success?

  Content: a month ago, dodgers gear festooned with colorful flowers in the unmistakable designs of acclaimed japanese artist takashi murakami sold out in minutes at a pop-up on fairfax avenue. a couple hundred angelenos lined up overnight to purchase gear, generating 40 million. the pop-up, called the mlb tokyo series collection, preceded the two-game, season-opening series in japan between the dodgers and chicago cubs, and items soon hit the secondary market for four times the purchase price. the merchandise was so popular that murakami and the dodgers responded by approximating the famous words of hall of fame cubs shortstop ernie banks lets play two! a new collection presented by complex and fanatics will be available april 28 during japanese heritage night at dodger stadium and the dodger clubhouse store, then can be purchased only online. murakami, 63, will throw out the ceremonial first pitch as he did before an exhibition between the dodgers and yomiuri giants at the tokyo dome on march 15. its been two months since i started practicing for the first pitch in tokyo, but given my age, its not so easy to pick up new skills, murakami said playfully in an interview with the times. still, compared to the first day when i couldnt throw the ball at all, ive improved significantly. my hope this time is to throw the ball without it bouncing. some of the dodgers merchandise created in collaboration with japanese artist takashi murakami is shown. complex murakami is unquestionably adept with a brush, a pen or a computer, creating iconic art that features manga, anime, cartoons and brightly colored anthropomorphic cherry blossoms, mushrooms and assorted flowers. he began delivering commissioned projects for luxury brands and celebrities 20 years ago, and a financial pinnacle came in 2008 when his provocative life-size figure my lonesome cowboy sold for 15.1 million at auction. since then murakami has integrated his art on louis vuitton handbags, a kanye west album cover, and the kid cudi collaboration kids see ghosts. he also had a solo exhibition in 2022 at the broad titled takashi murakami stepping on the tail of a rainbow that included sculpture, painting, wallpaper and immersive installations. now his attention has turned to baseball. the mlb tokyo series collection had his familiar colorful flora sprinkled across jerseys, bats, balls, hoodies, flip-flops and a shohei ohtani bobblehead. the surprise medium might have been collaborating with topps on baseball cards. since 2023, i have been creating trading cards and trading card games with my team, so i felt i approached this project with a good understanding of the context, murakami said. but when we filmed the unboxing event for the topps complex series and tokyo series on youtube, i recognized anew how profound the world of american sports trading cards is, which shook me with excitement. the overall success of the tokyo series collection delighted murakami, who said he remembers playing catch with his father as a child. honestly, i had thought baseball wasnt as major a sport in japan these days, so i was surprised by the overwhelming response, he said. i received messages from childhood friends and was approached by neighbors afterwards, which made me realize that baseball remains the beloved sport among the japanese public. the addition of japanese megastars ohtani, yoshinobu yamamoto and roki sasaki made collaborating with the dodgers a natural. the teams popularity in japan has never been greater. the dodgers are the team hideo nomo joined when he first played major league baseball, overcoming various obstacles, murakami said. his success had a significant impact on japanese players entering the majors, and his achievements are vivid in my memory. shohei ohtani joining the dodgers feels like a fateful story for japanese baseball, and im deeply moved by it. in that sense, i consider myself a dodgers fan. murakami added that he has felt comfortable in l.a. since his exhibition at the museum of contemporary art in 2007-2008. i believe my career as an artist in the contemporary art world took off in los angeles, he said. the moca exhibition, curated by paul schimmel, was pivotal in establishing my career in america. whenever i visit los angeles, i feel a strong connection, as if its my second hometown, with fans saying hello to me around the city. so im especially grateful for this new relationship with the dodgers in los angeles.

  Title: Supreme Court hears clash over gay storybooks...
  Source: abcnews.go.com (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights how the Montgomery County school board's decision to include LGBTQ-themed storybooks in the curriculum has brought the issue of parental rights and religious freedom to the forefront of public discourse. The article states, "starting in 2022, montgomery county - one of the most diverse counties in the country - introduced a series of lgbtq-themed storybooks for reading in elementary school classrooms under a statewide mandate to be more inclusive of the diversity of families and children attending the schools." This action has set the agenda for debate, forcing the Supreme Court to address the conflict between religious beliefs and inclusive education.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the Trump administration "moves to empower parents and root out diversity and inclusion initiatives across the u.s. education system."

and that the constitution does not guarantee students the right to skip lessons inconsistent with their beliefs. lower courts sided with the board. the justices will now take a closer look at whether the countys refusal to grant an opt-out to parents illegally burdens their religious rights. school districts nationwide are grappling with demands from parents to opt-out their children from lesson plans they claim are counter to religious beliefs. abc news the case is a good illustration of the fact that public schools are at ground zero in the culture wars, said jim walsh, a texas lawyer who represents school boards and is a member of the national school attorneys association. we all want the school to reflect our values, but we dont agree on our values. and certainly issues about same-sex marriage, the rights of lesbians and gays, are right at the center of that, he said. starting in 2022, montgomery county - one of the most diverse counties in the country - introduced a series of lgbtq-themed storybooks for reading in elementary school classrooms under a statewide mandate to be more inclusive of the diversity of families and children attending the schools. montgomery county, md., is at the center of a supreme court battle over lgbtq storybooks and some parents claims of a constitutional right to opt-out their children from readings. abc news the local school board, which closely consulted with educators in approving the curriculum, maintains that the books do not take a side on issues of gender or sexuality and that teachers are instructed not to teach or enforce any particular view. among the illustrated titles is uncle bobbys wedding by sarah brannen, about a young girl who worries her close relationship with a beloved uncle will change after he marries his male fiance. prince knight by daniel haack presents a fairy-tale narrative about a blossoming romance between the main characters after a dramatic rescue from a dragon. daniel haack is the author of prince knight, an illustrated childrens book featuring gay characters. abc news nothing in my book is any different than most fairy tales that have some sort of romance at the center of it, said haack. nothing different than sleeping beauty or cinderella or any of those. in the book intersection allies, a group of three sociologist authors set out to simplify complex ideas about identity, including what it means to be nonbinary. we wrote this to affirm kids who are left out of the stories that we often tell, said latoya council, one of the authors. this book is not saying that, you know, your child has to choose to be transgender. its saying respect someone who is trans and their ability to seek spaces that are comfortable for them. three sociologists and authors of the childrens book intersection allies chelsea johnson, latoya council, carolyn choi speak with abc news about their desire to simplify complex ideas about identity. abc news chelsea johnson, another of the books authors, insisted nothing in the text asks anyone to change their beliefs. schools and parents and communities are partners with each other and helping kids make sense of the world and we dont have to opt our kids out to do that. montgomery county guidelines advise educators to make the storybooks available for students to read on their own, to read aloud, or share in reading groups. teachers are instructed not to advance a particular viewpoint about sexuality or gender with respect to the characters. at first, during the 2022-2023 school year, the board allowed parents to opt-out their kids from any lessons involving the books, but it later changed course, denying any opt-outs. billy moges, a mother of 3 and devout christian, says she withdrew her children from montgomery county, md., public schools over administrators refusal to let them opt-out from the reading of storybooks involving lgbtq themes. abc news when i was in school, i was opted-out of sex ed because i wasnt ready, and my parents didnt feel it was appropriate for the teachers to talk about it, and it didnt hurt anyone, said billy moges, a mother of three and devout christian, who pulled her kids from montgomery county schools because of the books. the problem with some of these books, though, as well, is they were love stories, so it was not just exposure to lgbtq characters. these were love stories, said elkoshairi. school officials explained in court documents that administering an opt-out program became too cumbersome to manage, led to higher rates of student absenteeism, and was ultimately inconsistent with an educational mission of supporting all types of families. emily and sharon mcgowan of montgomery county, md., have a second and sixth-grader enrolled in public schools. abc news these books are representing the community that is surrounding these children, said emily mcgowan, who mothers second- and sixth-graders with her wife sharon in montgomery county. you cannot deny that we exist. we live here, our kids go to school here. the mcgowans say opt-outs over lgbtq stories harm the children whose family lives are represented in the books. the idea that 10 of their classmates get to get up and walk out because theres two mommies in this book - what is the message thats sent to our kid who has two mommies? said sharon mcgowan. that something is so offensive about this that they get to walk out and maybe they even get to go to the playground and have extra play time? nearly every state gives parents the ability to opt-out their children from sex education classes but opt-outs for lgbtq issues vary widely by community and are often decided by board members elected by local parents, walsh said. the supreme court is seen in washington, jan. 10, 2025. abc news we can all understand parents having strong feelings about when and how is my child going to be taught about sexual issues. so, there are more opt-outs about this than anything else. but if the supreme court rules in favor of the plaintiffs in this case, its not gonna stop with just sex and gender issues. it will cover a wide variety of things that parents may have objections to, he said. the case comes as the trump administration has vowed to give more control over education to local leaders and communities. but even in places where school boards are choosing to prioritize diversity, equity and inclusion in their curriculum - like montgomery county - some conservatives are still pushing to override policies. sarah brannen is the author of uncle bobbys wedding, an illustrated childrens book featuring a gay couple and their niece. abc news the school board has decided to disrupt the thinking of their children on an area that has long been understood as going to the core of parental authority for their children, on sex and gender, said will haun, a senior attorney at becket fund for religious liberty, which is representing the plaintiffs before the supreme court. in that area, the first amendment absolutely protects the parents. the democratic process is important, and thats where we debate curriculum, haun added, but here were talking about restoring an opt-out right, which is not a challenge to the curriculum. wael elkoshairi insists he harbors no ill will toward lgbtq families and says he isnt calling for a ban on any books. but he hopes the high court - as a matter of faith - will give parents greater control. wael elkosairi is among hundreds of montgomery county, md., parents of public school children hoping the u.s. supreme court will establish a constitutional right to opt-out of lessons that conflict with religious beliefs. abc news when people have differences of opinion on certain things, accommodations work well to relieve everybody, and we move on, elkosairi said. as for the mcgowans, they are hoping the courts conservative majority holds the line. the fact that the court took the case at all - i dont have reason to believe that they took the case to affirm the importance of inclusion in the public schools, said sharon mcgowan. if harm is done by their decision, we will figure out what we need to do at a personal and a community level to mitigate that harm. people walk past the u.s. supreme court, in washington, april 21, 2025. abc news a decision in the case is expected by the end of june.

  Title: Trump finally goes all in on tariffs. Free traders on the right and left are furious
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-03 23:05:03)
  Content: analysis the immediate anger and fallout from trumps tariff plan illustrates how a poor u.s. economy could politically isolate the president, writes john bowden from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. free trade advocates in the republican partys old guard piled on donald trump as the stock market tumbled sharply downwards on thursday in response to the white houses tariff plan. wednesdays announcement of across-the-board tariffs on nearly all countries that export goods to the us sent markets spiraling in after-hours trading, which solidified into a steep drop thursday morning. reuters reported that the first us job losses from import tariff hikes were taking place in michigan and indiana, where automaker stellantis announced hundreds of temporary layoffs due to idling production facilities in mexico and canada. signs of the backlash from within conservative circles were already evident wednesday afternoon, as a handful of gop senators including former majority leader mitch mcconnell sided with democrats to condemn the presidents trade action. make no mistake goods made in america will be more expensive to manufacture and, ultimately, for consumers to purchase, with higher broad-based tariffs, mcconnell said after his vote. center-right media hammered trump on thursday while us allies showed no signs of backing down and instead openly plotted their own tariff measures in response. a trade war appears imminent on the road ahead. assuming the policy sticksand we hope it doesntthe effort amounts to an attempt to remake the u.s. economy and the world trading system, the murdoch-owned wall street journal editorial board wrote thursday morning. if the response is widespread retaliation, the result could be shrinking world trade and slower growth, recession, or worse, the journal continued. there will certainly be higher costs for american consumers and businesses. on the bulwark, host jonathan last sarcastically quipped thursday the woke socialist markets do not seem to appreciate the brilliance of trumps beautiful, very strong tariffs. the white house fired out its own news release highlighting praise from a handful of industry trade groups, as well as republican members of congress. but over wednesday evening and thursday morning the media and economic experts spent the hours picking apart apparent inconsistencies and other confusing aspects of the liberation day announcement. a top target of ridicule for the white houses usual critics were the 10 percent duties levied on the heard and mcdonald islands, a remote pair of islands controlled by australia with no human population and extremely limited fishing activity, according to forbes. virtually zero exports from the penguin-infested rocks reach the us. impressed the crack white house economic team not only found the heard and mcdonald islandsan uninhabited australian territory which is a two week sail from the mainland requiring a permit to visitbut that they managed to figure out the optimal retaliatory tariff to impose on penguins, wrote justin wolfers, a senior fellow at the brookings institution. on consumer news channel cnbc, one reporter could not hide his disdain for the formula used to calculate the reciprocal tariffs put into place by the white house, which according to a number of economists did not appear to actually factor in tariffs put into place by us trade partners. i started calling international trade economic experts, steve liesman said on the network thursday morning. nobody ever heard of this formula. nobody has ever used this formula. so im sorry, but the conclusion seems to be that the president kind of made this up as he went along. he made it up. ian bremmer of the eurasia group, added this is incredibly stupid. yales nonpartisan budget lab was out with increasingly dire predictions for the us economy after the presidents announcement this week. clothing and apparel prices are set to spike by nearly 20 percent nationwide, according to an analysis published wednesday, while the overall economy will shrink and american households in the middle income bracket will be hit with an annual income loss of around 1,700. i expect the fallout to continue into next week, as everyone is trying to assess what the effect will be on final consumer prices, michael tamvakis, a professor and economist with city st. georges university of london, told the independent on thursday. i imagine any good not available in the domestic us market will be affected, especially any food commodities which have to be imported promptly and have a short shelf life, tamvakis predicted. electronics, pharmaceuticals and auto sales would be among the sectors affected immediately, he explained, with higher drug prices in particular having the potential to hurt poorer americans the most. with the trump administration under a self-acknowledged mandate to bring down consumer prices and inflation, the president could be setting republicans up in a very uncomfortable spot come midterm season. the state of the us economy is likely to be very close to the top of voters minds as congressional reelection campaigns begin in earnest next year and later in 2024, for some. high grocery prices and other issues caused by a trade war could easily lead voters to hand the house back to democratic control for the remainder of trumps term, even if the senate remains out of reach. the real danger trump faces could be from dividing the coalition which has now elected him twice traditional republican voters who want to see the us economy grow and thrive, and maga true believers who are willing to see a contraction if it means reorganizing the economy under an america first vision. democrats, of course, are counting on this as their party continues to grapple with a crisis of confidence. voters remain unhappy with congressional democrats, especially senate minority leader chuck schumer, amid the doge-ification of the federal government and the collapse of democratic resistance in the senate, both in the face of the laken riley act and more recent government shutdown fight. schumer, who saw his party shed three seats in the senate last year, maintains that he still has a winning record in terms of both elections and legislating. a tanking us economy could make that pronouncement a reality come next year. if trump doesnt see things turn around for the us economy before the end of the year, he could well end up handing schumer a lifeline right when his rival needs it most. join thought-provoking

  Title: How might Trump tariffs affect UK business on ‘Liberation Day’?
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-01 23:32:28)
  Content: analysis sweeping changes set to affect the uk and ultimately large parts of the world from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep

americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. liberation day as the white house grandly calls the unveiling of its new trade policy is finally upon us. but what it actually means and what the impact will be is still not clear, as president donald trump keeps businesses and world leaders waiting until wednesday to unveil the next round of tariffs. while mr trump has suggested all nations will be hit with additional levies and sir keir starmer has admitted the uk is unlikely to escape the new measures its still far from certain exactly which industries will bear the brunt this time, with steel, aluminium and auto parts already subject to additional import costs. heres a look at whats already known, what could happen, and what investors are doing as uncertainty reigns. the top end of the uk stock market has performed relatively well this year, considering concerns over growth, inflation, still-high interest rates and the wider geopolitical landscape. the ftse 100 is up more than 5 per cent year-to-date, in contrast to the us sp 500 being down around the same amount. the uncertainty has hit smaller businesses more, with the ftse 250 down 5.2 per cent in 2025 and the aim all-share index down 4.3 per cent. more recently, while there was a sell-off on monday ahead of these new tariffs, it eventually wasnt as steep as had initially looked the case and tuesday saw investors buying once more on price weaknesses, perhaps hinting that some saw limited further downside in share price terms, even with new tariffs to come. it has always been a fools game at guessing the stock markets most immediate, very next move, but aj bell analysis notes that while the biggest tech stocks in america the so-called magnificent seven have lost a combined 2.3 trillion in the first quarter of this year, they have strong growth prospects well into the future and that status makes them natural candidates to attract widespread buying when markets are more upbeat. in the uk, defence stocks in particular have fared strongly so far, with a domestic political strategy based on increased spending in this area pushing share prices higher while the price of gold, a traditional safe haven for investors, has repeatedly hit new record highs this year and is predicted by some analysts to rise even further across 2025. price hikes and job losses could have a total global economic toll of 1.4 trillion 1.1 trillion under the worst-case scenario according to aston business school. that is if full global retaliation with reciprocal tariffs is the eventual outcome, which would see the us economy in particular hit. naturally, if the entire planet is affected to that scale, the uk wouldnt be exempt, but theres still scope for changing trade paths, perhaps seeking out partners to increase back-and-forth business with if a reliance on the us is no longer plausible. quite aside from the businesses involved, government spending could also be impacted. last week, rachel reeves noted the government was laying out savings to restore 9.9bn of headroom for government expenditure. one assessment of a worst-case scenario involving trump tariffs and the uk suggests that would be entirely and immediately wiped out. david miles, from the office for budget responsibilitys obr budget responsibility committee, told mps if tariffs at 20 25 per cent were put on the uk and maintained for five years, our assessment of what that does is that it will knock out all the headroom that the government currently has. had we made that a central forecast, and had the government not changed policy at all knowing that we were going to take that as our central forecast, then the headroom would have pretty much all gone. mr miles noted the improbability of the extreme scenario, which would include a term beyond the next us presidential elections, but the obr further noted the hit to business confidence across the uk caused by the uncertainty around tariffs and other costs. at the other end of the scale, theres the perspective that some changes could in fact mean the uk might actually benefit from a trade war. again, its important to note thats on a broad, all-encompassing term there would still be businesses or industries negatively affected within that. but the obr noted that if the uk avoided involvement in a trade war, reciprocal tariffs and the like, some redirected trade flows could end up increasing business this side of the water. much of that is based around the fact that the uk-us trade deficit is far more reasonably balanced than, for example, the eu-us one. professor irina surdu-nardella, of warwick business school, told cnbc tariffs could yet have a limited impact on the uk. effects would be relatively limited to industries such as fishing and mining, ms surdu-nardella said, pointing to the service-focused nature of the uk economy meaning much of it would be unscathed by import tariffs. of course, theres also the possibility that mr trump and mr starmer find an agreement whereby british companies end up entirely unaffected by the whole process, potentially giving them a foothold to gain further business with overseas customers. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see

  Title: Why US Treasuries Sell-Off Is Nightmare Scenario for the Economy - Newsweek

observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. newsweek ai is in beta. translations may contain inaccuraciesplease refer to the original content. voice is ai-generated. inconsistencies may occur. a swift and sharp sell-off in u.s. treasuries is rattling global financial markets, shaking the foundation of what has long been considered one of the worlds premier safe-haven assets. the u.s. treasury market, valued at nearly 29 trillion, underpins everything from global reserves to corporate borrowing costs. its stability is central to the functioning of the global financial system. a severe disruption in this market, like the current sell-off, could severely tighten financial conditions worldwide. if confidence in treasuries continues to erode, the u.s. may find itself paying more to finance its debt, exacerbating fiscal pressures at a time of persistent deficits and geopolitical tension. concern over the potential impacts of president donald trumps reciprocal tariffs, as well as retaliation from foreign trading partners, has rocked markets in recent days, with wider fears that their inflationary effects could push the u.s. economy closer toward a recession. u.s. treasuries are debt securities issued by the u.s. department of the treasury to finance the federal governments spending when its revenues are insufficient to cover its expenses. yieldsthe interest rate on treasuriesspiked on wednesday as trumps reciprocal tariffs took effect, signaling that investors are offloading their government bonds in large numbers. the yield on 10-year treasuries jumped to more than 4.5 percent shortly after midnight, with 30-year yields surpassing 5 percent and two-year yields briefly reaching above 3.8 percent. u.s. government bonds were the safe-haven investment for the worlds investors because they were seen as the rock in a turbulent world, said paul de grauwe, a professor in european political economy at the london school of economics. now the u.s. government is the preeminent source of turbulence and unpredictability. no wonder investors are looking for another rock. the new reciprocal dutiesaimed at eliminating trade deficits and reshoring american manufacturingwent into effect for dozens of countries on wednesday. a 104-percent tariff on chinese imports also began overnight, after beijing missed the deadline to withdraw its 34-percent retaliatory tariff on u.s. goods. bloomberg reports that foreign reserve managers, including china, may be reconsidering their u.s. government debt holdings due to trumps trade policies. reuters noted that much of the selling was done by hedge funds to raise cash for margin calls, as the value of their portfolios continues to decline amid the ongoing market rout. reuters compared the sell-off to the 2020 dash-for-cash panic that prompted 1.6 trillion in emergency federal reserve purchases. similarly, british economist and former chief adviser to the bank of england charles goodhart told newsweek that the sudden sell-off could be tied to the continued drop in global stock prices. the technical problem is that the sharp decline in equity prices has required those who have levered up their position in equities to raise cash to meet margin calls, and that might have led them to sell treasury bonds as the best way in these circumstances to meet cash requirements, goodhart said. during the month of january, 10-year interest rateswhich is probably the most important rate in the country, since mortgages and capital formation are based on ithad almost spiked to 5 percent, treasury secretary scott bessent said in a recent interview with tucker carlson. and i think 5 percent can be an uncomfortable area for the economy, for the treasury, for issuing bonds. in an interview with fox business in early february, bessent said that the administration would be paying close attention to the 10-year treasury yields to assess when the federal reserve might cut interest rates. the administration has been pushing the federal reserve to cut rates, but the potential inflationary impacts of trumps tariffs could limit the central banks ability to do so, reuters reported. with growing fears of stagflationslow economic growth coupled with rising inflationthis creates a difficult situation for fed chairman jerome powell. to address slower growth, fed officials can reduce the benchmark interest rate to make borrowing cheaper and boost investment. however, the central bank normally raises rates in order to combat inflationary pressures. meanwhile, the u.s. dollar index fell under 102 points for the first time since the presidential election. calvin yeoh, portfolio manager at hedge fund blue edge advisors pte, told bloomberg this is a fire-sale of treasuries. i havent seen moves or volatility of this size since the chaos of the pandemic in 2020. british economist and former chief adviser to the bank of england charles goodhart told newsweek the longer-term structural problem is that the tariffs will raise u.s. inflation significantly, at a time when the administration wants to cut taxation sharply, is overestimating revenue from tariffs, and is trying to put pressure on the fed to cut interest rates. in addition, what foreigners are likely to want to buy treasury bonds now? so, the underlying structural condition looks to be one of increasing potential unsustainability of the u.s. fiscal position with a significant danger of accelerating inflation. under these circumstances, u.s. t bonds will look increasingly risky over the medium to longer term, even if in the short run the federal open market committee cuts short-term interest rates quite sharply, he added. a very sharply rising yield curve would then develop. paul de grauwe, professor of political economy at the london school of economics, told newsweek if there is no quick reversal of economic policies, the u.s. treasuries will indeed lose their safe-haven status. it will not come back soon, as the u.s. government is seen as unreliable much in the same way as governments of banana republics are. the trump tariffs are one of the most spectacular self-harm decisions a government has made in history, he added. it will lead to further negative effects for the u.s. economy. the sell-out of treasuries is just one in a series of further self-inflicted economic negative events. a recession is now inevitable. trumps reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries took effect on wednesday. the administration has indicated that there will be no pause on the duties, though trump has suggested that he may be open to cutting fair deals, with certain countries. newsweek is committed to journalism thats factual and fair. hold us accountable

  Title: Trump ‘Liberation Day’ live: President set to unveil secret tariff plan as world braces for its economic impact
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-02 14:47:57)
  Content: all eyes are on president trump as he prepares to reveal the next phase of his sweeping tariff agenda, leaving global markets fearing a trade war from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. donald trump is preparing to unveil a raft of new tariffs on wednesday afternoon in what the president has repeatedly billed as liberation day. trump has promised to roll out reciprocal dollar-for-dollar tariffs on nations that levy duties on u.s. goods as part of an aggressive attempt to fulfill his administrations america first agenda and correct years of what he deems unfair trade. international markets wait tentatively as the president is expected to unveil his plans at 4 p.m. wednesday at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden at the moment american markets close. plans remain under wraps with trumps team reportedly weighing options through tuesday. however, white house press secretary karoline leavitt stated that the president had already decided his course of action and that the tariffs would go into effect almost immediately. the only way to avoid the new levies, she said, is to move production to the u.s. it follows the liberal candidate for a critical seat on the wisconsin supreme court, susan crawford, who defeated conservative brad schimel in a race seen as a referendum on trump and his billionaire adviser elon musk. former republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is on board with an effort by democrats in the upper chamber led by senators tim kaine, amy klobuchar, and mark warner to end donald trumps made-up emergency that the president has declared against canada allowing him authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on the u.s.s northern neighbor. trump claims the authority by declaring a national emergency caused by the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migration from canada as well as mexico and china. president trump is saying that there is an emergency with canada. canada is a friend, not an adversary. canada is a sovereign nation, not a 51st state, senator kaine of virginia said on tuesday. this morning, cnns haley talbot reports that the list of republicans who will vote yes on a tariffs resolution up for a vote today at around 7 p.m. has grown to include the former gop leader of the senate. kaine said he approached mcconnell last night and didnt even get to the question before the kentucky senator said im with you. other republicans in support of the move to at least symbolically rebuke the president on his trade policy just a few hours after his liberation day announcement on reciprocal tariffs expected to cover a large swathe of u.s. trading partners include senators susan collins, lisa murkowski, and rand paul. senator thom tillis also told cnn that he doesnt plan on voting for kaines resolution, but has some concerns with the trade policies being discussed, adding, we need to see what comes out tomorrow wednesday and be instructed by that before we take action. earlier, trump wrote in part on truth social mitch mcconnell of kentucky, susan collins of maine, lisa murkowski of alaska, and rand paul, also of kentucky, will hopefully get on the republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize canada for the sale, into our country, of large amounts of fentanyl, by tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy. they are playing with the lives of the american people, and right into the hands of the radical left democrats and drug cartels. the senate bill is just a ploy of the dems to show and expose the weakness of certain republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the house will never approve it and i, as your president, will never sign it. after breaking the record for the longest senate speech in history, cory booker now seems to have broken the internet, with a slew of praise, memes and even tiktok videos commemorating his mammoth achievement. the new jersey democrat took to the senate floor on monday evening, saying he would remain there as long as he was physically able. the speech lasted a whopping 25 hours and 5 minutes. mike bedigan looks at some of the online reactions. it was fitting that cory booker was recounting a story about the late civil rights leader john lewis as he entered the 19th minute and 24th hour of a historic speech to the senate on tuesday evening. in that moment, the first black senator for new jersey broke a record for the longest speech ever made in congress, one that was set 67 years ago by the segregationist democrat strom thurmond, who spoke for a day and a night in opposition to the civil rights act. overcome with emotion, booker looked up to the ceiling and touched his heart as his fellow democrats in the chamber applauded his effort. one of msnbcs morning joe hosts is delighting in the fact that the wisconsin supreme court candidate backed by elon musks lost - even after the tech mogul dumped millions into the race. wisconsin voters elected liberal justice susan crawford to the states supreme court on tuesday, beating brad schimel by more than 200,000 votes in the most expensive judicial election in u.s. history. the vote keeps the high courts 4-3 liberal majority intact. musk repeatedly played up the stakes of the election, claiming it will direct the destiny of humanity and the future of the world is at stake. now, morning joe host joe scarborough is reveling in the massive loss musk suffered. katie hawkinson reports from washington, d.c. the u.s. has sent a three-person team to myanmar to help respond to the 7.7-magnitude earthquake, in a move criticized as weak and irrelevant by a former aid official. much larger russian and chinese teams have already been helping search-and-rescue efforts in the country for days. steffie banatvala reports. a mother and her three children were wrongfully detained by immigration enforcement agents in new york and taken to a detention facility in texas, a nonprofit says as it calls for their release. immigration and customs enforcement officers detained the mother - whose birth country was not disclosed - and her kids, one of whom is in third grade, on march 27 while they were executing an arrest on a farm in sackets harbor, new york, according to the new york immigration coalition. kelly rissman reports. elon musk broke his silence after suffering defeat in the wisconsin supreme court race, which cemented a liberal majority for the next three years. susan crawfords win keeps the court under a 4-3 liberal majority in the face of crucial litigation surrounding abortion access, voting rights and redistricting. like president donald trump, musk chose to focus on the background win of wisconsin voters approving the constitutional amendment to enshrine voter id laws, a vote that was being held at the same time as the supreme court race. this was the most important thing, musk posted on x in response to a post on voter id. madeline sherratt has the full story. kelly loeffler, former georgia senator and now head of the small business administration in the trump administration, hailed donald trumps liberation day as the single greatest salvation, for not just small businesses, but for america, during an appearance on fox business this morning. the president eagerly posted a clip of her conversation with maria bartiromo to his truth social account italys prime minister giorgia meloni and the countrys top business lobby warned on wednesday that impending u.s. tariffs could significantly impact the nations exports and its already struggling economy. it is clear that the introduction of new tariffs would have heavy repercussions for italian producers, meloni said while hosting a prize-giving ceremony for italian cuisine in rome. meloni added that she did not rule out adequate responses to protect the exports of the euro zones third largest economy, though she did not provide further details. italy recorded a trade surplus with the united states of 39 billion euros 42.14 billion in 2024, the third largest in the 20-nation euro area, according to eurostat data. earlier on wednesday, the business association confindustria reported that italys economy is expected to grow by 0.6 this year, half of the governments official target and down from a 0.9 forecast made by the group in october. the economy expanded by a modest 0.7 in both 2024 and 2023. it managed to achieve 0.1 growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the previous three months, after stagnating in the third quarter. most analysts do not foresee any significant rebound in the near term. confindustria indicated that while its forecasts accounted for the already-announced u.s. tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as what it termed record levels of uncertainty regarding trade policy, they did not consider the effects of an escalating trade war. in a worst-case scenario, with permanent 25 u.s. tariffs on all imports, rising to 60 for china, coupled with retaliatory measures against u.s. exports, italys growth could decline to around 0.2 this year, it said. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

street opened on thursday morning after donald trump unveiled his latest wave of tariffs on what the president called liberation day. trumps announcement sent shockwaves through markets around the globe, and shortly after the bell rang at the new york stock exchange, the dow jones industrial average fell 1,150 points or 2.7. the sp 500 dropped more than 3, and the tech-focused nasdaq more than 4.2. the president announced that blanket 10 percent tariffs will be imposed on all nations in a speech at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden shortly after regular trading hours closed in the u.s. about 60 countries deemed the worst offenders including china where a majority of apples devices are manufactured face higher reciprocal levies nearing, in some cases, 50 percent leaving world leaders reeling. the baseline tariffs go into effect on saturday and reciprocal tariffs on wednesday. meanwhile, four republican senators joined every democratic senator in a resolution to oppose trumps tariffs against canada. the senate passed the resolution crafted by kentucky senator rand paul 51-48 on wednesday after trumps announcement. a senate hearing devolved into chaos after sen. ted cruz repeatedly spoke over sen. amy klobuchar as the pair exchanged barbs over nationwide injunctions inhibiting president donald trumps agenda. during wednesdays hearing, the texas lawmaker excoriated federal judges and declared that nationwide injunctions are an abuse of power. cruzs comments come as republicans are attempting to pass a bill to limit judicial rulings against the trump administration. james liddell reports. andrew feinberg and katie hawkinson report from washington, d.c. far-right activist laura loomer met with president donald trump and pressed him to fire several members of the national security council and reports indicate he has taken her advice. trump fired several members of the national security council, including senior directors, after the meeting, axios reports. one u.s. official told the outlet the firings are shaping up to be a bloodbath. the new yorktimes added that at least three senior nsc officials have been fired. this comes after times first reported loomer met with trump, vice president jd vance, national security adviser mike waltz and others in the oval office on wednesday, armed with extensive research she believed worked against several staffers. donald trumps press secretary has claimed that he is partly responsible for a spiritual revival in america and is helping people move closer to god. karoline leavitt, a practicing roman catholic, said that evidence of renewed faith, especially within younger generations, was becoming more visible and that it was a beautiful sight. mike bedigan has the story. an economic analyst says the 50 percent reciprocal trade tariff on lesotho will kill the tiny southern african kingdom that the u.s. president ridiculed last month. spains prime minister has led european leaders in condemning donald trumps sweeping tariffs. pedro sanchez, whose country sells large amounts of car parts, steel and chemicals to the us, described the move to bring in reciprocal tariffs on imported goods from the eu as unintelligent and a return to 19th-century protectionism. steffie banatvala reports. its midday in new york, two and half hours since markets opened on wall street, and initial losses on the major indices appear to have leveled out for now and even recovered slightly from their trading low points. they all remain significantly down from the opening. the dow jones industrial average is now down 1,296 points 3.11 the sp 500 is down 215 points 3.79 and the tech-focused nasdaq has lost 863 points 4.90. canada will impose a 25 tariff on all vehicles imported from the united states that are not compliant with the u.s.-mexico-canada trade deal, prime minister mark carney told a press conference on thursday. carney also said the new tariffs would not apply to auto parts and would not affect vehicle content from mexico. two senior lawmakers on the senate finance committee introduced legislation on thursday aimed at limiting u.s. president donald trumps ability to impose tariffs and requiring congressional approval for new levies within 60 days. republican senator chuck grassley and democrat maria cantwell presented a bill that mandates the president to notify congress about new tariffs, providing an explanation of the rationale along with an analysis of the potential impact on u.s. businesses and consumers. congress must pass a joint resolution of approval for the new tariff within 60 days otherwise, all new tariffs on imports would expire. this bill reasserts congress role over trade policy to ensure rules-based trade policies are transparent, consistent, and benefit the american public, cantwell said. as representatives of the american people, congress has a duty to stop actions that will cause them harm. the bill is based on the war powers resolution of 1973 and aims to reestablish limits on the presidents authority to impose unilateral tariffs without congressional approval. for too long, congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch, grassley said. grassleys home state of iowa relies significantly on farm crop exports, whereas cantwells washington state hosts many export-driven companies like boeing. the senate passed legislation on wednesday that would terminate new tariffs on canada. with reporting from reuters the newsmax team and former trump lawyer and ally rudy giuliani got to ring the opening bell at the new york stock exchange this morning. bit of a shame for them that it was on a day when the presidents

yeah, well, listen, that thats very good spinach what they serve. but you know, paul, to your point, you know, typically geopolitics sits well in the back seat of the car, if you will, and every once in a while, the driver, which is either interest rates or or corporate profits, who tends to sit shotgun, looks back and says, hey, pipe down. thats just not the case right now. we have this unfortunate series of events where we we obviously have the immediacy of tariffs, but we dont have the clarity on when well actually see tax reform, nor, as i mentioned earlier, when will we actually see more of an active dialogue across global officials. and so the initial salvo with respect to responses from macron, with responses to what we heard from china was, were not necessarily going to come immediately to the negotiation table. so what i think that means is theres probably some more spinach, if you will, being handed out by the by the passenger in the back seat to mix metaphors. but more importantly, what i think this challenges investors like us to think about is just, okay, where does that fundamental case ultimately kick in? what will consumers do? and wed already seen before the tariff announcements some bifurcation between higher income, middle income, and lower income consumers. and if anything, the risk is that gap widens and it widens more quickly. so some of the market reaction we think is that that time gap between moving from the the spinach course to the dessert course, but it also, i think, begs the question of when will we see a deterioration in consumer activity. were not going to learn a lot from the jobs data tomorrow. we will learn from what chair powell has to say with more of his forward views. but ill also just say this, this is actually not very well covered, but we had vice chair jefferson present today in atlanta. and again, very intelligent economist. he mentioned in the course of a 3,000 word presentation, this is the parsing that we do, he used the word tariff once in that entire presentation. so what i think that says is there may be a little bit of a of a hold off of a firm communication from the fed if were to use vice chair jeffersons guidance today. therell be a lot of focus on what we hear from chair powell tomorrow. reuters -institutional shareholder services has recommended pfizer investors reject a proposal on executive compensation at its upcoming annual meeting, citing concerns about certain changes made to long-term awards to its ceo and others. the modifications, including repeated changes to pfizers cash flow targets, and a lack of clarity about certain pipeline goals are concerning and undermine a pay-for-performance philosophy, iss said. annual incentives for executives are tied to achieving three financial goals, and payouts can be 30 percentage points higher or lower based on pipeline and esg-related goals achieved, iss said. cybersecurity stocks have not been immune from the recent market sell-off, opening up some attractive entry points for some of the top companies in the space. lets look at three cybersecurity stocks you might want to buy now and hold for the long term. while known for its next-generation firewalls, palo alto networks nasdaq panw has transformed itself into more of a complete cybersecurity company. buying high-quality dividend stocks is a great way to collect passive dividend income. the best ones increase their dividends each year, and they can help you more than offset the impact of inflation over the long run. federal realty investment trust nyse frt, nnn reit nyse nnn, and essex property trust nyse ess have elite records of growing their dividends. microsoft, alphabet, nvidia and amazon are part of the zacks top analyst blog. here are buffetts words on investing through a crisis. can you retire at 65 with 750,000 in a roth ira and 1,800 in monthly social security?

  Title: World braces for 'Liberation Day' as Trump set to reveal sweeping tariffs
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-02 10:00:13)
  Content: markets and foreign capitals have braced themselves for a broad set of tariffs from president trump on wednesday, anxious for details on a dramatic shift in u.s. trade policy that is expected to supercharge the costs of cars, houses and everyday goods for americans. it is unclear whether the trump administration plans to impose a universal, baseline rate for import taxes on trading partners, or to customize tariff policy to each foreign nation, imposing reciprocal rates on a case-by-case basis. it is also unclear whether there will be any exceptions. a white house official told the times that exact details of the plan are still being perfected. the lack of clarity has rattled markets in recent weeks, driving the worst first annual quarter in three years and erasing gains on the standard poors 500 index made since trumps election victory in november. the white house said trump would announce his plans at 1 p.m. pacific time on wednesday, precisely when closing bells ring on wall street. after that, the new policy will be effective immediately, white house press secretary karoline leavitt told reporters at a tuesday news briefing. costs could rise immediately on perishable goods caught in limbo at international ports, including avocados and pineapples, said sung won sohn, a former commissioner at the port of los angeles. prices on larger items with dwindling inventories, such as foreign cars and washing machines, are likely to rise within weeks. lumber is stacked outside at the milan lumber co. in milan, n.h. robert f. bukaty associated press for los angeles, in particular, the tariffs are coming at a very bad time, sohn said. were in kind of bad shape, because you need a lot of lumber to rebuild from the fires, and the construction hasnt started yet. itll probably start in three to four months, and thats exactly when were going to be hit by higher prices for lumber. top european union leaders have alluded to potent retaliation that could extend beyond american whiskey and hit directly at silicon valley, core to the u.s. and californian economy. and californias agricultural economy the nations largest could become a target as well. retaliatory tariffs are expected to come from nations across the world affected by the new rates, risking further response from the trump administration, thus prompting a spiral into a trade war with few winners. leaders in canada, the second largest u.s. trading partner, have said ottawa will react swiftly to any new tariff actions. but mexican president claudia sheinbaum suggested tuesday that her administration will not retaliate immediately if washington slaps new taxes on mexican imports. we dont believe in an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, because that always leads to a bad situation, sheinbaum told journalists at her daily news conference. mexican president claudia sheinbaum addresses supporters at a march 9, 2025, rally at the zocalo, mexico citys main square. eduardo verdugo associated press instead, she called for further negotiations with the u.s., even while acknowledging that she has no plans to speak to trump in the coming days. the dialogue must continue, sheinbaum said. its not a matter of you put that, so ill put that, but rather whats best for mexico. shorter-term pain trumps advisors say the new policy will bring about an overdue correction, returning fair trade practices, ultimately raising significant revenue for the federal government and bringing back manufacturing to u.s. shores. it is, in many ways, the culmination of a years-long campaign by trump to increase tariffs going back to the 1980s, when as a real estate developer and celebrity, he accused japan and china of laughing at and ripping off the united states. in his address to a joint session of congress on march 4, trump complained that countries across the globe place tariffs on u.s.-made goods. on average, the european union, china, brazil, india, mexico, and canada have you heard of them? and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. its very unfair, he said. in his first term, trump negotiated a detailed trade deal, the united states-mexico-canada agreement, that replaced the north american free trade agreement and governed trade practices among the united states and its closest trading partners. susano cordoba sells peanuts to truck drivers lining up in tijuana to cross the border into the united states on march 4, 2025. gregory bull associated press but since resuming office in january, trump has repeatedly threatened new rounds of tariffs on mexican and canadian goods, often retreating from his plans at the last moment. the on-again, off-again threat of tariffs have contributed to the instability jolting stock markets, which closed on tuesday slightly up after a day of volatile trading. allies of the white house have acknowledged that short-term pain can be expected for u.s. households in the wake of the new policy implementation, which trump has referred to as liberation day. theres absolutely going to be short-term pain, republican sen. tim sheehy of montana told cnn on monday. the presidents been clear about that. everyone has. if youre going to remodel your house to make it better in the end, its going to be really annoying in the short term, when your house is getting remodeled and theres drywall dust everywhere and theres workers in your living room, sheehy added. the reality is that remodels got to happen in order to make things stronger and more stable in the back end. already, american consumers have begun to cut back on their spending and boost their savings. a friday report from the bureau of economic analysis , a government agency, showed that the personal savings rate rose 4.6 in february. consumer spending increased just .4, after decreasing by .3 in january. leavitt added tuesday that many countries have been calling the president, asking for relief from the anticipated tariffs. she said the president is open to taking their calls. its simple if you make your product in america, you will pay no tariffs, leavitt said. it is unclear how the administration will measure the success of the new tariffs. leavitt called the stock market, which has experienced volatility in recent weeks over tariff turmoil, a snapshot in time. the white house has repeatedly pointed to companies that have newly invested in the u.s. since trump took office as evidence of tariffs working. a pause on other 25 tariffs against canada and mexico is also set to expire tuesday, and the white house would not confirm whether it would be lifted. trumps announcement comes the same day that 25 tariffs were set to take effect on auto imports at 1201 a.m. wednesday. times staff writer kate linthicum in mexico city contributed to this report.

  Title: Michael Goodwin: Trump bets the White House — and GOP control of Congress — on tariffs
  Source: nypost.com (2025-04-05 20:09:02)
  Content: maybe all that winning was becoming boring. whatever the reasons that led president trump to rock the globe with his liberation day tariff regime, the immediate result has been a world of hurt for millions upon millions of americans. the stock market meltdown that wiped out some 6.4 trillion of value last thursday and friday means many households saw 10 or more of their nest eggs suddenly erased. their pain is matched only by their confusion about why the president triggered the sell-off. after all, trump 2.0 was scoring major successes by sealing the border and deporting alien criminals. the doge audit was proving his claims of massive government waste and fraud. similarly, his crackdown on columbia and other universities that allow hamas supporters to harass and intimidate jewish students is rattling the radicals where it hurts most in their multimillion dollar federal grants. meanwhile, his election provided a big boost to the economy, which has been humming along. because he has been faithful to his campaign promises, polls show trump with the highest approval rating hes ever had. his winning streak is not the only thing in jeopardy. given the tumult on wall street and in markets around the world, its reasonable to conclude that trump is betting his presidency and gop control of congress on the tariff gambit. that probably wasnt his plan, but like it not, thats how its playing out. the early returns are not promising. by 15 percentage points, voters hold a negative view of trumps handling of inflation and most oppose his emphasis on tariffs, a wall street journal poll finds. negative views of his economic stewardship outweigh positive views by 8 points, according to the survey, which was completed before markets tanked last week. public doubts about the economy are dramatic when you recall how important the subject was to trumps victory. his attacks on bidenomics and inflation became a key reason why trump swept the seven swing states and his party carried congress. yet demoralized and divided democrats now smell blood as some voters begin to sour. the disruption caused by the tariff war is so severe that jpmorgan economists predict it could take a big bite out of americas gross domestic product this year and warn that if, the tariffs remain in place, there is a 60 chance of a global recession. federal reserve chairman jerome powell, no fan of trumps to start with, said the tariffs could lead to both higher inflation and slower growth. naturally, the fear gauges are also rising among congressional republicans. texas sen. ted cruz said friday that if the tariff war pushes the us into a recession, particularly a bad recession, 2026 in all likelihood politically would be a bloodbath. you would face a democrat house, and you might even face a democrat senate. none of this is certain, of course, nor is it meant to suggest trumps goal isnt worthy. leveling global trade is admirable and a core tenet of his america first approach. he aims to protect and expand domestic manufacturing and create good, well-paying jobs by giving more companies incentives to move their headquarters and factories to the united states. its been a consistent theme since he entered politics in 2015 with a rousing denunciation of the globalists whose unfair trade practices hollowed out large industries in middle america. and he celebrated his 2024 win by hosting business titans at mar-a-lago who promised to invest in america. among them was japans softbank, whose chief executive pledged to invest 100 billion. thats the point of tariffs to incentivize companies to make their products and create jobs in the us. meanwhile, the taxes on imported products also provide washington with a source of revenue, with the white house predicting as much as 700 billion would be collected this year under the new rates, which would help fund tax cuts. if they are reciprocal, which trump insists he wants, tariffs would even the score by punishing imported goods at the same rate as countries do that impose high taxes on american products sold abroad. a prime example of the current imbalance was noted by white house adviser stephen miller why is that if you go to tokyo, theres no american cars, if you go to berlin, theres no american cars, but on our streets, we have every foreign car there is? he added theyve blocked their markets from our cars. president trump is saying that has to end. although the president has repeatedly denied it, the suspicion that the aim is to get trading partners to negotiate was effectively confirmed by trump himself friday afternoon. just had a very productive call with to lam, general secretary of the communist party of vietnam, who told me that vietnam wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s., he posted on truth social. but the first inkling of good news came just hours after china raised its tax on american products to 34, saying reciprocal levies were necessary to stop trumps bullying. subscribe to our daily post opinion newsletter! please provide a valid email address. by clicking above you agree to the terms of use and . china, of course, has long been the poster child of trade imbalances. a study from the us international trade commission reports that the sheer volume of chinas exports to the us outpaced americas exports to china by three to one in 2024. even a sneering axios concedes the facts, writing that china has a long record of trade abuses ip theft, forced technology transfers, state subsidies and market access restrictions for foreign companies. it continues the european union doesnt cheat the way china does. but it protects its own through generous agricultural subsidies and strict regulatory standards that often double as trade barriers. the vat, europes value added tax that can go as high as 27 in some countries, is another barrier on us imports. thus, with restrictive trade practices by other nations, theres often not much difference between friend and foe. leaving aside the predictable legacy media reaction to the turmoil one suspects there was glee in the new york times newsroom over the markets plunge and trumps political predicament there are also conservative skeptics. most of their doubts center on two elements the enormous size of the tariffs and the decision to unleash them all at once. some suggested that more modest rates and an industry-by-industry approach could be more effective because it would focus on specific countries and products, such as steel and aluminum. what do you think? post a comment. another argument is that onshoring cannot happen overnight. for foreign manufacturers to make a decision to relocate means building a facility in the us, hiring workers and producing goods a process that could take many months if not years. trump doesnt have years. the midterm elections are 19 months away. share your stance. please adhere to our the new pm of canada nailed it, he called for zero tariffs between canada and the us so both can become economic powers. this is part of the plan, drive new negotiations that favor the us economy and consumer. but the media wont ever admit that because of tds. im curious to what the next great t. a week of stock market activity doesnt mean that much, really. trump is trying to fix something that has been broken for years, and any change brings anxiety to people. will it work? we will have to wait and see, and the good news about tariffs is that they can be removed or lowered just as quickl. over the past couple of days i have seen videos of obama, pelosi and schumer talking about the unfair us trade tariff balance, especially with china. not one of them did anything to correct it though as it would hurt them politically. i give trump credit for at least trying to level the field. i do. i agree yes we need to fix the tarriff balance but a little at a time so as to preserve the lives of us citizens especially the elderly

wall street, the nasdaq broke a record with its largest single-day point drop in the markets 50-year history as investors responded to president donald trumps tariff plan. both the nasdaq and dow jones suffered their worst days since march 2020 amid the covid-19 pandemic. the dow fell 1,679 points, which ranks in the top five for most points lost in a single day. the nasdaq fell 1,050 points for its largest one-day drop. the drop happened as investors got spooked over the potential impact from president donald trumps tariff plan and fears it could spark a global trade war. trump has said the policy is necessary to level the playing field for american manufacturers. however, many economists have warned his plan could have a negative impact on the economy as tariffs are expected to raise prices. despite thursdays historically bad day, some analysts believed it could have been worse. markets may actually be underreacting, especially if these rates turn out to be final, given the potential knock-on effects to global consumption and trade, sean sun, portfolio manager at thornburg investment management, told the associated press. but trump remained confident. the markets are going to boom, the president predicted outside the white house thursday. the country is going to boom. against the backdrop of sliding markets thursday, white house officials defended the new tariffs. today, the world starts taking us seriously. our workforce will finally be treated fairly, commerce secretary howard lutnick said in a statement. hours earlier he told cnn the world should stop exploiting the united states. treasury secretary scott bessent issued a statement the presidents historic actions will level the playing field for american workers and usher in a new age of economic strength. but former treasury secretary under bill clinton, larry h. summers, said he would have left his post if such a plan was unveiled. if any administration of which i was a part had launched an economic policy so totally ungrounded in serious analysis or so dangerous and damaging, i would have resigned in protest, he wrote thursday on x. while announcing his sweeping plan, trump vowed to usher in a golden age for america. but thursdays stock market lacked any of that luster. major companies including restaurant chains, retailers, and tech giants that rely on products from around the globe saw their stocks decline as they brace for supply chain disruptions. starbucks ended the day down 11 percent while chipotle fell nearly 4 percent. shares gap tanked 20 percent and macys dropped almost 14 percent. apple plunged more than 9 percent while amazon dipped nearly the same amount. some automakers also endured a rough day as trumps 25 percent tariff on imported cars took effect. tesla stock dropped almost 6 percent and stellantis, parent company of jeep, chrysler, and dodge, slid nearly 10 percent. stellantis announced thursday it was halting production at its factories in mexico and canada. about 900 u.s. employees are expected to be laid off, the automaker said thursday. meanwhile, investors seemed to have found some solace in comfort foods. french fry producer lamb weston gained 10 percent while general mills, coca-cola and kraft heinz each gained nearly 3 percent. thursdays market plunge didnt seem to ease fears that trumps liberation day could dwindle retirement funds tied to the stock markets. georgia taylor, founder of tailored wealth, told the financial times those near retirement must monitor their pensions closely. withdrawing during market downturns can deplete funds faster, so seeking advice on a flexible withdrawal strategy is crucial. this highlights the growing need for financial planning to make pensions last longer. the effect on the retirement savings will depend on the years a person has left until retirement, maggie switek, senior director on the research team at the milken institute, told the independent. for young adults, with a longer time horizon left until retirement, the effects may be offset by future changes in the market, with the stock markets trending upward over longer periods of time. hedge fund manager bradley wickens predicted thursday was just the beginning of a long road ahead for the fallout of trumps tariff plan. he told the wall street journal the true nature of how negative this is is going to take time to manifest itself during april and may, as it all dawns on everyone that, wow, these tariffs are here for a long time. the final impact of trumps plan is still to be determined as companies and other countries determine their response. european commission president ursula von der leyen called trumps decision a major blow to the global economy, adding we are now preparing for further countermeasures, to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail. canadian prime minister mark carney announced that his country plans to match the u.s.s 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles we take these measures reluctantly. and we take them in ways that is intended and will cause maximum impact in the united states and minimum impact in canada. in the face of tariff

  Title: Trump's agenda grapples with political and economic reality - BBC

  Content: donald trump, in announcing his sweeping new tariffs on us imports on wednesday, promised that the history books would record 2 april as americas liberation day. after two days of stock market turmoil, however, this may also be remembered as the week the presidents second-term agenda ran headfirst into economic - and political - reality. us stocks have been in a tailspin since trump unveiled his tariffs at wednesday afternoons white house rose garden event, with signs that americas trading partners - canada, the european union and china, most notably - are not backing away from a fight. meanwhile, other presidential efforts, on foreign policy and immigration, and at the ballot box - have faced notable setbacks in recent days. the white house on thursday felt a bit like a building battening down for a coming storm. the four big posters showing americas reciprocal tariffs on a long list of countries were on prominent display in the press briefing room, but administration officials available to respond to media questions were few and far between. out on pennsylvania avenue, workers unloaded pallets of metal fencing, which will ring the white house grounds in preparation for what officials anticipate to be a large anti-trump demonstration at the nearby washington monument on saturday. the first lady announced that a white house garden tour event that had been scheduled for that day was postponed because of security concerns. even the normally loquacious president stopped only briefly to talk with the crush of reporters on his way to board the marine one helicopter on the first leg of his journey to florida. i said this would be exactly the way it is, he declared when asked about the days stock market turmoil. the markets - and america as a whole - would soon boom, he said. the president, it seems, is willing to wait out the tempest created by his tariff plan. he appears confident that his economic vision of a rebuilt, job-rich american manufacturing sector protected from foreign competition - a vision he has closely held for decades - will ultimately be proven right. the trump agendas close encounter with cold, hard reality wasnt limited to trade this week, however. his two top foreign policy priorities - ending the wars in gaza and ukraine - both appear mired in the kind of messy details and conflicting agendas that often obstruct lasting peace. israel has once again moved into gaza and escalated a bombing campaign that is generating reports of widespread civilian casualties. the ceasefire that trump touted in the days before he took office appears to be in tatters. russia, meanwhile, continues to pile new conditions on to negotiations for a full ceasefire with ukraine, which is an indication that the nation may be buying time to allow its ground forces to take more territory. if i think theyre tapping us along, i will not be happy about it, trump said of russia. but he added that he still believes president vladimir putin wants to make a deal. evidence so far indicates the contrary, according to jake sullivan, who was president joe bidens national security adviser. in an interview with the bbc, he accused trump of handing russia most of its demands, though he acknowledged it was still early in the process and things could yet change. so the current dynamic in these negotiations a is not in fact producing russian willingness to reach a fair and just compromise, but b is actually stimulating a view in moscow that if they just keep holding out, theyre just going to keep getting concessions from the united states. and so far that is what has happened. even trumps deportation and immigration enforcement efforts, which still have high public support, have been at least partially derailed by legal challenges. while his administration has successfully completed several flights transferring alleged tren de aragua venezuelan gang members to an el salvadoran high-security prison, the judge presiding over a case challenging those deportations said on thursday there was a fair likelihood officials had violated his court order to turn the flights around. other court challenges - to trumps suspension of political asylum processing and refugee resettlement, his attempt to end birthright citizenship and his revocation of temporary protected status for about 350,000 venezuelans - are currently working their way through the us legal system. at some point, the us supreme court is expected to weigh in on many of these disputes. this week also marked the biggest round of elections since trumps november 2024 victory, as voters headed to the polls in wisconsin to elect a state judge and in two florida special elections for seats in the house of representatives. while the republican candidates in florida prevailed, their winning margins were about 15, which is about half of what trump posted in those congressional districts in november. in wisconsin, a key political battleground state, the democratic-backed candidate won. democrats were able to maintain the liberal majority on the court despite the tens of millions of dollars spent by conservative groups, including by tech billionaire elon musk, who campaigned there in person. taken as a whole the results suggest that democrats are doing well in hotly contested races and may be making inroads even in reliably conservative areas - in part by campaigning against musk and his efforts to massively cut federal programmes and staff. that could be an indication that the party will have the political wind at their backs in state elections this november and the midterm congressional elections next year. the stock market tumult, and those ballot-box results, may be behind a few scattered signs of dissent within republican ranks. ted cruz, an arch-conservative senator from texas, said on his podcast on friday that trumps tariffs could hurt jobs and could hurt america - particularly if other nations retaliate, as china has already done. if were in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now, with massive american tariffs, and massive tariffs on american goods in every other country on earth, that is a terrible outcome, he continued. on wednesday night in the us senate, four republicans joined with democrats to support rescinding the emergency declaration that justifies trumps earlier canada tariffs. and on thursday, republican senator chuck grassley of iowa joined with democrat maria cantwell of washington to back a measure that would require congress to directly approve tariffs that stay in effect longer than 60 days. republicans by and large have been sticking with the president. they seem unwilling, or unable, to sway trump from his current course on tariffs and government cuts and appear fearful of the political consequences of breaking with the man who has a vise-like grip on the party. but if the current economic shock becomes a long-term hardship, and if government programme cuts translate into tangible disruptions in popular services or if trumps standing in opinion polls continues to sag, members of his own party may begin eyeing the exit signs for the first time in years. and that would bring an unceremonious end to some of trumps most ambitious efforts. trump, no longer worried about standing before voters, may feel liberated from the immediate political consequences of his actions - but reality has a way of asserting itself in the end.

  Title: Trump announces huge new tariffs to promote US manufacturing, risking inflation and trade wars
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 20:57:51)
  Content: by josh boak associated press washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the new tariffs, coming on what trump has named liberation day, are a bid to boost u.s. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he says are years of unfair trade practices. but by most economists assessments, the move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and upend decades-old alliances. the white house is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble. april 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern american history, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said tuesday. she said the new tariffs would take effect immediately. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. based on the possibility of broad 20 tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. because trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. leavitt is among three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the associated press on first and fifth amendment grounds. the ap says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. the white house says the ap is not following an executive order to refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america. associated press writers mike householder in oldcastle, ontario, sylvie corbet in paris and lisa mascaro contributed to this report.

that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the tariffs follow similar recent announcements of 25 taxes on auto imports levies against china, canada and mexico and expanded trade penalties on steel and aluminum. trump has also imposed tariffs on countries that import oil from venezuela and he plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose have caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy, despite the risk of political backlash as voters in last years election said they wanted trump to combat inflation. senior administration officials, who insisted on anonymity to preview the new tariffs with reporters ahead of trumps speech, said the taxes would raise hundreds of billions of dollars annually in revenues. they said the 10 baseline rate existed to help ensure compliance, while the higher rates were based on the trade deficits run with other nations and then halved to reach the numbers that trump presented in the rose garden. in a follow-up series of questions by the associated press, the white house could not say whether the tariff exemptions on imports worth 800 or less would remain in place, possibly shielding some imports from the new taxes. based on the possibility of broad tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most outside analyses by banks and think tanks see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnating growth. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses

  Title: Americans braced for era of uncertainty as Trump doubles down on tariffs
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-06 12:00:50)
  Content: since donald trump returned to the white house, americans have grown used to high drama and rapid-fire headlines, as executive orders from the oval office have reshaped the us, from stripping back lgbtq rights to gutting environmental regulations amid a sense that the us is slipping into authoritarianism. but even against that backdrop, last week stood out, as trump launched a fierce global trade war, imposed tariffs on its trading partners and triggered a global market meltdown, including on trumps own cherished wall street, where hundreds of billions of dollars of stock values evaporated. now, with all eyes nervously on mondays markets amid fears that the calamitous drops will continue, recession fears are mounting in america. jp morgan analysts last week boosted their odds on a global recession to 60 and americans are bracing for a return of inflation the thing that above all else likely doomed trumps predecessor, joe biden. but trump remained unmoved by market drops and the global political condemnation and even rare criticism from his own republican party saying now is a great time to get rich and that china played it wrong they panicked. on the streets of new york too, there was panic among some. in washington square park, two sisters from detroit were sitting on a park bench nearby the magnolia trees now in bloom. kathleen, a primary school teacher, said she worried about whether there was a plan in place before changes are made. i want to be optimistic, but i live under an umbrella of worry with this administration, kathleen said. i worry about the leadership, worry about a lack of continuity within the leadership, and so many changes at once without a plan. her sister, elizabeth, said shed grown so anxious shed stepped back from the news. our mum definitely had a huge jump in anxiety over this past week over her investments. she worked hard for those and she lives on them a retired schoolteacher, and the drop in stocks very much impacts her day-to-day feeling of security. but leo ezekiel, 39, had a different perspective. as a financier, he wasnt so worried about the stock markets. its mostly that big corporations are deciding to sell off, and that will affect people, but in the long run, if stocks go down, it gives room for them to move up. its part of the game and its always been like that in the united states. trump made his move because he dreams of a return of american manufacturing might, convinced that tariffs will force factories home to the us, even though almost all economists think that is highly unlikely. yet, for such a momentous decision which has rattled the entire world economy, trump reportedly only made up his mind at the last minute. according to the washington post, trump didnt arrive on an exact plan until just three hours before the rose garden announcement. the liberation day announcement from the white house was a choreographed event, and his speech drew cheers from audience, largely made up cabinet members and blue-collar workers from manufacturing sectors that have for decades been economically pummeled by foreign competition. he offered up a vision that tariffs would bring back an older american economy, reopening factories and returning prosperity to ordinary workers. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump complained. but it is not going to happen any more. vice-president jd vance said weve seen closing factories, weve seen rising inflation. weve seen the cost of housing so high that most americans cant afford to buy a home right now, vance said. president trump is taking this economy in a different direction. americas largest trading partners, mexico, canada, china, germany and japan, were less enthusiastic, to say the least. china has announced retaliatory duties of 34 the canadian prime minister mark carney announced a limited set of counter-measures and called the us moves a tragedy for 80 years of free and open exchange of goods and services, led by the us. the british pm keir starmer said nothing would be off the table when it came to the uks response to the tariffs the uk imports 76.2bn in us services but that just as with defence and security the world was entering a new era in economy and trade. it is one where answers to even the most basic questions remain unknown. will trumps tariffs on us trade partners go down as an act of economic self-sabotage? or are tariffs merely a negotiating ploy to influence other nations war by other means? or is trump finally getting to express his long-held economic view that the us has been making bad deals for decades?

doesnt give a fuck. hes going to do what hes going to do. hes going to do what he promised to do on the campaign trail. but even some former trump economic officials privately expressed doubts that returning the us to an era of manufacturing self-sufficiency was likely impossible. the author michael wolff, who has published four books about trump in power, says the us president will now be keenly gauging how his interruption into global trade norms is going down, with updates and live-action replays provided by aides. trump, wolff says, is likely caught between two opposing instincts. its great for him hes dominating the news once again. nobody is talking about anything else except tariffs. suddenly, tariffs, an arcane piece of trade policy, are the most dramatic thing in the world that hes imbued with reality-show stuff. hell be really pleased with that. but on the other hand, wolff predicts, trump will be watching the financial markets. hell have the business guys calling up saying what the fuck are you doing? im sure he hasnt come to any conclusion. so on the one hand its great hes the worlds leading guy again. on the other, it might collapse in on him. and that, he adds, is the essence of trump. hes fundamentally self-destructive, but that self-destructive impulse is exactly what keeps him at the forefront of the news.

  Title: Team Trump defends tariffs as bipartisan opposition grows, markets slide
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-06 18:36:37)
  Content: trump administration officials blitzed television networks sunday to defend the presidents massive tariffs that have caused a sell-off in the stock market and triggered recession fears, arguing that the import taxes are already forcing dozens of countries to come to the bargaining table. fifty countries were burning the phone lines into the white house to negotiate with president donald trump, agriculture secretary brooke rollins told cnns state of the union. dont panic, white house senior counselor peter navarro said on fox newss sunday morning futures. and treasury secretary scott bessent, speaking on nbcs meet the press, dismissed predictions from economists and banks that there would be a recession. the full-court press from cabinet members and advisers came as the administration is under immense pressure to pull back on the tariffs, which have caused the biggest loss in american stock market wealth since the panicked sell-off as covid-19 spread in march 2020. a growing number of conservatives are pushing back against trumps moves, with a nonprofit backed by right-wing megadonor charles koch leading a lawsuit against the tariffs, while some republicans in both chambers of congress are organizing a legislative effort to roll them back. and though administration officials remain in lockstep in their support of trump, some of the presidents most vocal supporters are beginning to question the moves. speaking via video call to a conference of italian right-wing politicians on saturday, billionaire trump funder elon musk said he hopes europe and the united states will eliminate all tariffs between them. hedge-fund investor bill ackman, a regular defender of trump, said on x on saturday that he thinks the president will delay the tariffs on monday as trump works through negotiations with countries that are willing to lower their own trade barriers. the risk of not doing so is that the massive increase in uncertainty drives the economy into a recession, potentially a severe one, ackman wrote. ben shapiro, the right-wing pundit and co-founder of the daily wire, called the tariffs probably unconstitutional and illogical, and the wall street journals editorial board, as well as guests on fox news, have criticized the tariffs. meanwhile, liberal politicians are lambasting the president, as did tens of thousands of protesters who took to the streets of washington and cities around the country on saturday in what appeared to be the biggest demonstrations against trump since he took office in january. trump hanging tough still, trump is holding the course. on saturday, he implored followers on his social media platform truth social to hang tough. this is an economic revolution, and we will win, he said. trump administration officials offered two main justifications for the tariffs, saying they are meant to accomplish the long-term goal of completely reforming the american economy while giving the u.s. increased negotiating power to strike new trade deals. this is the ultimate dealmaker who is a businessman at the head of our government, rollins said. at the same time, the agriculture secretary framed the tariffs as part of a long-overdue new american order to protect u.s. industries. though she insisted the dip was a product of the markets adjusting, rollins acknowledged short-term uncertainty for american farmers, noting that the white house is ready to deploy financial aid to them if needed. some of the countries criticized by trump for putting tariffs on american imports, such as india, do so to keep prices stable for their own farmers. financial analysts from global banks, including barclays, bank of america, deutsche bank and the royal bank of canada, have all said the u.s. stands a higher chance of entering into a recession if the tariffs are not pulled back. j.p. morgan economists and analysts see a 60 percent chance of a recession happening this year. but bessent said sunday that the economy remains strong. there doesnt have to be a recession, bessent said, calling the 6 trillion stock-market drop a short-term reaction and comparing the current moment to the early days of ronald reagans presidency. he also rejected warnings from economists and skeptical fellow republicans, arguing that the tariffs are a one-time price adjustment and not a source of lasting inflation. bessent declined to say whether the tariffs are permanent but said they have given trump maximum leverage to renegotiate trade terms. the market consistently underestimates donald trump, he added. were going to hold the course. navarro, for his part, told americans to hold on to their stock portfolios despite cratering share prices. right now the smart strategy is not to panic, just stay in, because we are going to have the biggest boom in the stock market we have ever seen under the trump policies, he said sunday. we will find a bottom in this market quickly. we will hit 50,000 on the dow easily by the end of this term. the dow jones industrial average, a basket of stocks representing 30 big, well-known companies, hit an all-time high of just over 45,000 in december. it was at around 38,000 when the market closed friday which came on the heels of the worst quarter for stocks since spring 2022. meanwhile, gop opposition to the tariffs is growing. rep. don bacon r-nebraska said sunday on cbss face the nation that on monday he will unveil some of the support for his house bill, a companion to a senate bill that aims to bring back control of tariffs to congress. the move is notable because the house has already passed a procedural vote to prevent the chamber from voting on any proposed bill ending trumps emergency declaration on tariffs against mexico, canada and china. it will be harder to pass this in the house, no doubt, bacon conceded. i think if we get 60 votes in the senate itll put pressure on the house to look at this, and if we continue to see the stock market go in a certain direction or if we see inflation or unemployment shift in a bad way, i think this bill becomes very viable. people voted for trump because of inflation, immigration and crime, he noted, adding, i dont think tariffs was really a big factor in peoples decision-making in electing him last november. while trumps cabinet members claimed that dozens of countries are trying to reach the president to negotiate, democrats seized on the fact that trump had spent some of the weekend playing golf. that may end up being the most enduring image of the trump presidency, sen. adam schiff d-california said on nbcs meet the press. the president out on a golf cart while peoples retirement is in flames. while theres growing bipartisan support in congress to rein in trumps tariff authority, the moment demands immediate action, schiff added.

  Title: Trump threatens more tariffs on China as global markets shudder over how much pain economy can take
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-10 20:33:10)
  Content: follow live updates on the global markets washington ap undeterred by a panicked stock market, president donald trump threatened additional tariffs on china on monday, raising fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war. trumps threat came after china said it would retaliate against u.s. tariffs he announced last week. if china does not withdraw its 34 increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, april 8th, 2025, the united states will impose additional tariffs on china of 50, effective april 9th, trump wrote on truth social. additionally, all talks with china concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! the u.s. president has shown few signs of backing down on tariffs despite the mounting pressure in the financial markets. his commitment to tariffs could have devastating effects for the global economy, even though trump is banking that it will ultimately pay off with manufacturing jobs. asked monday if he would consider a pause on his widespread tariffs, trump said, were not looking at that. the u.s. president said he was open to negotiations if we can make a really fair deal and a good deal for the united states. trump added that its possible to have both negotiated settlements with other countries and permanent tariffs. even as israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said his country would take its tariffs against u.s. goods to zero, trump was noncommittal about removing the new import taxes placed on an ally. the white house also said monday that trump would veto a senate bill that would mandate congressional approval for new tariffs, a bet that the critical mass of republican lawmakers will loyally back him despite the economic and political risks. however, there are signs of frustration even among trumps allies. sen. john kennedy, a louisiana republican, said he supports the presidents goals of better trade deals but worries about the economic uncertainty. we dont know if the medicine will be worse than the disease, kennedy said, adding, this is president trumps economy now. if trump implements his new taxes on imports from china, u.s. tariffs on chinese goods would reach a combined 104. the new taxes would be on top of the 20 tariffs announced as punishment for fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34 tariffs announced last week. not only could that increase prices for american consumers, it could also give china an incentive to flood other countries with cheaper goods and seek deeper relationships with other trading partners. china responded angrily and said it would not back down. the u.s. threat to escalate tariffs on china is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the u.s., said a statement from the commerce ministry in beijing. china will never accept this. if the u.s. insists on its own way, china will fight to the end. after sell-offs on the prior two days of trading, the dow jones industrial average on monday fell 0.9. the sp 500 slumped 0.2, and the nasdaq composite was up 0.1. trump frequently bragged about stock market gains during his first term, and the threat of losses on wall street was viewed as a potential guardrail on risky economic policies in his second term. but that hasnt been the case, and trump has described days of financial pain as necessary. i dont mind going through it because i see a beautiful picture at the end, he said. trump officials have frequently appeared on television to make the case for his policies, but none of their explanations have calmed the markets. the only improvement came from a false report that top economic adviser kevin hassett said trump was considering a pause on all tariffs except for china. stock prices spiked before the white house denied it was true by calling the post fake news. the republican president has remained defiant despite fears that he could be pushing the u.s. toward a recession, insisting that his tariffs are necessary for rebuilding domestic manufacturing and resetting trade relationships with other countries. but his aggressive push has scrambled u.s. economic policy. even though inflation remains elevated, trump has called on the federal reserve to lower its benchmark interest rates that were increased to constrain price increases. federal reserve chair jerome powell warned friday that the tariffs could increase inflation, and he said, theres a lot of waiting and seeing going on, including by us, before any decisions would be made. european commission president ursula von der leyen said the european union would focus on trade with other countries besides the united states, saying there are vast opportunities elsewhere. trump said he spoke with japanese prime minister shigeru ishiba to start trade negotiations. he complained on truth social they have treated the u.s. very poorly on trade and they dont take our cars, but we take millions of theirs. ishiba said he told trump that hes strongly concerned that tariffs would discourage investment from japan, which has been the worlds biggest investor in the u.s. in the past five years. he described the situation as a national crisis and said his government would negotiate with washington to urge trump to reconsider the tariffs. white house trade adviser peter navarro suggested countries would need to do much more than simply lower their own tariff rates to reach deals, an indication that talks could be a drawn-out process. lets take vietnam, he said on cnbc. when they come to us and say, well go to zero tariffs, that means nothing to us because its the non-tariff cheating that matters. meeting with trump at the white house on monday, netanyahu said his country would remove tariffs and other trade barriers in response to the u.s. placing 17 taxes on imports from israel. israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same, netanyahu told the u.s. president. trump said he appreciated very much what netanyahu had said. but when asked if he would remove the tariffs, trump said maybe not because of the aid that the united states provides to israel. the u.s. had a 7.4 billion trade deficit in goods last year with israel, according to the census bureau. trump has strived for a united front after the chaotic infighting of his first term. however, the economic turbulence has exposed some fractures among his supporters. bill ackman, a hedge fund manager, assailed commerce secretary howard lutnick on sunday as indifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing. on monday, ackman apologized for his criticism claiming that lutnick, previously the head of the financial firm cantor fitzgerald, could benefit from the tariffs because of its bond investments. but the hedge fund manager also reiterated his concerns about trumps tariffs. i am just frustrated watching what i believe to be a major policy error occur after our country and the president have been making huge economic progress that is now at risk due to the tariffs, he wrote on x. billionaire elon musk, a top adviser to trump on overhauling the federal government, expressed skepticism about tariffs over the weekend. musk has said that tariffs would drive up costs for tesla, his electric automaker. i hope it is agreed that both europe and the united states should move ideally in my view to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between europe and north america, musk said in a video conference with italian politicians. navarro later told fox news sunday morning futures that musk doesnt understand the situation. he sells cars, navarro said. thats what he does. he added, hes simply protecting his own interests as any businessperson would do. ___ associated press writers didi tang and stephen groves in washington and mari yamaguchi in tokyo contributed to this report. ___ follow the aps coverage of

  Title: Trump Is Defiant as Tariff Moves Roil Markets a Second Day
  Source: www.nytimes.com (2025-04-04 23:50:21)
  Content: two days after president trump announced his expansive global tariffs, the united states confronted wide-ranging and painful blowback, as china retaliated against american goods and markets plummeted again on worries of a persistent, damaging trade war. no portion of the global economy appeared unscathed as the world braced for mr. trump to begin imposing his nearly across-the-board taxes on imports saturday, marking the first salvo in a potentially costly trade conflict that the president has vigorously defended. china, which mr. trump has already hit with 20 percent tariffs, announced plans to retaliate. beijing promised to impose a 34 percent tariff on american goods next week, including on agricultural products. china calibrated its tariffs to match mr. trumps decision to add a 34 percent tax to chinese imports. the tit-for-tat delivered a huge blow to financial markets, as wall street reckoned with the rising odds of an escalating global trade standoff. by the closing bell, the sp 500 had fallen by almost 6 percent, pulling it closer into a bear market, a widely used wall street term for a decline of at least 20 percent from its peak. the tech-heavy nasdaq fell 5.8 percent, pushing it into bear market territory. as china took aim at the united states, ngozi okonjo-iweala, the director general of the world trade organization, warned on friday against a cycle of retaliatory measures that lead to further declines in trade. in the united states, jerome h. powell, the chair of the federal reserve, struck his own downbeat note over the unpredictable trajectory of the economy. while uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected, mr. powell said. the same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth. but mr. trump responded to the day of chaos by striking a defiant tone. having decamped from washington to mar-a-lago, his home in florida, he declared on truth social my policies will never change. instead, the president insisted in another post that his strategy was already working, as he held up a newly released and better-than-expected jobs report, which reflected u.s. hiring increased in the month before the announcement of his tariffs. at one point, the president even circulated another users video that argued trump is purposely crashing the market, in a bid to force the fed to lower interest rates. he later called on mr. powell to do just that, demanding that the independent chair of the central bank stop playing politics. and mr. trump eventually turned his attention to china, attacking the country for having played it wrong by retaliating against the united states. the president and his aides previously have signaled they could ratchet up their tariff rates if other nations look to exact retribution on u.s. goods. the global scramble in many ways underscored the weight of mr. trumps tariffs and the significance of his grand aspirations to recalibrate the global trading system. the white house sees these levies as critical toward resetting u.s. trade relationships, which the president contends are unfair, while boosting u.s. manufacturing and raising new revenue. but the tariffs, which are taxes on imports, threaten to fall hard on businesses that could face new costs to produce their goods. that, in turn, could hammer consumers, who are likely to shoulder the burden of any price increases. economists widely believe the result could be a rising rate of inflation, and a slowdown in consumer spending and business investment, which together crimp u.s. growth and push the economy into a recession. markets are expressing a vote of no confidence in the new tariff regime, said joe brusuelas, the principal and chief economist at the consulting firm rsm. he added that mr. trumps commentary on friday only adds to the consternation and concern that theres no strategic road map. but mr. trump and his top aides have swatted away those dour projections in recent days. fanning across cable news, they have dismissed the ebb and flow of the markets and acknowledged the possibility that tariffs could create short-term economic pain, which the president has likened to a sick patients painful yet necessary medical operation. the administration and its conservative allies have also labored to deflect criticism from economists, repeatedly portraying them as naysayers who had wrongly judged the presidents agenda in the past. i think its very clear the rhetoric of the economic community, in particular, is almost entirely ideological and out of proportion to the actual sort of risk-reward calculation, oren cass, the chief economist at american compass, a conservative economic think tank, said friday. global leaders, american politicians and others rejected that view, saying mr. trumps approach threatened to weaken the global economy and send prices soaring just as much of the world was finally returning to a sense of balance after two years of rapid inflation. ms. okonjo-iweala, the director general of the w.t.o., warned in a statement friday that mr. trumps policies could lead to an overall contraction of around 1 percent in global merchandise trade volumes this year, representing a downward revision of nearly four percentage points from previous projections. the state of california signaled it would try to negotiate its own trade deals, as gov. gavin newsom, a democrat, looked to protect local agriculture and other businesses. in a statement, mr. newsom said the presidents tactics would be felt in pretty profound ways to real people, including those who voted for donald trump and are now being betrayed by this very administration. even video games could not escape the fray japans nintendo announced that it would delay presales of its widely anticipated upcoming console, the switch 2, as it cited a need to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. mr. trump has said japan will face a 24 percent tariff on its exports to the united states. some foreign governments also mounted a last-minute scramble to figure out how, or if, to retaliate, while trying to persuade washington to relax its coming taxes on imports. maros sefcovic, the trade commissioner for the european union, said friday that he had a frank exchange with mr. trumps trade emissaries, posting on the social-media site x, i was clear us tariffs are damaging, unjustified. earlier friday, mr. trump said he had spoken by phone with to lam, the general secretary of the communist party of vietnam, which stands to see a 46 percent tariff on its exports to the united states beginning next week. by mr. trumps telling, vietnam wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s., though the president did not explicitly say if he would accept such a deal. the trump administration has sent mixed signals over its willingness to cut a deal some of mr. trumps advisers have said they do not intend to haggle, but the president himself told reporters earlier in the week that he could be open to negotiation if the united states received something phenomenal in return for relaxing tariffs. reporting was contributed by ana swanson, laurel rosenhall, colby smith, zachary small and keith bradsher.
