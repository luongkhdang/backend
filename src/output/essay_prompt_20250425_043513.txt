  Title: Tariff turmoil: How Tesla and other companies are dealing with the uncertainty of the trade war
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-23 22:23:02)
  Content: new york ap uncertainty over tariffs and an unpredictable trade war is weighing heavily on companies as they report their latest financial results and try to give investors financial forecasts. some tariffs remain in place against key u.s. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. the tariff and trade picture has been shifting for months, sometimes changing drastically on a daily basis. those shifts make it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales. on tuesday, treasury secretary scott bessent said he expects a de-escalation in the trade war between the u.s. and china, but cautioned that talks between the two sides had yet to formally start. heres how several big companies are dealing with the tariff confusion tesla tesla is in a better position than most car companies to deal with tariffs because it makes most of its u.s. cars domestically. but it still sources materials from other nations and will face import taxes. the bigger impact will be seen in the companys energy business. the company said the impact will be outsized because it sources lfp battery cells from china. the broader trade war could also hurt the company as china, the worlds largest electric vehicle market, retaliates against the u.s. tesla was forced earlier this month to stop taking orders from mainland customers for two models, its model s and model x. it makes the model y and model 3 for the chinese market at its factory in shanghai. ceo elon musk, an adviser to president donald trump, on tuesday reiterated that he believes lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity. but he added that ultimately the president decides on what tariffs to impose. akzo nobel the amsterdam-based maker of paints and coatings for industrial and commercial use said the big risk from tariffs could come in the form of lower demand for its products. the company said almost all sales of finished goods in the u.s. were locally produced, with the majority of raw materials locally sourced. over the years, we deliberately localized both our procurement and production in the u.s., said ceo gregoire poux-guillaume, in a conference call with analysts. we also largely run china for china and use the rest of asia instead as an export base. the companys products range from paints and coatings for the automotive industry to the do-it-yourself homeowner. broader tariffs could squeeze consumers and businesses and hurt sales. boston scientific the medical device maker said it expects most of the effecs of tariffs to hit the company during the second half of the year, but that it can absorb the impact. the company raised its earnings and revenue forecasts for the year, despite the tariffs. it estimates a 200 million impact from tariffs in 2025, but said it can offset that through higher sales and reductions in discretionary spending. the company said it has a long-standing supply chain around the globe and has made significant investments in the u.s. boeing boeing said much of its supply chain is in the u.s. and many of its imports from canada and mexico are exempt from tariffs under an existing trade agreement. the company does have suppliers in japan and italy, but it expects to recover those tariff costs. the net annual cost of higher tariffs on the supply chain is less than 500 million. a bigger concern is the potential for retaliatory tariffs, which could impact its ability to deliver aircraft. china, a key target for u.s. tariffs, has retaliated in part by no longer accepting deliveries of boeing aircraft. att att, like its peers in the telecommunications sector, faces higher costs for cellphones and other equipment. the company said it believes it can manage anticipated higher costs, based on the current pause in some tariffs and its supply chain. the magnitude of any increase will depend on a variety of factors, including how much of the tariffs the vendors pass on, the impact that the tariffs have on consumer and business demand, said ceo john stankey, on a conference call with analysts.

  Title: Pope Francisâ€™ conservative critics had a unique way to oppose him: a retired pontiff
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-22 16:36:55)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article highlights how Pope Francis's critics actively worked to shape the narrative surrounding his papacy, using various platforms like social media and conferences. 'From individual protests to social media campaigns, conferences and petitions, conservatives made clear they believed themselves to be more catholic than the pope and forged unusually vocal resistance to his authority.' This demonstrates an attempt to influence public perception and potentially sway future papal elections.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Francis's tolerance of right-wing opposition, even seeming to 'relish in the criticism as evidence of how far a church obsessed with rules and regulations had strayed from jesus gospel-mandated call.' This raises the question: Was this tolerance genuine, or a calculated strategy to highlight the perceived rigidity of his opposition and further legitimize his reforms?

  Content: vatican city ap as amazonian bishops gathered at the vatican on oct. 21, 2019, a man entered a nearby church after dawn and stole three indigenous statues brought to rome for the occasion. he threw them into the tiber river in a videotaped protest to denounce what he called the pagan idolatry taking place on pope francis watch. the incident underscored the lengths to which pope francis traditionalist critics were willing to go to vent their opposition to historys first latin american pope. from individual protests to social media campaigns, conferences and petitions, conservatives made clear they believed themselves to be more catholic than the pope and forged unusually vocal resistance to his authority. their token leaders in the college of cardinals will likely be maneuvering to ensure someone more sympathetic to their sensibilities will be elected to replace francis, who died monday at 88. some wanted me dead every pope has his critics. and francis probably expected he would face opposition to his radical reform agenda after catholics for two generations grew used to more conservative popes. some wanted me dead, he quipped once after he heard some prelates in rome had started plotting a future conclave while he was in the hospital. francis critics were unique in having a living alternate as a point of reference, pope benedict xvi, who resided as pope emeritus in the vatican gardens for the first decade of francis pontificate. such an anomaly made the dynamics of the francis opposition a historical first. it exacerbated divisions that experts say must be addressed before another pope decides to step down. they say norms are necessary to prevent a retired pope from being an inspiration for the faithful in ways that discredit his successor or impact his leadership. francis tolerated the right-wing opposition for a while, often responding to their attacks with silence. at times, he even seemed to relish in the criticism as evidence of how far a church obsessed with rules and regulations had strayed from jesus gospel-mandated call to welcome the stranger, feed the poor and show mercy to all. its an honor if the americans attack me, he once said, referring to the u.s.-based nexus of opposition. after benedicts death in 2022, francis tried to blunt the opposition and consolidate his progressive reforms, even though it seemed the right-wing knives were out for him. within days of benedicts funeral, his longtime secretary published a tell-all memoir highly critical of francis. it also emerged posthumously that cardinal george pell wrote a devastating memo that circulated anonymously, calling francis pontificate a catastrophe. while saying he welcomed criticism, francis tried to neutralize the opposition through key appointments and targeted removals, even while trying to make the church a welcoming field hospital for wounded souls, especially lgbtq catholics. after one gesture of outreach francis approved blessings for same-sex couples african bishops united in disapproval in a remarkable continent-wide dissent to a papal directive. if you look at all the history of the reform of the church, where you have the strongest resistance or debated points, its really usually a very important point, said sister nathalie becquart, who helped spearhead one of francis progressive agenda items to make the church more responsive to the needs of laypeople. wary of francis from the start conservative and traditionalist catholics were wary of francis after their beloved benedict became the first pope in 600 years to resign. they grimaced when francis emerged on the loggia of st. peters basilica after his 2013 election without the ermine-rimmed, red velvet cape of his predecessors. they gasped a few weeks later when he washed the feet of women and muslims on holy thursday, a ritual previously restricted to men. we dont like this pope, headlined italys conservative daily il foglio a few months into his papacy. the dictator pope was the title of book by a british traditionalist published a few years later. over time, the critics worst fears came true. one breaking point came in 2016, when francis opened the door to letting divorced and civilly remarried catholics receive communion. some accused francis of heresy. four conservative cardinals formally asked him to clarify himself, issuing dubia or questions to him. they argued church doctrine held that catholics who remarried without a church annulment were living in sin and couldnt receive the sacraments. he never replied. reversing benedict on the latin mass conservatives could not have known that francis would take one of the most controversial steps of his pontificate by reimposing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass that benedict had relaxed. the reversal of benedicts signature liturgical legacy was evidence that francis had essentially declared war on traditionalists, the ancient liturgy and benedicts papacy itself. francis hates us. francis hates tradition. francis hates all that is good and beautiful, the traditionalist blog rorate caeli tweeted. but it concluded francis will die, the latin mass will live forever. francis insisted his aim was to preserve church unity. critics accused him of the opposite, of driving a wedge, and the outrage wasnt limited to u.s.-based conservative catholic media or fringe right-wing bloggers who had popularized francis-bashing. cardinal raymond burke, one of the dubia prelates whom francis sacked early on as the vaticans supreme court justice, blasted the severity of the papal crackdown. guinean cardinal robert sarah, the vaticans retired liturgy chief, responded with tweets quoting benedicts original 2007 law to relax the restrictions that francis had overturned. they were accompanied by a photo of benedict wearing the red cape that francis had eschewed the night of his election. a year earlier, sarah orchestrated a media firestorm by persuading benedict to co-author a book reaffirming priestly celibacy at a time when francis was considering ordaining married men to address a clergy shortage in the amazon. the book, and the prospect of a retired pope trying to influence a reigning one, created the nightmare scenario that canon lawyers and theologians had warned of in 2013, when benedict decided to retain the white cassock of the papacy in retirement and call himself emeritus pope, rather than revert to his birth name. the scandal died down after benedict removed himself as a co-author and francis fired his secretary, archbishop georg gaenswein, believed to have been behind it. after benedict died and gaenswein penned his highly critical, tell-all memoir nothing but the truth, francis exiled him from the vatican. then, after a time in his native germany, made him an ambassador. after burke joined a bigger group of cardinals questioning francis 2023 synod on the churchs future, francis cut him off financially. francis was more tolerant with another critic, the retired archbishop of hong kong, cardinal joseph zen. he excoriated the pope for agreeing in 2018 to a deal with china over the nomination of bishops, accusing francis of selling out chinas underground catholics who stayed loyal to the holy see during decades of persecution. francis received zen at the vatican and later called him a tender soul. francis won few friends with his frequent denunciations of clericalism the idea that priests should be put on a pedestal. he made it a tradition to use his christmas greeting to publicly shame vatican bureaucrats, accusing them of being careerist, money-grubbing gossips with spiritual alzheimers. german cardinal gerhard mueller complained that francis treated vatican monsignors like uneducated children. a major u.s. critic emerges francis biggest conservative critic was the vaticans former ambassador to the u.s., archbishop carlo maria vigano. in 2018, he said francis had covered up accusations that then-cardinal theodore mccarrick, an american, had slept with his seminarians. vigano demanded francis resign for allegedly rehabilitating mccarrick from sanctions imposed by benedict. the furor faded after francis defrocked mccarrick and vigano was discredited with conspiracy theories about covid-19. mccarrick died earlier this month. in 2024, francis excommunicated vigano after finding him guilty of schism. papal biographer austen ivereigh said francis dismantled much of the resistance. he lists the amazonian synod as a defining positive moment of his pontificate - not because of the incident with the statues but because the meeting emphasized his key pastoral priority of accompanying the faithful. the native peoples of amazonia were right here in st. peters square, and francis walked across to the synod with them, ivereigh said, recalling the feathered headdresses and indigenous statues that were on display. the pastor among his people, walking together. and i thought, that is him. that sums him up, he said.

to purchase, with higher broad-based tariffs, mcconnell said after his vote. center-right media hammered trump on thursday while us allies showed no signs of backing down and instead openly plotted their own tariff measures in response. a trade war appears imminent on the road ahead. assuming the policy sticksand we hope it doesntthe effort amounts to an attempt to remake the u.s. economy and the world trading system, the murdoch-owned wall street journal editorial board wrote thursday morning. if the response is widespread retaliation, the result could be shrinking world trade and slower growth, recession, or worse, the journal continued. there will certainly be higher costs for american consumers and businesses. on the bulwark, host jonathan last sarcastically quipped thursday the woke socialist markets do not seem to appreciate the brilliance of trumps beautiful, very strong tariffs. the white house fired out its own news release highlighting praise from a handful of industry trade groups, as well as republican members of congress. but over wednesday evening and thursday morning the media and economic experts spent the hours picking apart apparent inconsistencies and other confusing aspects of the liberation day announcement. a top target of ridicule for the white houses usual critics were the 10 percent duties levied on the heard and mcdonald islands, a remote pair of islands controlled by australia with no human population and extremely limited fishing activity, according to forbes. virtually zero exports from the penguin-infested rocks reach the us. impressed the crack white house economic team not only found the heard and mcdonald islandsan uninhabited australian territory which is a two week sail from the mainland requiring a permit to visitbut that they managed to figure out the optimal retaliatory tariff to impose on penguins, wrote justin wolfers, a senior fellow at the brookings institution. on consumer news channel cnbc, one reporter could not hide his disdain for the formula used to calculate the reciprocal tariffs put into place by the white house, which according to a number of economists did not appear to actually factor in tariffs put into place by us trade partners. i started calling international trade economic experts, steve liesman said on the network thursday morning. nobody ever heard of this formula. nobody has ever used this formula. so im sorry, but the conclusion seems to be that the president kind of made this up as he went along. he made it up. ian bremmer of the eurasia group, added this is incredibly stupid. yales nonpartisan budget lab was out with increasingly dire predictions for the us economy after the presidents announcement this week. clothing and apparel prices are set to spike by nearly 20 percent nationwide, according to an analysis published wednesday, while the overall economy will shrink and american households in the middle income bracket will be hit with an annual income loss of around 1,700. i expect the fallout to continue into next week, as everyone is trying to assess what the effect will be on final consumer prices, michael tamvakis, a professor and economist with city st. georges university of london, told the independent on thursday. i imagine any good not available in the domestic us market will be affected, especially any food commodities which have to be imported promptly and have a short shelf life, tamvakis predicted. electronics, pharmaceuticals and auto sales would be among the sectors affected immediately, he explained, with higher drug prices in particular having the potential to hurt poorer americans the most. with the trump administration under a self-acknowledged mandate to bring down consumer prices and inflation, the president could be setting republicans up in a very uncomfortable spot come midterm season. the state of the us economy is likely to be very close to the top of voters minds as congressional reelection campaigns begin in earnest next year and later in 2024, for some. high grocery prices and other issues caused by a trade war could easily lead voters to hand the house back to democratic control for the remainder of trumps term, even if the senate remains out of reach. the real danger trump faces could be from dividing the coalition which has now elected him twice traditional republican voters who want to see the us economy grow and thrive, and maga true believers who are willing to see a contraction if it means reorganizing the economy under an america first vision. democrats, of course, are counting on this as their party continues to grapple with a crisis of confidence. voters remain unhappy with congressional democrats, especially senate minority leader chuck schumer, amid the doge-ification of the federal government and the collapse of democratic resistance in the senate, both in the face of the laken riley act and more recent government shutdown fight. schumer, who saw his party shed three seats in the senate last year, maintains that he still has a winning record in terms of both elections and legislating. a tanking us economy could make that pronouncement a reality come next year. if trump doesnt see things turn around for the us economy before the end of the year, he could well end up handing schumer a lifeline right when his rival needs it most. join thought-provoking

  Title: Wall Street reacts to Trump's reciprocal tariffs

  Content: reuters -president donald trump said on wednesday he would impose a 10 baseline tariff on all imports to the united states and higher duties on some of the countrys biggest trading partners, a move that could escalate a trade war and upend the global economy. trading partners are expected to respond with countermeasures that could lead to dramatically higher prices for everything from bicycles to wine. u.s. automakers are looking at steps they can take in the shorter term to mitigate tariffs, such as working with suppliers on any items that can be moved to the u.s. quickly without significant investment. but massive longer-term investment decisions require more time and certainty. the current u.s. automakers playbook is not enough, and they are facing a watershed moment. its an opportunity for automakers to do things differently. lean into emerging technology like ai across their business. explore and decide on alliances faster. speed up vehicle production cycle times. on the supply side, this watershed moment offers opportunity in the chaos for mergers and acquisitions. david mccall, president, united steelworkers usw international we must ensure our trade policy targets cheaters rather than trusted economic allies like canada. we should be working to build relationships - not barriers - with partners who have proven their commitment to joining us in tackling global overcapacity. the administration must also take steps to prevent companies from using tariffs as an excuse to price gouge consumers. nigel green, ceo, global financial advisory firm devere group this is how you sabotage the worlds economic engine while claiming to supercharge it. its a seismic day for global trade. trump is blowing up the post-war system that made the u.s. and the world more prosperous, and hes doing it with reckless confidence. tariffs are taxes - plain and simple - and american consumers will bear the brunt. the reality is stark, these tariffs will push prices higher on thousands of everyday goods - from phones to food - and that will fuel inflation at a time when it is already uncomfortably persistent. mike hawes, ceo, uks society of motor manufacturers and traders these tariff costs cannot be absorbed by manufacturers, thus hitting u.s. consumers who may face additional costs and a reduced choice of iconic british brands, whilst uk producers may have to review output in the face of constrained demand. seth goldstein, morningstar analyst on u.s. chemicals i see lower volumes as a result of tariffs. the tariffs will likely be passed along to raise price of end-market products to consumers. in turn, i expect we see consumers buy fewer goods. due to the high fixed-cost nature of chemicals production, lower volumes would have an outsized impact on profits, so we could see another year of declining profits if widespread tariffs are implemented. however, many chemical producers make their products in the u.s. to be sold domestically, so we see less of a direct impact. david french, executive vp of government relations at national retail federation more tariffs equal more anxiety and uncertainty for american businesses and consumers. tariffs are a tax paid by the u.s. importer that will be passed along to the end consumer. tariffs will not be paid by foreign countries or suppliers. we encourage president trump to hold trading partners accountable and restore fairness for american businesses without creating economic uncertainty and higher prices for american families. art wheaton, director of labor studies, ilr school, cornell university it will take years and billions of dollars to bring manufacturing jobs from new plants online, whereas expansions at existing factories could happen much sooner. however, companies prioritize stability - frequent policy changes can delay investment decisions as businesses wait for clearer, long-term signals before committing capital. michael ashley schulman, partner and cio at running point capital advisors possibly, trump in addition to bringing back manufacturing to the u.s. and leveraging our advanced robotics within our shores for that manufacturing renaissance, may also be trying to truly muck up the chinese economy and heighten their economic instability. 34 tariffs on chinese goods could either force many chinese manufacturers to close, increasing unemployment and social instability in china, andor force a temporary price level adjustment within the u.s. for chips, pcs, semiconductors and server manufacturers, these tariffs, if they hold, will be quite disruptive. investors, analysts, politicians, and the market will be on bated breath to see what is now negotiated between countries following this liberation day volley from the administration. hopefully, todays announcement is a worst case scenario, and any negotiations create improvements from here. with valuations skyrocketing in 2024, many investors are uneasy putting more money into stocks. unsure where to invest next?

  Title: Tariff turmoil: How Tesla and other companies are dealing with the uncertainty of the trade war
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-23 18:00:42)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article illustrates Realism through the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. The text states, 'the broader trade war could also hurt the company as china, the worlds largest electric vehicle market, retaliates against the u.s.' This demonstrates states (U.S. and China) acting in their self-interest, using economic tools (tariffs) as weapons in a power struggle. This interpretation suggests that economic policies are not solely driven by economic factors but are also tools for geopolitical competition.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'some tariffs remain in place against key u.s. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate.' This postponement, without specifying which tariffs or partners, is intriguing. What specific conditions or concessions are being sought during these negotiations, and why are some partners prioritized over others? This raises questions about the underlying power dynamics and strategic considerations driving the U.S.'s trade policy.

  Title: Trump announces huge new tariffs to promote US manufacturing, risking inflation and trade wars
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 20:57:51)
  Content: by josh boak associated press washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the new tariffs, coming on what trump has named liberation day, are a bid to boost u.s. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he says are years of unfair trade practices. but by most economists assessments, the move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and upend decades-old alliances. the white house is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble. april 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern american history, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said tuesday. she said the new tariffs would take effect immediately. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. based on the possibility of broad 20 tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. because trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. leavitt is among three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the associated press on first and fifth amendment grounds. the ap says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. the white house says the ap is not following an executive order to refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america. associated press writers mike householder in oldcastle, ontario, sylvie corbet in paris and lisa mascaro contributed to this report.

reacted with shock and concern on wednesday to the sweeping series of tariffs donald trump announced on all u.s. trading partners. despite the trump administration framing the measures as a way to bolster u.s. manufacturing, those within american industry warned the tariffs might do the opposite. manufacturers are scrambling to determine the exact implications for their operations, national association of manufacturers president and ceo jay timmons said in a statement on wednesday. the stakes for manufacturers could not be higher. the tariffs, which trump continues to erroneously claim will mean other countries paying the u.s., will in fact threaten investment, jobs, supply chains, and, in turn, americas ability to outcompete other nations and lead as the preeminent manufacturing superpower, according to timmons. other industry leaders had a similar outlook. the national restaurant association warned the tariffs will create change and disruption, as small business owners struggled with increased prices. many restaurant operators source as many domestic ingredients as they can, but its simply not possible for u.s. farmers and ranchers to produce the volumes needed to support consumer demand, the groups ceo michelle korsmo said in a statement. what we have heard from business of all sizes, across all industries, from around the country is that these broad tariffs are a tax increase that will raise prices for american consumers and hurt the economy, the u.s. chamber of commerce added in a statement of its own. this is catastrophic for american families, matt priest, president and chief executive of the footwear distributors and retailers of america, told the new york times. we had hoped the president would take a more targeted approach, but these broad tariffs will only drive-up costs, reduce product quality and weaken consumer confidence. political reaction to the tariff plan which includes 25 percent tariffs on imported autos, 10 percent baseline tariffs on all imports, and double-digit reciprocal tariffs on numerous individual nations was split on predictable partisan lines, though a handful of senate republicans joined all democrats in the upper house for a largely symbolic vote wednesday evening to reject the national emergency determination the trump administration has used to justify tariffs on canada. democratic critics of trump hammered the president, arguing the tariffs would do the opposite of the republicans campaign promises to lower prices and aid american families. rep. nydia velazquez of new york warned in a post on x directed at trump of the working families, small businesses, and everyday americans getting crushed by your half-baked trade war. others emphasized that the tariffs, which, despite trumps claims to the contrary, are paid by u.s. companies importing goods, functionally act as tax hikes on u.s. consumers. donald trump just imposed the largest tax hike in our lifetime, california governor gavin newsom said on wednesday on x. liberal political commentator jonathan chait argued in the atlantic that trump, whose tariff plans sent stocks declining after hours and raised fears of a recession, might become the first one to kill off a healthy economy through an almost universally foreseeable unforced error. some cheered the economic overhaul. hes resetting the negotiating table. hes resetting the deck here, rep. andy ogles, republican of tennessee, said in a video statement on wednesday, adding, at the end of the day, i know trump is going to be proactive. hes going to put america first and put american workers first, which is what we should do. todays tariff action will cement president trumps legacy as one that ushered in a new golden age of american industrialization and prosperity, nick iacovella of the coalition for a prosperous america said on x. absolutely massive day for those of us that care about strengthening our nations industrial capacity and creating working-class jobs. on the international front, leaders also showed concern. it is the american people who will pay the biggest price for these unjustified tariffs, australian prime minister anthony albanese said after trumps announcement. we will do everything we can to work towards an agreement with the united states, with the goal of avoiding a trade war that would inevitably weaken the west

and computer chips. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose have caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy, despite the risk of political backlash as voters in last years election said they wanted trump to combat inflation. senior administration officials, who insisted on anonymity to preview the new tariffs with reporters ahead of trumps speech, said the taxes would raise hundreds of billions of dollars annually in revenues. they said the 10 baseline rate existed to help ensure compliance, while the higher rates were based on the trade deficits run with other nations and then halved to reach the numbers that trump presented in the rose garden. in a follow-up series of questions by the associated press, the white house could not say whether the tariff exemptions on imports worth 800 or less would remain in place, possibly shielding some imports from the new taxes. based on the possibility of broad tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most outside analyses by banks and think tanks see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnating growth. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress . president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. how will trumps tariffs work? how soon until prices might rise?apr. 2, 2025, 854 p.m. trump has blunt words on possible car price hikes amid new tariffsmar. 31, 2025, 956 a.m. because trump had hyped his tariffs without providing specifics until wednesday, he provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. powered by

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for ~5 paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies[cite: 44]. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for ~5 paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data[cite: 45]. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for ~5 paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data[cite: 46]. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles[cite: 47]. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for ~5 paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data[cite: 49]. Reference specific "Intriguing_angles" frame phrases. Pose cautious, speculative "What if?" questions *grounded* in the previous layers' analysis[cite: 48]. Explore potential hidden motives or unintended consequences *suggested by the evidence*, aligning with the persona's cautious approach[cite: 50].
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for ~5 paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
