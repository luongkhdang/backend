  Title: 'He embraced all people': Californians mourn a pope who shared their values, brought excitement to church
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-21 18:51:44)
  Content: catholics across california mourned the death of pope francis on monday, paying tribute to his modernization of the roman catholic church and steadfast commitment to the poor and marginalized. francis, the first pontiff from latin america, never visited california. but he forged a close bond with the more than 5 million catholics who live in los angeles, largely because he nudged the church to a more tolerant position on social issues by urging compassion for immigrants, arguing for tolerance of gay people and advocating for action on climate change. i have to say what im feeling today is very personal, the archbishop of los angeles, josé h. gomez, told a crowd of nearly 2,000 mourners and tourists who poured into a noon mass at the cathedral of our lady of the angels in downtown los angeles. im going to miss him big time. francis, the catholic churchs 266th leader, made history when he became the first latin american pontiff in 2013. born in 1936 in argentina to italian immigrants, he was also the first pope to take his papal name from st. francis of assisi, a saint who dedicated his life to serving the poor. gomez said francis was like a wise father, a big brother. the fact that he was from a latin american country and the first pope to speak spanish meant a lot to people in that part of the world, including immigrants in l.a. it was very special to us, gomez, who was born in monterrey, mexico, said after the afternoon mass. for us, it was a clear manifestation of the presence of the church in our countries and sense of joy knowing that we are an important part of the life of the church. outside the cathedral, which serves the largest population of catholics in the united states, mourners lay bouquets of red and white roses, white lilies and pink carnations monday morning at the feet of a mosaic of the virgin of guadalupe. inside, cynthia cook and her mother, julieta camacha, offered their silent prayers as cathedral bells rang overhead. i was just in shock, because i thought he was recovering, cook said of francis. the day before, she had watched news reports of francis giving the traditional easter blessing sunday from the balcony of st. peters basilica in the vatican. cook said francis embodied a love for everyone. as the head of the catholic church, he put it out that immigrants are gods children, she said. a tear wells up in the eye of a parishioner maria rodriguez at cathedral of our lady of the angels in downtown los angeles during a noon mass on april 21, 2025. jason armond los angeles times . in riverside, isabel torres prayed to god and asked for his guidance after the end of a packed morning mass at queen of angels catholic church. torres, who works at the church as a cleaner, said she was very sad when she found out about francis death. but at the same time, she said in spanish, i thanked god for the time he gave us with him. a mexican immigrant, torres saw francis as a reflection of god and an example for the way the catholic community should live, primarily through humility. she particularly appreciated how francis urged compassion for migrants. with the help of god almighty, i hope the death of the pope touches the hearts of these presidents, torres said. and that they see us all the same and that they understand we have the right to this world, no matter the race or color. immigrants across southern california valued francis constant emphasis on the right to migrate, said the rev. thomas p. rausch, emeritus professor of catholic theology at loyola marymount university in los angeles. its a fundamental human right, but its not one always appreciated by government, rausch said. after holding mass at queen of angels chapel, the rev. benediktus obon said he hoped the new pontiff would continue the legacy left behind by francis. he was a man of peace, obon said. he loved humanity. he embraced all people, and didnt care who you were. we are all creatures of god. obon acknowledged the role francis played in changing the negative narrative surrounding the catholic church before he took over as pope. his presence in the church brought lots of good things, obon said. he also brought lots of people back to church. for the community, this is a big loss. for obon, it was important that the next pope carries out the criticism of the current u.s. administrations treatment of immigrants that francis carried out until the last day of his life when he met with vice president j.d. vance. see them as human beings first, see them as part of yourself in other people, he said. a parishioner at cathedral of our lady of the angels in downtown los angeles kneels before a portrait of pope francis during a noon mass. jason armond los angeles times just months after assuming the papacy in 2013, francis took his first official trip outside rome to visit the italian island of lampedusa to focus on the plight of migrants and asylum seekers. we have this enormous number of people on the move today, fleeing poverty, injustice, war, violence, and hes shown a real concern for that, rausch said. francis also used his platform to urge tolerance for gay catholics. if a person is gay, and seeks god and has goodwill, who am i to judge? he told a reporter in 2013. in 2022, francis met with former u.s. house speaker nancy pelosi , and she received communion during a papal mass in st. peters basilica, after san francisco archbishop salvatore cordileone barred her from receiving the sacrament in his archdiocese because of her stance on abortion rights. i join the family of god here in the archdiocese of los angeles, and catholics all over the world, in grieving the loss of our holy father, los angeles archbishop josé h. gomez, above, said in a statement. jason armond los angeles times pelosi was one of many political figures across california who paid tribute to francis. in a statement monday, she descirbed him as a beacon of charity, hope and love for all people of faith, he saw god in all his creatures, said gov. gavin newsom, a catholic who met francis last year when he attended a climate summit at the vatican. at the time, newsom was struck by francis praise of californias position on the death penalty. pope francis led with his love of peace and creation and sought to protect and lift up the vulnerable, newsom said in a statement . his papacy was defined by moral courage, a deep respect for all creation, and a profound belief in the power of love to heal and unite. los angeles county supervisor janice hahn, who is not catholic, celebrated francis as a spiritual leader who forged connections with angelenos of all denominations. he reached millions of hearts far beyond the catholic church, she said in a statement, with his words on the greatest challenges facing our world, from war to poverty to climate change to the marginalization of lgbtq people.

  Title: Bucking Trump tariffs, California will push to maintain global trade independently, Newsom says
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-04 14:57:41)
  Content: gov. gavin newsom announced friday that california will look for ways to expand trade and persuade international partners to exempt the state from global payback as president trumps sweeping round of tariffs has sent u.s. and global financial markets tumbling. were not scared to use our market power to fight back against the largest tax hike of our lifetime, newsom posted friday on the social media platform x. in a video , he noted that the 40 million residents of california live in the tent pole of the us economy that represents 14 of the nations gdp. newsom, a democrat who has frequently sparred with trump, said he had directed his administration to look at new opportunities to expand trade and to remind our trading partners around the globe that california remains a stable partner. california is not washington, d.c. newsom told californias international partners in a news release. the golden state will remain a steady, reliable partner for generations to come, no matter the turbulence coming out of washington. california leads the nation in manufacturing and agriculture, and tariffs could adversely affect many sectors of the states economy, from the tech industry to the ports. but its unclear exactly how newsoms efforts to carve out exemptions would work or whether a state can forge such exceptions. a newsom administration official said on background that nations have wide latitude to shape and target retaliatory tariffs. in a news release, the governors office said that it would work to pursue collaborative opportunities with trading partners that protect californias economic interests and the broader supply chains linked to the states economy. the administration, it said, will explore ways to support job creation and innovation in industries reliant on cross-border trade, promote economic stability for businesses and workers impacted by federal trade disruptions and safeguard access to critical supplies, such as construction materials needed for recovery efforts following the devastating los angeles firestorms. kush desai, a white house spokesman, responded by saying, gavin newsom should focus on out-of-control homelessness, crime, regulations, and unaffordability in california, instead of trying his hand at international dealmaking. newsom has no ability to dissuade trump from his tariffs, which would likely mean fewer imports and higher prices for california, said jonathan d. aronson, a professor at usc annenberg who specializes in international trade and communications. but he might be able to persuade some nations not to retaliate against the states industries. california exports a lot of almonds and avocados, a lot of tech and electronics. it might well be something that says, hey, can you not target almonds? can you not target big tech? can you not target these things that we specialize in? aronson said he couldnt think of a precedent for newsoms initiative, which he said was creative. but he noted that it would be a tough message to pitch to china, which provides almost 30 of californias total imports. china cares about only one country, which is china, he said. how much attention would the chinese pay to this? who knows? still, aronson said, even if newsoms pitch is unlikely to move some global payers, it might help if california can persuade some nations that are retaliating to be more targeted. everybody else is not targeting california theyre targeting the united states, and california is getting caught in the wash, aronson said. so, to the extent you can persuade others that were still a good place to deal with and wouldnt you like to come here youve still going to do business with the united states, because were so big if youre going to deal with that, were a reliably sane state. stock markets worldwide plummeted friday after china matched trumps significant raise in tariffs in an escalating trade war. on thursday, the sp 500, dow jones industrial average and nasdaq composite all reached their lowest one-day drops since the economy tanked at the outset of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020. the tariffs hit some of californias top trading partners. trump imposed additional duties of 24 on japan, 25 on south korea and a 34 tariff on china, on top of a 20 tariff applied to that nation over illegal imports of the deadly drug fentanyl. canada and mexico were excluded from both the baseline and reciprocal tariffs, which could ease the effect at the nations grocery stores. most u.s. produce imports come from mexico and canada, including avocados, cucumbers and mushrooms. but the countries still face 25 levies on certain goods and 25 tariffs on imported cars and light trucks. car buyers across south california scrambled this week to make purchases ahead of the tariffs. its going to have a huge, huge impact on manufacturing and supply chains throughout throughout california, economist kevin klowden of the milken institute in santa monica told the times on thursday. we dont have the specialized manufacturing for all of these supply chains, and certainly not at cost in the u.s. trump said the new tariffs represent a turning point globally and for the united states. he dubbed wednesday liberation day, and said it would forever be remembered as the day that american industry was reborn, the day americas destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make america wealthy again. our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not going to happen anymore. its not gonna happen, trump said. this is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in american history. its our declaration of economic independence. over the last decade, california has made concentrated efforts to establish itself nationally and internationally as a beacon of liberal resistance to the administration. during trumps first term, california sued his administration about 120 times over four years, often with success. in the months of trumps current term, california atty. gen. bontas office has joined other states in rekindling that legal fight, challenging the administration on presidential actions on the environment, immigration, voting rights, education policy, dismantling federal agencies and programs and other issues. for years, california leaders have made efforts to establish relationships with foreign leaders and local government officials in other nations, separate from whatever administration occupies the white house. both newsom and former gov. jerry brown entered into agreements with other countries on climate policies, efforts accelerated because of trumps hostility to international environmental cooperation during his first term. after taking office in january, trump withdrew the u.s. from the paris agreement, an international climate accord in which nations worldwide agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to limit global warming. during a trip to the vatican in 2024, newsom met with political leaders in italy to sign a memorandum of understanding on addressing climate change. on a trip to asia last fall, the california governor reached similar agreements with china, the provinces of guangdong and jiangsu, and the municipalities of beijing and shanghai. california also has reached accords with regional governments in canada, mexico, japan, south korea, sweden and norway, among others. since taking office in 2019, newsom also has met personally with former canadian prime minister justin trudeau, chinese president xi jinping and other national leaders. times staff writers michael wilner, laurence darmiento and the associated press contributed to this report.

  Title: 5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday - CNBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-21 12:04:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism in international relations theory posits states as primary actors pursuing self-interest in an anarchic global system. The article text, particularly phrases like 'trumps trade war with china...continues to escalate', 'beijing promised to retaliate', and 'china will resolutely take reciprocal countermeasures', exemplifies this. These snippets reveal a dynamic of escalating tensions and retaliatory threats between major geopolitical actors driven by perceived national interests and power struggles, aligning with realist interpretations of state behavior.; Theories_and_interpretations: Keynesian economics emphasizes the role of aggregate demand and consumer sentiment in economic cycles. The article states 'americans have grown more sour on trumps handling of the economy...as tariffs and efforts to slash federal government spending hit sentiment' and 'more americans now believe the economy will get worse'. This textual evidence suggests a decline in consumer confidence and economic outlook directly linked to government policies (tariffs, spending cuts), supporting a Keynesian interpretation where government actions significantly influence economic sentiment and potentially trigger downturns.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions 'threats to the federal reserves independence after trump hinted at the termination of fed chair jerome powell' without detailing the nature of these 'threats' or the context of Trump's 'hint'. This omission is noteworthy because central bank independence is crucial for economic stability. What specific actions or statements constitute these 'threats', and what are the potential implications for market confidence if central bank autonomy is perceived to be compromised?; Intriguing_angles: The article twice states 'more americans now believe the economy will get worse than at any time since 2023'. This repetition, and the recent year 2023 as a negative benchmark, is unusual. Is this repetition an error, or is it intentional emphasis? Why is 2023 specifically highlighted? Does this reference point to a particular economic shift or policy change around that time that is being implicitly compared to the current situation, thus framing current pessimism as a significant recent decline?

  Content: fox friends co-host brian kilmeade joins fox friends first to discuss vp jd vances meeting with pope francis on easter sunday ahead of his passing at 88 years old. during his tenure as the head of the catholic church, pope francis, who died monday at age 88, spoke about how businesses and the economy should support the poor, while pushing back on suggestions he was anti-capitalist. the vatican announced the death of francis on monday after he recently battled double pneumonia, following a series of health challenges in recent years. francis had recovered enough to participate in easter sunday festivities in rome, where he met with vice president jd vance. vatican officials announced in an update on monday that the pope died of a cerebral stroke. francis, who was born in argentina and named jorge mario bergoglio, was interviewed by argentine journalists francesca ambrogetti and sergio rubin for their 2023 book el pastor, in which he discussed his views on capitalism and the economy, which were profiled in america magazine a catholic magazine published by the american jesuits. i do not condemn capitalism in the way some attribute to me. nor am i against the market economy, the pope said. i am in favor of what john paul ii defined as a social economy of the market. this implies the presence of a regulatory authority, that is the state, which should mediate between the parties. it is a table with three legs the state, capital, and work. pope francis dead at 88, vatican says pope francis died monday at the age of 88 following a recent battle with double pneumonia. kena betancurviewpressgetty images getty images in no part of the bible is there a commandment to produce poverty, francis said. he said that the popular beatitude blessed are the poor in spirit means the person who is not attached to riches. he added that in no way is it bad to produce wealth for the good of all and that to produce it is an act of justice. and for that justice to be complete, it has to be distributive. francis said in the book that governmental support for unemployed workers should be designed in such a way that it does not affect the culture of work, because work gives dignity to people. in remarks last june to managing directors and employees of major companies and banks, francis said that businesses should focus on challenges related to the environment, the poorest and the discarded, as well as young people. the pope urged them to put the environment at the center of their attention and said, we are living in a time of serious environmental crisis that depends on many individuals and factors, among which are the economic and business choices of past and present. it is no longer enough merely to comply with the laws of states, which are proceeding too slowly we need to innovate by anticipating the future, with courageous and forward-looking choices that can be imitated. the innovation of the entrepreneur nowadays must first and foremost be innovation in caring for our common home, francis said. what american catholics thought about pope francis the new york stock exchange honored the life of pope francis with a minute of silence on monday. michael m. santiagogetty images getty images he also urged them to not forget the poorest and the discarded, saying a circular economy has become a key term, calling for reusing and recycling waste. yet while we recycle materials and their waste, we have not yet learned allow me to use the expression to recycle and not discard people and workers, especially the most vulnerable, to whom the culture of waste often applies. it is important that you be wary of a certain meritocracy that is used to legitimize the exclusion of the poor, who are judged as undeserving, even to the point of viewing poverty itself as their fault, the pope added. the challenge is to include the poor in businesses, to make them resources for the benefit of all. this is possible. i dream of a world in which the discarded can become the protagonists of change, yet it seems to me that jesus has already accomplished that, dont you think? francis remarks also encouraged businesses to extend opportunities to young people, who he said are often among the poor of our time poor in resources, opportunities and a future. paradoxically, this occurs both where there are many of them, yet lacking in means, and where there are fewer and fewer of them such as in italy, because children are not being born here yet with available means. pope francis led the catholic church for 12 years. riccardo de lucaanadolu via getty images getty images 5 ways pope francis impacted the catholic church we do not learn any job without corporate hospitality, which means generously welcoming young people when they lack the required experience and skills, for every job is learned only by doing it, the pope said. i encourage you, then, to be generous, to welcome young people into your businesses, giving them a glimpse of the future so that an entire generation does not lose hope. in remarks to italian family businesses in october 2024, francis said, the church is the family of god, and looks kindly on everything that is family. first individuals and then the family no! first the family and, within the family, the people. in your case, you are characterized by the delicate balance between family and work, which is expressed in entrepreneurial courage and responsibility. it is good, it is constructive when courage and responsibility go together, he said. bishop barron reacts to death of pope francis, praises papacy marked by mercy and evangelization pope francis advocated for businesses to expand opportunities for the poor and the young, while also urging a focus on environmental issues. alberto pizzoliafp via getty images getty images like the mission of the church, your activity is generally rooted in a territory, which you are called upon to enrich, both with the witness of family bonds and the seriousness of your professional commitment, he said. may the gift of faith increasingly guide your presence in local realities, and strengthen your participation in the fortunes of humanity. let us not forget that everything is connected, nothing is isolated. francis said that the family businesses should keep going, to feel that you are part, in the church, of a larger family and a great undertaking, which is service to the kingdom of god and to its justice. get fox business on the go by clicking here i therefore invite you to enlarge your heart and broaden your outlook, to nurture listening, at home and in business, between different generations this is important, listening between different generations grandparents with grandchildren, this is very important, the pope said. believe in the vocation of your children whatever it may be and open doors and windows to those who wish to travel a stretch of the road with you. let us remember the parable of the talents none of what has been entrusted to you should be buried! do not be afraid, and keep going with confidence, francis said. get a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus ceo interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you. weve added you to our mailing list. by clicking subscribe, you agree to the fox news and terms of use, and agree to receive content and promotional communications from fox news. you understand that you can opt-out at any time.

  Title: Stock market rallies after closed-door remarks by Treasury Secretary Bessent - Fortune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 20:15:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The recurring mentions of 'Trump tariffs' and 'Trump policy changes' alongside discussions of corporate hits (RTX), market reactions ('volatility spike', 'markets open sharply higher'), and geopolitical shifts ('softens on china', 'china de-escalation') align with aspects of Political Economy theory. This perspective suggests that political decisions and the actions of key political figures (like Trump) are not merely isolated events but have direct, measurable consequences on economic actors (companies like RTX, markets) and international economic relations (China trade). The text provides evidence of this linkage by explicitly connecting policy actions (tariffs, changes) to economic outcomes (hits, market shifts).; Theories_and_interpretations: The juxtaposition of headlines about market reactions to political statements ('investors are finally taking trump seriously', 'markets open sharply higher after trump softens') and the mention of 'agenda-setting' in the context of financial news (implied by the focus on specific topics like tariffs, Fed Chair, China) could be viewed through the lens of Agenda-Setting Theory. While typically applied to media influence on public perception, here it highlights how the *focus* of political figures (Trump's statements on China, Powell) can directly influence the *agenda* of financial markets and news coverage, demonstrating the power of political rhetoric to shape economic attention and action, as evidenced by the immediate market response described.; Intriguing_angles: The text mentions 'doges staffing cuts' as a cause for the IRS's 'nightmare' tax season and potential refund delays. The term 'doges' is unusual in this context and lacks clear identification as a standard entity type (Organization, Government Agency). Its significance lies in being presented as a direct causal factor for a major government agency's operational failure, yet its nature remains undefined within the article. What entity or concept does 'doges' represent in this context, and why is it presented as a singular, impactful cause without further clarification?

  Title: Arellano: Archbishop Gomez, you still have time. Follow Pope Francis' example
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-23 10:00:59)
  Content: mourners attend a mass presided over by archbishop jose h. gomez at the cathedral of our lady of the angels following the death of pope francis. los angeles archbishop josé h. gomez and the late pope francis assumed their positions two years apart. both were pioneering latinos gomez became the first mexican-born head of the largest u.s. archdiocese in 2011, and francis became the first pontiff from the americas in 2013. both inherited messes left by their predecessors gomez needed to right his l.a. see after decades of sex abuse scandals under cardinal roger mahony, and francis had to figure out how to rule in the shadow of benedict xvi, the first pope to resign in nearly 600 years. each came from religious movements long controversial in the catholic world the progressive jesuits for francis, the conservative opus dei for gomez. they both earned plaudits for doing the hard work of ministering from blue-collar cities buenos aires for francis, san antonio for gomez. thats why catholics worldwide warmly welcomed them and crowned them with the expectation to make history. after his death the day after easter at age 88, francis was hailed for pushing catholics and others to forsake egotism and materialism in favor of a kinder, more tolerant world focused above all on the marginalized. the man born jorge mario bergoglio oversaw a church that grew from 1.3 billion catholics when he started to 1.4 billion today, according to vatican figures. his reign was not perfect, and his liberal creed antagonized enough conservative catholics that a counter-movement has emerged in the u.s., complete with its own conferences, private schools and publications. history will nevertheless remember francis as a pope of consequence, who met the proverbial moment in a way that would make st. peter proud. in a statement after francis death, archbishop gomez prayed for catholics to remember the popes call to urgent tasks that are still not finished, such as standing with societys downtrodden, evangelizing and creating a peaceful world. its a nice sentiment, and i hope gomez really takes it to heart. in an area that used to produce influential catholic churchmen the way the dodgers churned out rookies of the year, gomez has amounted to the living equivalent of a hair shirt a mode of piety that serves no one but the wearer. los angeles has changed mightily since gomez started here 14 years ago. the poor have gotten poorer, and the rich have retreated to their camera-protected homes. corruption has infected the body politic, leaving a chasm in local leadership desperate for someone to fill. in the last five years, angelenos have weathered covid, the city hall audio leak scandal, the palisades and eaton fires, and now the specter of tariffs and immigration raids devastating a global city. yet gomez has largely urged his flock to lead contemplative lives in the name of jesus, mary and the saints, which pales to the witness practiced not just by francis but by many in the l.a. archdiocese itself. a photograph of auxiliary bishop david g. oconnell is set near the entrance of the cathedral of our lady of the angels in 2023. oconnell was gunned down at his home in hacienda heights. francine orr los angeles times here is where father luis olivares defied church and government officials to make la placita church a sanctuary for central american refugees during the 1980s. where father gregory boyle created homeboy industries to bring dignity and meaning to the lives of former gang members. where since the 1980s, father john moretta has counseled parishioners at resurrection church in boyle heights on the troubles that afflict their neighborhood. where one of gomezs own auxiliary bishops, the late david oconnell, fought environmental racism on behalf of black parishioners in south l.a., stood with striking hotel workers and prayed with parishioners outside planned parenthood clinics. where members of the catholic worker serve free meals on skid row. when i think of those examples and so many more, i think of pope francis. i dont think of gomez and thats a shame. there was a time when the archbishop seemed as if he would work in that realm of the beatitudes. in 2013, he released a book titled immigration and the next america that advocated for comprehensive immigration reform and the worth of all people coming into this country. as recently as 2020, the cathedral of our lady of the angels rang its bells in memory of george floyd, while gomez used his regular letter to angelenos to decry racism as a blasphemy against god and urged everyone to root out the racial injustice that still infects too many areas of american society. but as l.a. became more progressive, gomez retreated into his conservatism. during his three years as the first latino head of the u.s. conference of catholic bishops, gomez pursued culture war nonsense instead of actual issues. when joe biden, a liberal and a lifelong catholic, was inaugurated president , the archbishop penned a letter accusing him of planning to advance moral evils like gay marriage, abortion rights and employer-funded contraception. that same year, gomez traveled to spain to deliver a speech trashing woke culture. two years later, when the dodgers honored for its charitable work a drag troupe that dresses in nuns habits, gomez held what he described as a mass of healing that amounted to an attempted exorcism on behalf of the whole city. of all the reasons gomez could have held a commemorative service in the city of angels, this was it? as the college of cardinals meets at the vatican in the coming weeks to elect francis successor, gomez, a mere archbishop, will stay home. he has about two more years before he has to send the next pope the letter of resignation required of all bishops and cardinals when they turn 75. to archbishop gomez, i say repent of your underwhelming tenure. find inspiration from the passing of papá francisco. give l.a. the succor it needs, while you still have time.

  Title: Vatican Notes 'Exchange of Opinions' Over Migrants, Prisoners in Meeting With Vance
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-19 05:10:09)
  Content: vatican city ap u.s. vice president jd vance met saturday with the vaticans no. 2 official amid tensions over the u.s. crackdown on migrants, with the holy see reaffirming good relations but noting an exchange of opinions over current international conflicts, migrants and prisoners. vance, a catholic convert, met with the secretary of state, cardinal pietro parolin, and the foreign minister, archbishop paul gallagher, in the apostolic palace. there was no indication he met with pope francis, who has sharply cut back official duties during his recovery from pneumonia. vances office said he and parolin discussed their shared religious faith, catholicism in the united states, the plight of persecuted christian communities around the world, and president trumps commitment to restoring world peace. the holy see has responded cautiously to the trump administration while seeking to continue productive relations in keeping with its tradition of diplomatic neutrality. it has expressed alarm over the administrations crackdown on migrants and cuts in international aid while insisting on peaceful resolutions to the wars in ukraine and gaza. those concerns were reflected in the vatican statement, which said the talks were cordial and that the vatican expressed satisfaction with the administrations commitment to protecting freedom of religion and conscience. there was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners, the statement said. finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the state and the catholic church in the united states, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged. the reference to serene collaboration appeared to refer to vances assertion that the u.s. conference of catholic bishops was resettling illegal immigrants in order to get federal funding. top u.s. cardinals have pushed back strongly against the claim. it is clear that the approach of the current u.s. administration is very different from what we are used to and, especially in the west, from what we have relied on for many years, parolin told la repubblica daily on the eve of vances visit. as the u.s. pushes to end the war in ukraine, parolin reaffirmed kyivs right to its territorial integrity and insisted that any peace deal must not be imposed on ukraine but is built patiently, day by day, with dialogue and mutual respect. vance was spending easter weekend in rome with his family and attended good friday services in st. peters basilica after meeting with italian premier giorgia meloni. on saturday, after introducing his family to parolin, the vances got a private tour of the sistine chapel and later visited romes botanic garden, where one of his sons was seen in a plastic gladiator costume that is popular among italian kids. it wasnt immediately clear where they would celebrate easter. francis, for his part, indicated he hoped to attend easter mass that usually draws thousands to st. peters square, according to the official mass booklet and liturgical plans released saturday. papal rebuke on migration, appeal for prisoners francis and vance have tangled sharply over migration and the trump administrations plans to deport migrants en masse. francis has made caring for migrants a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative u.s. catholic church. francis also changed church teaching to say that capital punishment is inadmissible in all cases. after a public appeal from francis just weeks before trump took office, president joe biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row. trump is an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment. vance, who converted to catholicism in 2019, identifies with a small catholic intellectual movement, viewed by some critics as having reactionary or authoritarian leanings, that is often called postliberal. postliberals share some longstanding catholic conservative views, such as opposition to abortion and lgbtq rights. they envision a counterrevolution in which they take over government bureaucracy and institutions like universities from within, replacing entrenched elites with their own and acting upon their vision of the common good. just days before he was hospitalized in february, francis blasted the trump administrations deportation plans, warning that they would deprive migrants of their inherent dignity. in a letter to u.s. bishops, francis also appeared to respond to vance directly for having claimed that catholic doctrine justified such policies. a latin concept of love vance had defended the administrations america-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval catholic theology known in latin as ordo amoris. he has said the concept delineates a hierarchy of care to family first, followed by neighbor, community, fellow citizens and lastly those elsewhere. in his feb. 10 letter, francis appeared to correct vances understanding of the concept. christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups, he wrote. the true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the good samaritan, that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception. vance has acknowledged francis criticism but has said he would continue to defend his views. during a feb. 28 appearance at the national catholic prayer breakfast in washington, vance didnt address the issue specifically but called himself a baby catholic and acknowledged there are things about the faith that i dont know. while he had criticized francis on social media in the past, vance recently has posted prayers for francis recovery. ___ this version corrects the first name of gallagher. ___ associated press religion coverage receives support through the aps collaboration with the

  Title: Pope Francis Dies After Easter Plea to End War in Gaza - Truthout
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-21 14:27:54)
  Content: in his final public message, pope francis decried the terrible conflict in gaza. the vatican announced monday that pope francis has died at the age of 88, hours after he appeared at an easter mass and appealed for an end to israels war on the gaza strip. the popes easter address, read aloud by archbishop diego ravelli, decried the terrible conflict in gaza that continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation. i appeal to the warring parties call a cease-fire, release the hostages, and come to the aid of a starving people that aspires to a future of peace! said the message from the pope, an outspoken opponent of military conflict and war profiteers, climate destruction, and runaway economic inequality. in the face of the cruelty of conflicts that involve defenceless civilians and attack schools, hospitals, and humanitarian workers, we cannot allow ourselves to forget that it is not targets that are struck, but persons, each possessed of a soul and human dignity, the popes address continued. news of pope francis death came after a bout with double pneumonia left him hospitalized for more than a month. the vatican did not specify a cause of death in its announcement. the nations john nichols wrote sunday that pope francis calls for peace have made him arguably the most consistent high-profile defender of the humanity of the palestinian people during a period when the israeli assault on gaza has been pursued with relentless violence. with a boldness and specificity that has often sparked controversy, this pope has challenged economic injustice, racism, environmental neglect, militarism, and the abuses of new technologies that increase inequality. he has faced his share of criticism, not just from conservatives who disapprove of his views but also from reformers who sincerely wish that he would do more to modernize the church. yet, in a time of too much indifference and impunity, this pope has remained uniquely engaged with the embattled regions that political and media elites neglect or abandon. thats been especially true when it comes to gaza, where pope francis has long argued for cease-fires, arms blockades, aid convoys, and a diplomatic urgency that recognizes that palestinians and israelis are fraternal peoples who have the right to live in peace. in a tribute to pope francis, palestinian theologian munther isaac wrote monday that he conveyed true compassion to palestinians, most notably to those in gaza during this genocide. the pope left our world today, and the occupation and the wall remained. even worse, he left our world while a genocide continues to unfold, isaac wrote, pointing to the pontiffs call for a thorough international investigation of israels assault on gaza. today i wonder will the millions who will mourn his death these coming days respect this wish of his? isaac asked. will they care for gazans and palestinians the way he did? weve borne witness to a chaotic first few months in trumps presidency. over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. but, as organizer sandra avalos implored us to remember in truthout last november, together, we are more powerful than trump. indeed, the trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but as weve reported at truthout many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and dei programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. and communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ice raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity. it will be a long fight ahead. and as nonprofit movement media, truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance. as we undertake this life-sustaining work, we appeal for your support. we have 2 days left in our fundraiser please, if you find value in what we do, join our community of sustainers by making a monthly or one-time gift.

Historical Article 19 (ID: 130873):
  Title: Pope Francis was a globalist in an age of nationalists
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-22 14:10:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article's consistent focus on the ideological conflict between 'globalism' (represented by Francis) and 'nationalism' (represented by Trump, Vance, and others) suggests this framing is central to how the information is presented. Phrases like 'the anti-globalist mission is at the heart of president donald trumps second term' and 'contempt for the globalist agenda also shaped right-wing criticism of pope francis' highlight this divide, making it a primary lens for the reader to interpret the various events and statements discussed. This emphasis shapes the perceived importance of this ideological struggle in contemporary affairs.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article implicitly contrasts a Realist approach to state action with a more universalist perspective. Trump's actions, such as withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and gutting aid, are explicitly linked to 'narrow national self-interest'. This aligns with Political Realism, where states prioritize their own perceived gains above international cooperation or moral appeals. Francis's calls for 'globalization of solidarity' and prioritizing the 'common good' stand in direct opposition, highlighting the tension between state-centric self-interest and a cosmopolitan view of global responsibility as presented in the text.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Francis's apology for 16th-century atrocities by Spanish conquistadors and the Vox party spokesperson's reaction questioning an 'argentine nationality' pope apologizing for 'others'. Textual Basis: 'The pontiffs decision in 2021 to apologize for the 16th century atrocities carried out in the new world by spanish conquistadors in the name of the catholic church provoked anger in spain, with a spokesperson for the far-right vox party scoffing i do not understand how a pope of argentine nationality can apologize on behalf of others.' Significance: This detail, seemingly historical, is used to illustrate contemporary political framing. The reaction highlights how national identity and historical events are interpreted and potentially weaponized within current political debates, particularly against figures perceived as 'globalist'. Probing Questions: How does the article's inclusion of this historical event and reaction serve to reinforce the contemporary political conflicts it describes? What does the emphasis on Francis's 'argentine nationality' in the Vox quote suggest about the underlying tensions being highlighted?; Intriguing_angles: The text notes JD Vance's use of the concept 'ordo amoris' to frame his nativism and states that Francis 'had little time for such arguments'. Textual Basis: 'in the early weeks of this trump presidency, vance attempted to frame his nativism in medieval catholic terms, citing the concept of ordo amoris... Up to his last days, francis had little time for such arguments.' Significance: This specific interaction reveals a struggle over the interpretation and application of traditional religious/philosophical concepts in modern political discourse. Vance attempts to legitimize a political stance (nativism) through selective appeal to tradition, while the religious authority figure (Francis) dismisses this application, suggesting a deeper conflict over defining values. Probing Questions: What does Vance's attempt to use 'ordo amoris' reveal about the strategies employed to bridge religious identity and political ideology? How does Francis's reported reaction challenge or validate the use of religious concepts in political arguments as presented here?

  Content: youre reading an excerpt from the worldview newsletter. sign up to get the rest, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox on mondays, wednesdays and fridays. the term globalist is mostly invoked in the pejorative. the wests right-wing nationalists, in particular, have for years laid the failures and ills of their societies at the feet of globalists conjuring a caricature of well-heeled, jet-setting elites who pursue multinational capital and cosmopolitan schemes supposedly at the expense of their countrymen. the anti-globalist mission is at the heart of president donald trumps second term it looms over the administrations moves to deport undocumented migrants and foreign students, and animates trumps protectionist zeal as he tries to reconfigure the global economic order through sweeping tariffs. contempt for the globalist agenda also shaped right-wing criticism of pope francis, the venerable argentine jesuit cleric who died monday after suffering a stroke and cardiocirculatory collapse. his support for the rights of migrants, activism over climate change and qualified acceptance of homosexuality saw u.s. right-wingers cast francis as a woke pope, sympathetic to the liberation theology of the americas reviled by vatican traditionalists and western conservatives. erstwhile trump adviser stephen k. bannon once told far-right counterparts in europe to view the pontiff as the enemy. the lepanto institute, an ultraconservative catholic think tank that raged against the francis pontificate, frequently insisted the pope was doing the work of communists. the pontiffs decision in 2021 to apologize for the 16th century atrocities carried out in the new world by spanish conquistadors in the name of the catholic church provoked anger in spain, with a spokesperson for the far-right vox party scoffing i do not understand how a pope of argentine nationality can apologize on behalf of others. francis was not spared the ire of fellow argentines, either, as ultralibertarian argentine president javier milei declared in an interview before taking office that the pope was a representative of the evil left. milei has since been more conciliatory, and waved away at their minor differences in a statement mourning the death of francis. leaders around the globe offered condolences for the loss of pope francis on april 21. video reuters its a small irony that one of pope franciss last major meetings was with vice president jd vance, a convert to catholicism who has since styled himself as a postliberal nationalist, in a nod to a particular tradition of reactionary catholic thinking. in the early weeks of this trump presidency, vance attempted to frame his nativism in medieval catholic terms, citing the concept of ordo amoris, or order of love or charity, that suggested one had a greater obligation to those closer to you than farther away. up to his last days, francis had little time for such arguments. the act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness, he wrote in a recent letter to u.s. bishops. in trumps first term, francis suggested the white houses building of border walls and separation of asylum-seeking parents from their children made the president not christian. the popes easter address delivered this weekend by a surrogate bemoaned the hatreds of any increasingly illiberal age. how much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalized and migrants, the text said. i appeal to all those in positions of political responsibility in our world not to yield to the logic of fear. francis spent years doggedly trying to counter this fear of the stranger. he washed the feet of arab migrants seeking asylum in europe. he begged forgiveness of rohingya muslims in a public ceremony after critics accused him of not doing enough to champion their plight during a 2017 visit to myanmar, whose authorities treat the persecuted minority as stateless interlopers. and he broke with papal precedent to argue in 2023 against secular antigay laws and said being homosexual is not a crime. his was the image of the good samaritan, and through him, the image he gave of the church was of a good samaritan, marco politi, a papal biographer and longtime vatican watcher, told my colleagues. selecting a new pope is a centuries-old process involving rounds of secretive voting, speeches, prayers and a dose of political maneuvering. video sarah hashemi, joe snellthe washington post francis saw himself as a globalist, but not in the terms laid out by those who revile globalism. in an address last year to the world economic forum that bastion of globalists he said the process of globalization had made clear the interdependence of the worlds nations and peoples and therefore carried a fundamentally moral dimension. he called on states and businesses to promote far-sighted and ethically sound models of globalization and to subordinate the pursuit of power and individual gain in the cause of a greater common good. in 2018, he urged the globalization of solidarity, appealing for support for the poor and those stranded in warzones or mired in humanitarian disasters. such entreaties have often gone unheeded and seem wholly at odds with the worldview of the white house, where trump has invoked narrow national self-interest to justify the gutting of u.s. humanitarian aid to the rest of word and the slashing of environmental regulations and pledges. in 2017, francis gifted trump a copy of his 192-page encyclical on ecology that noted the solid scientific consensus about human-driven climate change and called for dramatic action to reduce carbon-based emissions. the u.s. president never much of a reader didnt seem to take the message to heart, as he later pulled the united states out of the paris climate agreement. francis was elected by conclave in 2013, after many countries that were home to the planets 1.4 billion catholics had lurched out of the global financial crisis. but the ensuing years have seen waves of crises and instability. international diplomacy failed to stop hideous wars across the globe, including in ukraine and gaza where francis has long called for a lasting ceasefire. an epochal pandemic convulsed the world. in western democracies, economic inequality expanded, the liberal establishment kept crumbling and angry right-wing populism came to the fore. its unclear which cardinal will follow francis, but theres a possibility an ultraconservative backlash could yield a more doctrinaire successor. such a figure would be less adversarial with trump and vance, but would remind others of what has been lost in this popes passing.
