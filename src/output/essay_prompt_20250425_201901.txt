  Title: Sea lions, dolphins, now a whale: Ocean giant is latest victim of SoCal's toxic algal bloom
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:22:18)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article focuses heavily on domoic acid poisoning and its effects on marine life, potentially influencing public perception of environmental threats. The repeated mentions of "domoic acid" and its impact on "marine mammals" serve to highlight this specific issue, potentially overshadowing other environmental concerns. This could lead to increased public attention and policy focus on algal blooms and their toxins, while other ecological problems receive less attention.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions "runoff from the recent fires in palisades as contributors to the algae bloom" but doesn't elaborate on the specific mechanisms or the relative contribution compared to other factors like climate change or upwelling. This omission is intriguing because it could downplay the role of human activities (e.g., land management practices that exacerbate fire risk) in contributing to the algal bloom. What is the relative contribution of fire runoff compared to other factors, and why isn't this quantified or discussed in more detail?
  Key Entities Mentioned:

  Content: a minke whale that was swimming in long beach harbor earlier this month died from domoic acid poisoning associated with a toxic algal bloom that has stricken many other sea creatures, according to officials. michael milstein, spokesperson for the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations west coast regional office, said test results showed the whale had high levels of domoic acid in its urine at the time of its death. this is consistent with the many other marine mammals we have seen affected by domoic acid produced by the harmful algal bloom off southern california first detected in february, milstein said in a statement. the tests are taking longer since the lab is processing so many. domoic acid is a neurotoxin produced by harmful algal blooms that accumulates in filter-feeding fish including anchovies and sardines which are then eaten by seals, sea lions and dolphins. this is the fourth consecutive year there has been a domoic acid event, but this years started much earlier than previous ones, according to milstein. the algae bloom was the result of an upswell in the ocean that brought up enough nutrients to the surface to allow the algae to thrive, he said. other experts also point to climate change and the runoff from the recent fires in palisades as contributors to the algae bloom. hundreds of sea lions and dolphins have been affected so far, milstein said. this has probably been the most severe, particularly this early in the year, he said. how long it continues is the question. the 24-foot-long minke whale was swimming in the harbor for several days and officials had tried to push it out to sea, only for it to come back, milstein said. the whale, which is male, was then found dead april 3. minke whales are considered the smallest of the great, or baleen, whale family, and can grow to more than 26 feet long and weigh as much as 14,000 pounds, according to noaa . there are about 900 minke whales off the coasts of oregon, washington and california. theyre protected under the marine mammal protection act. last week, a dead gray whale was also found washed ashore on huntington beach. the pacific marine mammal center in laguna beach is performing a necropsy to determine the animals cause of death. although most of the marine mammals affected by domoic acid toxicity are california sea lions, other animals are also susceptible to its effects, according to the marine mammal center. domoic acid has been found in blue and humpback whales, as well as guadalupe fur seals, which is a threatened species. ingesting domoic acid from harmful algal blooms can cause sea lions and other animals to have seizures or to crane their heads in a motion known as stargazing. they can also fall into a comatose state. experts advise people not to interact with animals believed to be sick because they might aggressively lunge or even bite. milstein said its unlikely that the domoic acid event will have a significant effect on the overall population of marine mammals off the western coast. theres a silver lining to the incredible productivity of the california ecosystem, he said. on one hand it is feeding the algae bloom, but its also responsible for the incredible diversity of species were fortunate to have off the west coast. these species are pretty strong and resilient and they have shown that over the year.

  Title: Reams of documents related to L.A. County sex abuse cases never turned over, lawyers say
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:11:23)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article illustrates aspects of the Principal-Agent Problem within the context of public institutions. The county (the principal, representing the public interest) delegates authority to its probation staff (the agents). The text highlights alleged failures of the agents (abuse) and a potential failure of the principal (the county) to adequately oversee, document, and respond to these actions over decades, as evidenced by the discovery dispute and the large settlement payout. This suggests a breakdown in the mechanisms designed to ensure agents act in the best interest of the principal and those they serve.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative around AB 218 and subsequent legislative proposals (like SB 577) reflects elements of Agenda-Setting Theory. The large volume of lawsuits enabled by AB 218 (an event/policy) has forced the issue of institutional liability and financial burden onto the legislative agenda, prompting lawmakers to propose new bills aimed at managing the fallout. The framing by Senator Laird about 'restoring equilibrium' suggests an attempt to shape the public and legislative perception of the problem and the proposed solution.
  Key Entities Mentioned:

  Content: thousands of documents that could contain key details about rampant childhood sexual abuse inside a defunct santa clarita detention camp including so-called grooming drawings were left scattered inside the facility and never turned over to the victims attorneys, according to a firm suing l.a. county over the decades-old incidents. as part of the preparation for a looming june trial, attorneys with law firm manly, stewart finaldi had arranged april 15 to visit camp scott, a shuttered l.a. county probation camp where many of their clients say they were sexually abused as children. inside the facility were reams of records that the county should have turned over to the firm more than a year ago through discovery, said attorney courtney thom, whose firm has about 150 civil cases alleging sexual abuse by county probation staff. you can understand my shock when im walking through where my clients got raped as children, and there are documents everywhere, thom said at a monday superior court hearing in downtown los angeles. thom said she discovered thousands of paper grievances, a locked file cabinet labeled personnel files camps a w, and a drawing she believed was signed by thomas jackson a probation deputy accused by at least 20 women of sexually assaulting them at the camp. the drawing, included in a court filing, was of the name tami in big, block orange letters and appeared to be signed by a jackson. t. attorney james sargent, who is representing the county and accompanied thom for the tour last week, called her claims inflammatory and incorrect. they want to air what they deem as dirty laundry, said sargent, who told l.a. superior court judge lawrence riff that the personnel files they discovered had nothing to do with the staff named in the lawsuits. nor did the drawing, he said. tami wilson, a former supervisor at the camp, told him she recalled being given the hand-drawn card by a youth, he wrote in a court filing. the county announced earlier this month they planned to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of alleged sexual abuse inside the countys juvenile facilities and foster homes. the settlement believed to be the largest sex abuse settlement in u.s. history arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to file civil suits against alleged predators and the agencies that employed them. a handful of prominent firms including manly, stewart finaldi declined to participate in the settlement and have ongoing litigation. in the aftermath of ab 218, state legislators have introduced several bills to attempt to make it easier for governments and school districts to deal with the financial fallout from the deluge of suits. one of these bills sb 577 is set for a hearing tuesday. the bills author, state sen. john laird, said the legislation is intended to restore some equilibrium, lessening the financial blow to public agencies while still upholding a victims right to sue. county lawyers claim one reason the state law change has had such a devastating financial toll is because many of the records they need to fight decades-old cases are long gone. attorney john manly argued the claim flew in the face of what his firm saw at camp scott. the county has been telling all of sacramento that they dont have any documents, said manly, who urged the judge to allow his firm to publicize the footage theyd taken of the heaps of documents. we need to be able to share this with legislators. riff agreed with the countys request that the videos from inside camp scott remain confidential for now due to security risks, though he instructed both sides to try to find some common ground on whether certain videos could be made public. though camp scott hasnt been used to house youths for years, sargent wrote in a filing that may soon change. l.a. county superior court judge miguel espinoza ordered the county friday to prepare to shut down los padrinos juvenile hall the countys last remaining juvenile hall, where roughly 270 youths are held due to problems stemming from chronic understaffing. the youth presently in los padrinos will need to go somewhere, and if some wind up at camp scott, the public release of photos and videos could be seriously detrimental, sargent wrote. thom noted that both reporters and television crews have been allowed to broadcast footage taken inside the camp, including a 2001 documentary, camp scott lock-up. the l.a. times has been in there to photograph, said thom. mtv videoed more than we did.

  Title: State orders Chiquita Canyon Landfill to take corrective measures or face fines
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-04 10:00:11)
  Content: a smoldering chemical reaction brewing deep inside the recently closed chiquita canyon landfill in castaic now threatens to consume an entire 160-acre canyon of buried waste, endangering a storage area for hazardous liquid waste, according to state officials. the california environmental protection agency and state department of toxic substances control say the situation poses an imminent and substantial danger to public health and the environment, and ordered the company to take corrective measures or face fines of up to 70,000 daily. the scorching-hot chemical reaction has been burning garbage deep underground in a 30-acre portion of chiquita canyon landfill for nearly three years, causing noxious odors to drift into nearby neighborhoods and hazardous leachate to spill onto the surface. although the landfill representatives have insisted the chemical reaction had largely been contained to that 30-acre area, california environmental regulators say theres evidence that it has expanded to about 90 acres, citing abnormally high temperatures and carbon monoxide emissions in new areas, according to a new state analysis and enforcement action. without further action, state officials expect the reaction to continue to grow and burn trash for a decade or more. there is no proposed barrier to prevent the reaction from consuming the entire facility, a march 28 calrecycle report reads. the reaction area is expanding, and the current containment strategy has failed. waste connections inc., the landfill owner and operator, disputed the states findings. the company disagrees with a number of statements and allegations made by some of its regulators and the conclusions they are drawing from the data, steve cassulo, the landfill manager, said in a statement. our staff believes the data show that the mitigation efforts undertaken to date have had positive results to the stated goal of slowing the reaction. climate environment california regulators want to weaken hazardous waste disposal rules california environmental regulators are considering rolling back the states hazardous waste disposal rules, potentially permitting some municipal landfills to accept more contaminated soil from heavily polluted areas. according to state officials, some parts of the landfill are rapidly collapsing as large amounts of buried waste are burnt or break down. this includes an area underneath one of the landfills tank farms a collection of storage containers used to store and treat hazardous leachate. deep cracks and sinkholes have also formed on the landfills surface near these leachate storage containers. state regulators worry that damage to the tank farm would cause chemical-laden leachate to spill onto the landfills surface and potentially into nearby sources of water. state agencies have ordered waste connections to relocate the tank farm to prevent hazardous chemicals from seeping into groundwater or spilling into storm drains that feed into the santa clara river. the leachate spills also pose a threat to local air quality. when the scalding-hot leachate spills onto the surface, some of the toxic chemicals can evaporate, including benzene a cancer-causing chemical found in cigarette smoke. some leachate samples contained benzene levels so high that they were considered hazardous waste under federal standards. residents have phoned in thousands of odor complaints to the south coast air quality management district. many say they have experienced headaches, nosebleeds and difficulty breathing. state assemblymember pilar schiavo d-chatsworth, who represents the neighboring communities of val verde and castaic, petitioned for the state to declare a state of emergency, underscoring the serious and long-lasting health risks from exposure. the newsom administration denied the request, saying an emergency proclamation would not assist response efforts. the tanks where theyre treating the toxic liquid, the ground is becoming unstable, schiavo said. thats just an absolute nightmare situation. the leachate has so many horrific chemicals that will make people sick. and unfortunately, you know, i havent heard of a solution. theres no silver bullet for this kind of situation. how this is not one of the biggest disasters that we are all talking about boggles my mind, schiavo added. in the past, the extreme heat from the reaction area has caused pressure to build up. toxic leachate occasionally erupted and spilled onto the landfills surface. as a result, the landfill has been proactively extracting leachate to alleviate the pressure. last year, nearly 63 million gallons of leachate were collected. in addition to relocating the tank farm, state regulators are also requiring waste connections to install a barrier to prevent the chemical reaction from moving farther south. if the reaction spreads there, the heat and instability could trigger a landslide, potentially blocking the main entrance to the landfill. the state also is requiring the landfill to expand its synthetic cover system across the entire main canyon to help suppress fumes. enough is enough, director katie butler of the department of toxic substances control said in a statement. for too long, residents in val verde and castaic have suffered as this environmental crisis worsens. and the landfills strategy is not working. this order requires tangible actions to contain the reaction and reduce impacts. dtsc will enforce it to the fullest extent the law allows.

  Title: California, other states sue Trump administration over cuts to CDC infectious disease funding
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-01 17:27:50)
  Content: a health worker dons personal protective equipment before entering the room of a patient with covid-19 in the icu of ventura county medical center in september 2021. california and a coalition of other states sued the trump administration tuesday over its plans to cut billions of dollars in federal public health grants designed to make states more resilient to infectious disease, and accused the administration of overreaching its authority by clawing back funding already allocated by congress. the pullback in funding is a devastating hit to local health departments, many of whom are dealing with large and novel outbreaks ranging from covid-19 to bird flu and measles. agencies in california alone stand to lose nearly 1 billion. congress explicitly authorized funding for the grants at issue to help keep our country healthy and protect us from future pandemics, california atty. gen. rob bonta said, and health and human services secretary robert f. kennedy jr. cannot unilaterally do away with that critical federal funding. the centers for disease control and prevention last month notified health agencies in all 50 states including the california department of public health that it was suspending more than 11 billion in grants it had previously provided to support state infectious disease responses during the covid-19 pandemic. since the pandemic has subsided, the states have continued using the funding for a range of infectious disease initiatives. the lawsuit, filed against kennedy and the health and human services department in federal court in rhode island by california, 23 other states and the district of columbia, is the latest in a string of litigation filed by democratic-led states against the administration amid a wave of policy enactments and other funding cuts that trump has attempted to initiate through executive orders and other white house dictates since taking office in january. several of the states prior lawsuits have also alleged that trump is illegally seizing funding powers that belong to congress, and not to the executive branch. tuesdays lawsuit alleges the trump administration is in violation of the administrative procedure act, and seeks a temporary restraining order that would immediately restore the public health funding to its previously allocated levels. bontas office said the cuts which include 972 million in funds for california would cause irreparable harm to the states if allowed to stand. it said the california department of public health would lose 800 million that it planned to use in part to vaccinate 4.5 million children and improve logistical preparation for directing sick and injured patients from hospitals to other available health facilities during emergencies. the office said the california department of health care services would lose 119 million that it intended to use for substance use prevention and other early intervention health services for youth across the state. it also said the los angeles county department of public health would lose 45 million that it intended to use in part to prevent the spread of measles and bird flu. a spokeswoman for the county said the funding cuts would eliminate staff that work to mitigate disease spread in homeless shelters, schools, jails and worksites curtail work by the county mobile infectious disease team to provide vaccines and other healthcare to homebound residents, seniors at housing developments, senior centers and others confined to living facilities and forestall upgrades to county data systems and other infrastructure needed to track infectious diseases and share timely outbreak information with the public. some of those system upgrades are already underway, meaning cutting the funding now will waste past investments, in addition to increasing the likelihood of system failures during emergencies, the spokeswoman said. the cdc funding cuts are part of a much larger effort by the trump administration and trumps efficiency advisor elon musk to radically reduce federal spending, in part to pay for tax cuts that critics allege will disproportionately benefit the rich. musk, the worlds richest man, and his department of government efficiency, which is not a real government department, have been granted access to sensitive government facilities, computer networks and other data and have been empowered to slash away at government budgets which california is also suing over. the cdc cuts are not the first to public health. kennedy also has announced plans to reduce the health department workforce by some 20,000 employees, and the trump administration reportedly intends to close various health and human services buildings including in california. on tuesday, rep. nancy pelosi d-san francisco issued a statement denouncing what she called a reported decision to close a health and human services regional office in san francisco by kennedy, whom she called the trump administrations leading vaccine denialist a nod to his past adoption of vaccine pseudoscience that medical experts have widely rejected and criticized. by closing our regional office, the trump administration would choose to put the health and safety of bay area residents and all californians in jeopardy, gut vital public health initiatives like the ryan white hivaids program, and potentially axe hundreds of career civil servant jobs held by hardworking californians, pelosi said. she said kennedys extreme views on public health are out of step with the vast majority of the american people, that the shortsighted closure would directly harm our most vulnerable communities and make america sicker, and that she and others would be fighting the closure and other cuts to public health. tuesdays lawsuit is the ninth that bontas office has filed against the current trump administration. it has also filed its support for litigants against the administration in at least a half-dozen other cases. california has been ground zero for the h5n1 bird flu since last march. thirty-eight people in the state have been infected with the virus, most of them dairy workers who were exposed while working with infected cows or milk. however, two of the people were children the cause of their infection has not been determined. the virus has also infected 758 dairy herds or more than 75 of the states total dairy herds. there have been eight measles cases in california since the beginning of the year, in addition to thousands of seasonal flu, covid-19, norovirus and other respiratory virus cases.

  Title: Trump administration has set Noaa on ‘non-science trajectory’, workers warn
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-23 15:58:23)
  Content: the trump administration has shunted one of the us federal governments top scientific agencies onto a non-science trajectory, workers warn, that threatens to derail decades of research and leave the us with air thats not breathable and water thats not drinkable. workers and scientists at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa are warning of the drastic impacts of cuts at the agency on science, research, and efforts to protect natural resources. the problems are still there. we still have harmful algal blooms, we still have fisheries that are collapsing, waters you cant swim in. these problems dont go away because we fired all the people who were trying to solve a problem, said one noaa veteran, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. how do you save the arms and legs or the feet and hands when the core is dying? the longtime research scientist with more than 20 years at noaa has taken early retirement. i left because it was just so demoralizing and fearful and scary, they said. trump administration officials are seeking to abolish the scientific research division at noaa, the oceanic and atmospheric research oar office. it is the latest of a series of cuts at the agency that began the second trump administration with 12,000 employees around the world, including more than 6,700 engineers and scientists. the cuts are disrupting the collection of data sets, including recordings of global temperatures in the air and ocean, and that data cannot be replaced, said the noaa veteran. the dismantling of noaa, they said, would harm work in many areas, from finding solutions to combat harmful algae and improving sustainable fisheries to work on new medicines and industrial products and collecting information for disaster preparation. we can look at other countries that are actively making these mistakes, where they have air thats not breathable and water thats not drinkable, they said. i think its done. i think this is done. the enemies are in the gate. i dont see any indication so far of anyone stopping it. theyre just letting it burn. i honestly dont understand how us science will recover. more than 800 probationary employees at the agency were fired, reinstated, then refired this month. employees have reported having their firings backdated and having their health insurance canceled even though premiums were being taken out of their paychecks. rachel brittin, worked as the federal deputy director of external affairs at noaa before she was fired, then reinstated, then fired again as a probationary employee, with just a few months left on her two-year probation. the loss of anybody at noaa is directly connected to services lost by every individual in the united states rachel brittin, noaas former federal deputy director of external affairs the whole situation is a mess, she said. how is noaa going to be able to keep up with the services it provides? i dont know. i dont know how thats going to happen, but its very scary to me. the loss of anybody at noaa is directly connected to services lost by every individual in the united states. contractors for the agency have been furloughed as all noaa contracts over 100,000 have to now be approved by trumps department of commerce secretary, howard lutnick. doge has slated 31 offices and building leases at noaa for termination around the us. nearly 4m in funding to princeton university as part of a cooperative agreement with noaa was cancelled on 8 april. fourteen noaa data services on earthquakes, marine, coastal and estuary science at have been slated for decommissioning, more than twice as many as in 2024. four regional climate centers providing weather analysis tools and data for 21 states in the us have gone dark after lapses in funding, with the remaining two covering the us set to face a funding lapse in june. a reduction in force plan to cut an additional 10 of the agencys workforce is anticipated and at least several hundred workers have taken voluntary buyouts or early retirement according to noaa workers interviewed by the guardian, though noaa and the department of commerce did not disclose the numbers. it seems clear that the actions that have been taken have intentionally reduced our ability to do our jobs, said a noaa scientist who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. youre not expected to get anything done. they said due to firings, early retirements and resignations, scientific research teams around the agency have been left with gaps of expertise that cant be replaced. we are scrambling, they added. we are finding workarounds, but its becoming increasingly difficult. marty kardos, a research molecular geneticist at the northwest fisheries science center at noaa, decided to resign after the agencys violations of their collective bargaining agreement with workers meant he would be forced to move from montana to seattle in a week or resign. the agency is on a non-science trajectory, kardos said, speaking in a personal capacity. all the plans for research we were making for the upcoming years are out of the window. morale is extremely bad. the attrition of scientists and management at noaa is effectively undermining the agencys ability to sustainably manage fisheries and identify and recover endangered species, he said. the agency is essentially, openly hostile to their mission and their people, kardos added. a lot of this seems to be related to deregulation. the agency is responsible for the endangered species act for marine species and one way to hamstring the act without repealing it is to get rid of the scientists who help to implement it. theyre just letting it burn. i honestly dont understand how us science will recover noaa scientist the cuts come as the so-called department of government efficiency doge and the trump administration have installed allies in key positions at the agency. neil jacobs, the trump nominee for noaa administrator and acting head of noaa in the first trump administration, has yet to be confirmed. jacobs was caught up in sharpiegate a bizarre 2019 incident when the white house was accused of altering a noaa map of the predicted path of hurricane dorian with a black marker to support an incorrect claim by trump that the florida-bound storm would also hit alabama. a staffer from doge, bryton shang, announced this month he was appointed as a senior adviser to the noaa administrator. shang was one of the two doge staffers who flew to los angeles during the wildfires in january, and attempted to open a large water pump system in california. erik noble, dubbed trumps eyes and ears at noaa during his first administration, is back at the agency as deputy assistant secretary for oceans and atmosphere and is reviewing contracts at the agency with keegan mclaughlin, a special assistant at the commerce department and former intern for the 2024 trump campaign. noaa was a target of project 2025, the conservative roadmap for a second trump administration. that document pushed to break up noaa and labeled the agency one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry. understanding things lets us make decisions that can put us on a track to things getting better. knowing bad news doesnt create the bad news. it lets you be prepared to take actions that may let you avoid the worst consequences, the noaa scientist at oar added on the trump appointees and the authority they are being given over scientific decisions. pretending that our resources are inexhaustible doesnt make them inexhaustible, they added. i dont think people understand the arrogance of thinking hey, i think i understand this, even though i know nothing about it. this whole antithesis to experts, i dont understand it. would you want to do that with your own personal health? why would you do it with any kind of complex system? noaa and the department of commerce did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

  Title: California’s economy was already sluggish before Trump’s global tariffs - CalMatters
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 07:01:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article highlights the economic challenges facing California, particularly focusing on the impact of tariffs and internal policies. The text states, "president trumps unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on california families, businesses, and our economy..." and "tariffs could hit southern californias most important economic driver...especially hard." This suggests that the article is attempting to frame tariffs as a primary issue affecting California's economy, potentially influencing public perception and policy priorities.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that "californias economic woes predate trump. much of it was self-inflicted." This statement, while acknowledging external factors like tariffs, subtly shifts blame towards internal policies. What specific state policies are contributing most significantly to these "self-inflicted" wounds, and why are they not explored in greater detail within the article?

      > Snippet: last week, gov. gavin newsom and attorney general rob bonta filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of president donald trumps broad imposition of tariffs on imported goods.
    - Goods Movement Alliance:
      > Snippet: the goods movement alliance, a coalition of business groups, is backing newsoms challenge to tariffs, but also cites the states policies, industrial electricity rates twice the national average and high gasoline and diesel fuel prices as negative factors, as well as new pollution controls on ships and anti-warehousing legislation.
    - legislature:
      > Snippet: as gabe petek, the legislatures budget analyst, said in a january response to newsoms state revenue forecast, these gains are not tied to improvements in the states broader economy, which has been lackluster, with elevated unemployment, a stagnant job market outside of government and healthcare, and sluggish consumer spending.
    - Gavin Newsom:
      > Snippet: newsom and the legislature are planning a major increase in state subsidies to keep production in california, but it may be too little and too late.
      > Snippet: president trumps unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on california families, businesses, and our economy, driving up prices and threatening jobs, newsom said in a statement.

impacted by policy or its absence. learn more here. last week, gov. gavin newsom and attorney general rob bonta filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of president donald trumps broad imposition of tariffs on imported goods. president trumps unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on california families, businesses, and our economy, driving up prices and threatening jobs, newsom said in a statement. the tariffs could have all of those negative impacts, but californias economy was already sluggish. as gabe petek, the legislatures budget analyst, said in a january response to newsoms state revenue forecast, these gains are not tied to improvements in the states broader economy, which has been lackluster, with elevated unemployment, a stagnant job market outside of government and healthcare, and sluggish consumer spending. california has more than a million unemployed workers and its unemployment rate is tied for second-highest among the states. jobs growth remains concentrated in government and government supported health care and social services while other private industries in total continue to shed jobs, according to the center for jobs and the economy, an arm of the california business roundtable trade group. virtually every major segment of californias economy has been facing stiff headwinds in recent years, but the only one enjoying political notice has been southern californias film industry, which is seeing other states and nations lure production away with lower costs and subsidies. those business decisions have considerable consequences for the industrys thousands of middle-class workers the camera operators, set decorators and lighting technicians who make movies and television happen, the new york times reported. δdocument.getelementbyid ak_js_1 .setattribute value, new date .gettime newsom and the legislature are planning a major increase in state subsidies to keep production in california, but it may be too little and too late. meanwhile, the substantial loss of technology jobs in the bay area so far this year is a huge shock to the bay area economy and labor market, scott anderson, chief economist with bmo capital markets, recently told the east bay times. the technology job loss trend has been in place for some time now, but the deterioration in the first two months of the year is concerning. tariffs could hit southern californias most important economic driver the twin ports of long beach and los angeles and the warehouse complexes in the regions interior especially hard. but this sector was already facing rising costs that undercut its competitiveness. the goods movement alliance, a coalition of business groups, is backing newsoms challenge to tariffs, but also cites the states policies, industrial electricity rates twice the national average and high gasoline and diesel fuel prices as negative factors, as well as new pollution controls on ships and anti-warehousing legislation. californias largest-in-the-nation agricultural industry, including its famous winemaking sector, is also shrinking, largely due to uncertain water supplies, labor shortages and the same high costs for electricity and fuel that the logistics industry faces. the public policy institute of california has estimated that, even in the best-case scenario, some 500,000 acres may need to be fallowed in the san joaquin valley due to restrictions on pumping irrigation water from underground aquifers. finally, even though government has been californias foremost employment driver including government-financed medical services in recent years, it is also facing bleak times. the state budget is mired in what fiscal experts call a structural deficit and virtually every major city, some counties and large school districts are in the same pickle. los angeles and san francisco are particularly plagued after several years of of overspending and their leaders, such as los angeles mayor karen bass, are warning that layoffs may be inevitable. trumps tariffs might make things worse, but californias economic woes predate trump. much of it was self-inflicted. read more from calmatters get breaking news on your

  Title: A federal judge is demanding a fix for L.A.'s broken homelessness system. Is receivership his next step?
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-02 10:00:16)
  Content: u.s. district judge david o. carter, seen here in 2021, excoriated the city and county over an audit of l.a.s homelessness programs and said he would consider a proposal to put the programs under a receivership. with the top city and county elected officials sitting in his jury box, the judge lectured for more than an hour, excoriating what he called the rocky horror picture show of homeless services in los angeles. but when it came time to reveal the drastic remedy anticipated by a courtroom full of spectators, u.s. district judge david o. carter hit pause. he gave mayor karen bass and los angeles county board of supervisors chairwoman kathryn barger until may to fix the broken system, vowing only then to become your worst nightmare should they fail. i think as elected officials, youve inherited an extraordinarily difficult task, he told them. and i imagine you came to court today thinking that hell and brimstone would rain upon you. quite the opposite. at the end of this, im going to be asking if theres anything that your branch of government can do to resolve the problems that have been presented to you. an attorney in the case, alleging that the city had failed to meet its obligations in a settlement agreement, urged carter to employ his ultimate weapon appointing a receiver to run the citys homelessness programs. but that prospect led the often blustery judge to turn openly introspective, ruminating on the limits of his power and the risks of using it to try to reverse decades of mismanagement by other branches of government. so unless the two of you can work this out in some way, the courts going to have to, he told bass and barger. and im not sure what to do about that because then i am intruding. ive got a great chance of a reversal on appeal, i understand that. but if i dont, then im complicit, im sitting here doing nothing. his dilemma arises from a 5-year-old lawsuit brought by the l.a. alliance for human rights, a nonprofit organization of business owners, property owners and residents. it alleged that the city and county had failed to address street homelessness. through an order and a settlement agreement reached earlier in the case, the city is required to create nearly 20,000 new beds for homeless people and remove about 10,000 tents and vehicles from the streets. a separate settlement requires the county to pay for services at some of the city beds and to create 3,000 new mental health beds. california court-ordered audit finds major flaws in l.a.s homeless services an audit of homeless services provided by los angeles and the los angeles homeless services authority found them disjointed and lacking adequate data systems and financial controls. carters oversight of those agreements took a sharp turn last year when the alliance law firm, umhofer, mitchell and king, accused the city of noncompliance and asked the judge to fine it 6.4 million. he declined to do that but, in place of sanctions, pressured the city to pay for an outside audit of its accounting for billions of dollars it has spent on homeless services. that audit, released late in february, found disjointed services and inadequate financial controls leaving the citys homelessness programs susceptible to waste and fraud. but it focused particularly on the lack of accountability at the los angeles homeless services authority, a joint agency formed in the 1990s to manage homeless services for the city and county. through the 2017 measure h homelessness sales tax and an infusion of city and state funds, lahsas budget has grown more than seven times over to its current 875 million. calling last weeks hearing to explore the ramifications of the audit, carter requested the agencys chief executive, va lecia adams kellum, to attend, along with bass, barger, city council president marqueece harris-dawson, city controller kenneth mejia and gov. gavin newsom. the judge treated newsoms absence as a predictable annoyance. he has a blog, and hes busy blogging. but he lamented that he had no authority to compel adams kellums, who was then giving an address at harvard university, to be present since lahsa is not a named party to the lawsuit. twice he suggested the agency should be sued, bringing it under his jurisdiction. the judges outrage over the state of homelessness poured forth for more than an hour as he quoted from a handful of audits going back decades that, over and over, faulted lahsa for poor accounting procedures. so this isnt new, carter said. this is old news to elected officials and to lahsa. theres no auditing going on. theres no transparency. theres no accountability. but his posture turned skeptical when l.a. alliance attorney matthew umhofer said he planned to petition for a receiver. whats this supposed to look like? carter asked sharply. whats the function of this receiver? what are they going to do? the receiver, from our perspective, becomes the homelessness czar for the city, umhofer replied. its going to have to be an 800-pound gorilla, carter said. umhofer said that he would not propose names off the cuff but that it should be someone with gravitas, such as kenneth feinberg, the lawyer who oversaw the compensation for 911 claims. anybody know what his fees are? carter asked. i do. in a back-and-forth on what a receiver could do, umhofer said it might include control of the budget around homelessness in los angeles. carter found that problematic. nobody elected the court, nobody elected the receivership, he said. that could be construed as a real intrusion of power. and im trying to get a resolution from you, but lets hear the drama of this for just a moment, because im having trouble sorting through what this would even potentially look like. umhofer argued that the remedy needed to be extraordinary because the failure of the city and the county is extraordinary. because the city has failed, he said, the receiver would have authority vested by the court to commandeer what it needs within the city in order to solve this problem. thats really a dramatic action by a court, carter said. and if that was ever to be considered, i need to be very certain what the attainable goals are and why the legislative and executive branch cant accomplish this. because they have not accomplished it, your honor. thats exactly the point . because the executive and legislative branches have failed. could the receiver, carter asked, order los angeles city councilmember traci park to proceed with an unpopular housing project in venice that she has blocked? if we need to overcome some nimbyism to get shelter and housing built,we should absolutely empower a receiver to do that, umhofer said. its the kind of power that i would expect this court to exercise if faced with that question. when he continued to press the issue, carter asked are you asking that the court take over the entire city? first of all, i would be working with a bureaucracy that is not functioning from my situation. i dont know that i want to work with those same people anymore. thats doomed to failure. finally, he said, go back and think, if youre asking for this drama of a receivership, how that really works and why the court would be more effective. no mention was made during the hearing of the looming decision made by the board of supervisors on tuesday to strip lahsa of 375 million in annual funding and shift it into a new county department. carter gave no indication whether he would view that as a positive step or a distraction. but, in response to a question from the times, umhofer partner elizabeth mitchell later said the move did not address their complaints about the city, characterizing it as no more than moving the deck chairs around the titanic. there needs to be some massive structural changes to address the underlying issues, and i cant see them proposing anything that will possibly come close, mitchell wrote in an email. the firm will soon file a motion asking carter to appoint a receiver, she said.

california has won a 2.4 million wrongful termination lawsuit, but no one can locate him. eight years ago, daniel ridge, 49, sued his former employer, alameda health system, claiming he was wrongfully fired from his job at a county morgue. he was also battling mental health issues at the time. last month, an alameda county superior court jury ruled in his favor and awarded him 2.4 million for his wrongful termination, according to the los angeles times. when the verdict dropped, ridge was not in court. according to the paper, ridges mental condition has deteriorated over the last eight years to the point where he was unable to testify in his case and eventually fell into homelessness. he reported becoming estranged from his family, including his 10-year-old son. even ridges lawyers cannot find him. lawrance bohm, ridges attorney, said that finding him will require a tremendous effort. donald whitehead, the executive director for the national coalition for the homeless, had similar concerns, telling the la times that theres only so much information shelters can collect and provide when someone is searching for a specific individual. ive seen many times people searching for loved ones, he said. but theres protections for people and their identity, so its a challenge when people get lost in the system. whats known about ridge is that he lived somewhere in california during the 1980s and 1990s. six of his friends died in gang-related violence, and in his 20s his uncle was reportedly killed in front of him when a co-worker set him on fire with a molotov cocktail. open image in gallery lawrance bohms client daniel ridge suffers from ptsd and depression and fell into homelessness during the covid-19 pandemic bohm law group two of ridges cousins died by suicide after that incident, according to a news statement released by the bohm law group, which represented ridge. the terrible life of mr. ridge left him with ptsd that went undiagnosed or untreated for decades as he lacked the resources to treat his condition, the law firm wrote. ridge eventually became a certified nursing assistant and began working as a part-time morgue attendant at highland hospital in oakland, which is run by alameda health system. his work was generally complimented in his evaluations until 2013, when the morgues full-time attendant took a leave of absence and then retired the following year. the full-time duties at the morgue fell to ridge, and he was forced to work seven days a week while only receiving part-time pay. this meant that, among other things, mr. ridge did not receive any employee benefits, including health insurance, according to the lawsuit. ridge reportedly complained about his work hours and lack of proper compensation on multiple occasions. in 2015, the hospital opened up hiring for the full-time position and made ridge re-interview and apply for the job he was already doing. he was ultimately awarded the job. his issues with his job continued. he complained that he was forced to use a landline and go to a hospital library on a different floor when he needed to research medical conditions relating to the bodies in the morgue, which other employees did not have to do. he also raised concerns after the hospital changed the way it disposed of formaldehyde, saying the new process left him feeling dizzy and suffering from shortness of breath and blurred vision. ridge asked for respiratory equipment multiple times but was only granted his request after 17 months of asking. he raised further concerns about how the hospital handled bodies, noting that some would be left on gurneys outside the morgue with just a sheet covering them. the spilling and leaking of bodily fluids from dead bodies was not only due to a lack of body bags, but also due to the fact that bodies would occasionally be delivered to the morgue with intravenous tubes still attached to them and with needles and other hospital sharps still lying on the gurneys, the lawsuit said. the attorneys claimed that ridges working conditions triggered his undiagnosed ptsd which he was formally diagnosed with in september 2015 leading to him being put on medical leave until october 4 of that year. after he returned to work, he suffered a panic attack and was told by his psychiatrist to take another six days off work. when ridge returned to work on november 1 with family medical leave act paperwork that he was told would enable him to take unpaid, job-protected leave while he recovered he was told her was being fired. he was escorted out of the hospital by law enforcement, and later filed his wrongful termination suit. according to his lawyers, ridge was doing alright until the pandemic hit in 2020, and his condition degraded and ultimately left him homeless and disconnected from his family. alameda health systems said in a statement that it takes its employees mental and physical health seriously, but noted it disagreed with the jurys verdict and suggested it would appeal the ruling. after a thorough investigation, ahs determined that mr. ridges allegations were not supported by fact and that ahs acted appropriately and consistently with all laws and regulations, it said in a statement. however, ahs otherwise disagrees with the jurys verdict and believes that, when reviewed by the court of appeal, the portions of the jurys verdict favoring the plaintiff are not supported by the evidence.

  Title: County supervisors create new homeless agency, despite warnings from L.A. mayor
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-02 01:33:12)
  Content: the los angeles county board of supervisors approved a plan to move hundreds of millions of dollars out of the regions homeless services agency on tuesday, despite warnings from l.a. mayor karen bass about creating a massive disruption in the regions fight against homelessness. on a 4-0 vote, the supervisors signed off on the strategy to form a new county homelessness department with a budget that would almost immediately exceed 1 billion. by july 2026, the supervisors will move more than 300 million from measure a, a half-percent sales tax, out of the los angeles homeless services authority, or lahsa, and into the new county agency. more than 700 county workers will be transferred to the new agency by jan. 1. six months later, the new department will finish taking on hundreds more employees from lahsa, a joint city-county agency that has been derided for years by city council members, county supervisors and other officials. county supervisors said the changes will give them more direct oversight, and ultimately, greater accountability, over the funds generated by the measure a half-percent sales tax, which went into effect on tuesday. that measure, which provides funding for an array of housing and homelessness services, served as a replacement for measure h, a quarter-percent sales tax approved in 2017. this moment is about the county taking the dollars that taxpayers have entrusted to us and investing them in what works, said supervisor lindsey horvath, who spearheaded the plan. supervisors said they were following the recommendations of a blue ribbon commission, which called in 2022 for the creation of a new county homelessness organization and the streamlining of lahsas responsibilities. they also voiced frustration over a pair of stinging audits that sharply criticized lahsas oversight, or lack of it, over its contracts and programs. the vote was a serious defeat for bass, who had argued that the changes would result in the creation of yet another bureaucracy, while diverting energy away from efforts to move people indoors. with a huge chunk of its budget slated to disappear, lahsas long-term future is now in question. hours before the meeting, bass and city councilmember nithya raman, who heads the councils homelessness committee, sent the supervisors a letter warning that the changes would ultimately deprive the city of essential resources. this action would create a monumental disruption in the progress we are making and runs the serious risk of worsening our homelessness crisis, not ending it, they wrote. five council members bob blumenfield, ysabel jurado, tim mcosker, katy yaroslavsky and raman showed up in person to deliver a similar message, saying they feared the county was delivering a fatal blow to lahsa, one that would undermine their own efforts to combat homelessness. the city is already in a financial crisis, facing a budget shortfall of just under 1 billion. raman said she and other council members had campaigned for measure a, encouraging l.a. residents to increase the sales tax. i believe strongly that these voters may not have supported it if they knew the dollars would be moved into the county without input and partnership from the city, she said. for lahsa, which was formed in 1993 as part of an effort to ensure that the city and county work more collaboratively on homelessness, the decision will produce a financial earthquake. the county provides the largest share of lahsas 875-million annual budget 40, or about 348 million, according to the agencys website. the vast majority of the countys funds would go to the new agency, according to lahsa officials. horvath said the county, soon to be flush with measure a revenue, cannot afford to continue the status quo. combining homelessness programs from multiple county departments will fundamentally transform oversight and accountability, she said. the new agency will be modeled after the county department of health services housing for health program, which horvath called the the most successful program across anything being done in the county to date. that initiative, she said, has a high success rate of moving people into permanent housing and keeping them housed. housing for health began in 2012 to house homeless patients who rotated through the countys public hospitals, said sarah mahin, the programs director, in remarks to the supervisors tuesday. since then, it has expanded to more than 600 workers and an 875-million annual budget. the program includes homeless outreach teams, financial assistance for tenants at risk of eviction and funds for roughly 3,200 interim housing beds. we can do big things things that work, horvath said. housing for health works, and the board of supervisors created it. donyielle holley, homeless programs supervisor for the city of pomona, welcomed the changes, saying they will ensure that the homeless services system is responsible to the needs of all stakeholders. the county will be more accountable to the voters who passed measure a, she said. but supervisor holly mitchell, whose south l.a. district stretches from koreatown to carson, warned her colleagues that they were moving too quickly and without a clear strategy to ensure the replacement agency will perform better than lahsa. california court-ordered audit finds major flaws in l.a.s homeless services an audit of homeless services provided by los angeles and the los angeles homeless services authority found them disjointed and lacking adequate data systems and financial controls. mitchell attempted to postpone the start date for the new agency, only to be outvoted. she abstained from voting on the proposal itself. va lecia adams kellum, lahsas chief executive, attempted to spell out her agencys accomplishments over the past two years, only to have her mic cut off partway into her remarks. supervisor kathryn barger gave her 90 seconds, 30 more than other members of the public. nathaniel vergow, deputy chief programs officer at lahsa, told the board that he has spent his entire professional career working to end homelessness and was open to exploring any efforts to meaningfully move the needle. however, what i dont understand is the rush of the proposed strategy of moving all services with no real plan in place, he said. a timeline is not a plan. last summer, lahsa reported that unsheltered homelessness those living on the street declined by about 5 across the county and by more than 10 in the city of l.a. lahsa executives have promised to reveal more progress in the coming weeks. critics say progress has been far too slow, particularly when contrasted with the billions of dollars that have been allocated. one audit, commissioned by u.s. district judge david o. carter, found that lahsa lacks sufficient financial oversight to ensure that its contractors deliver the services they are paid to provide, leaving the agency vulnerable to waste and fraud. last week, adams kellum sent carter a letter saying her agency is working to improve its operations. carter, who has been overseeing a case involving homelessness services, responded by calling those promises meaningless. barger said she and her colleagues are not trying to get rid of lahsa. and she promised that accountability for the new homelessness department will rest with the five county supervisors. i can only speak for myself, having been in judge carters courtroom last week it cant get any worse, she said.

  Title: Maryland Lawmakers Pass Bill to Limit Future Liabilities Amid Thousands of Claims of Sexual Abuse
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-05 20:39:35)
  Content: annapolis, md. ap maryland lawmakers passed a measure saturday to try to limit future liabilities from claims of sexual abuse at state and private institutions after thousands of people unexpectedly came forward with allegations of abuse, many of them in youth detention centers, putting potentially billions of dollars at stake for the state. the wave of cases targeting the states juvenile justice system resulted after maryland eliminated the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse claims two years ago with the catholic church abuse scandal in mind. the measure, which now goes to gov. wes moore, reduces caps on settlements from 890,000 to 400,000 for cases filed after may 31 for state institutions and from 1.5 million to 700,000 for private institutions. it also changes the 2023 law to only allow each claimant to receive one payment, instead of being able to collect for each incident of abuse. in california on friday, los angeles county officials announced they had reached a 4 billion agreement to settle nearly 7,000 claims of sexual abuse in juvenile facilities since 1959. other private and public entities have been rocked by allegations of wide-ranging abuse and subsequent settlements. the agreement in california, which still needs a county boards approval, far surpasses a 2.6 billion settlement reached in 2022 with boy scouts of america, which recently renamed itself scouting america. that settlement involved more than 80,000 men who said they were molested as children by scouting leaders and others. maryland state sen. will smith, who chairs the senate judicial proceedings committee, said it has been estimated that maryland is facing a potential liability between 3 billion and 4 billion. smith, a democrat, noted that lawmakers approved the 2023 child victims act in response to a long fight to have justice for victims of child sex abuse, where our prior framework barred some of those claims if you were above the age of 38. but what we could never have anticipated was just the sheer volume of cases that ensued, smith said. during debate saturday, lawmakers said about 1,500 cases already have been filed. in addition, another 4,500 cases are known about, lawmakers said, and attorneys for plaintiffs have been in settlement discussions with maryland attorney general anthony browns office. sen. justin ready, a republican who is the senate minority whip, said the state liability could potentially be even higher than the estimate cited by smith. we just spent all session wrestling with a 3 billion deficit, which is a huge deficit, and weve been fighting about that and debating it discussing it just one settlement from this very well could end up being that entire amount, and that is not the end of this, ready said. sen. chris west said he doubted the provision in the bill that would limit someone to only sue for one individual case, rather than for each incident of abuse, would survive a court challenge, based on prior rulings by the maryland supreme court. if the supreme court follows the guidance of prior supreme court decisions, they will hold that our attempt to deny people the right to file cases to recover for multiple occurrences is unconstitutional, because those rights for the past two years have been vested, west, a republican, said. the people have had the right to file those cases. smith told reporters on friday that he believed a settlement is the optimal solution here. were hoping that the attorney general and the plaintiffs can get together and work out a settlement, smith said. maryland lawmakers passed the child victims act in the immediate aftermath of a scathing investigative report by the attorney generals office that revealed widespread abuse within the archdiocese of baltimore. before its passage, victims couldnt sue after they turned 38. the law change prompted the archdiocese to file for bankruptcy to protect its assets. the maryland supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the law in a 4-3 ruling in february. the measure approved saturday also would cap attorneys fees at 20 for cases that settle out of court and 25 for cases resolved in court. the senate voted 36-7 for the bill on saturday, and the house voted 92-40 for the bill a short time later, sending the bill to the governor. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: California: sea lion attack on teenager raises fears of toxic algae poisoning
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-03 01:47:08)
  Content: a teenager was attacked by a sea lion in southern california, raising concerns that a recent increase in algae-induced poisonings among marine mammals could have elicited the erratic behavior. phoebe beltran initially feared it was a shark when she was bitten repeatedly during a 1000-yard swim test for the junior lifeguards cadet program in long beach on 30 march. relatives onshore saw the sea lion pop its head out of the water before it swam away, the los angeles times reported. beltran, 15, was briefly hospitalized and treated for injuries to her arm. little could be done to determine why exactly the sea lion became unusually aggressive. but the act aligns with symptoms observed in animals afflicted by toxic algae, which has sickened hundreds of animals off the southern california coast since late february. related superpod of more than 2,000 dolphins frolic off california coast like flying eyebrows a surfer bitten by a sea lion near oxnard in late march told cbs news hed never experienced anything like the terrifying altercation and that the animals expression was feral, almost demonic, devoid of the curiosity or playfulness id always associated with sea lions. although lethargy, disorientation, and abnormal neurologic behavior seizurestremoring are typical primary behaviors for sea lions impacted by the neurotoxin, erratic and sometimes aggressive behavior can occur, said giancarlo rulli, a spokesperson for the marine mammal center, in an email. he added that bites by seals and sea lions are rare, but warned members of the public to always avoid engaging with marine life and to stay at least 150ft away from animals on beaches. responders with the west coast marine mammal stranding network, a consortium of experts and organizations that intervene when animals are in danger, have reported more than 100 calls a day as scores of sea lions and dolphins wash up on shores. the need has been so great in recent weeks, teams have had to make tragic decisions, helping only those with the best chance of survival. if they receive treatment quickly, sea lions have a 50-65 chance of survival. for dolphins, ingesting the toxin is almost always deadly. this is the fourth year in a row that there has been a major outbreak from domoic acid in california, a troubling development thats becoming more intense, common, and unpredictable, according to rulli. the most recent toxic algae bloom occurred earlier in the year than normal and has hit hardest along the coast between santa barbara and los angeles. the algae typically grows after a wind-driven upwelling that churns deep ocean water full of nutrients closer to the surface. fish are first to ingest the acid produced by the algae, which then poisons the animals that eat them. this year, the timing and location with the first poisoning documented around 20 february near malibu, california has spurred questions over whether this could have been caused by debris from the los angeles fires that swept through the area in january. but the climate crisis has long been a culprit of the rising risks, as increasing temperatures and changing ocean conditions help fuel the growth of this algae. this years early start to the issue comes just two years after the worst domoic acid bloom on record claimed the lives of at least 1,000 marine mammals along the southern california coast in just a single month. it does take an emotional toll in the field, john warner, chief executive officer of the marine mammal care center in los angeles, said in a post shared by noaa fisheries. year after year, its getting tough. each of our organizations is trying hard to get to as many animals as we can, but we dont have the resources to rescue every one that is out there.

  Title: Museums' funding slashed by DOGE order. One L.A. museum vows to fight
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-04 21:28:40)
  Content: survivors from japanese american incarceration camps during world war ii are among those lining up for an event at the japanese american national museum in 2022. the letter to the japanese american national museum on friday morning from the national endowment for the humanities read in part due to a change in the administrations funding priorities, doge has made the decision to terminate neh awards. the los angeles museum had seen this coming. on wednesday night, state humanities councils across the country had begun receiving similar letters stating that their neh funding had been terminated, one day after elon musks department of government efficiency visited neh headquarters. by friday, the scope of the neh cuts was crystallizing as arts and humanities organizations began grappling with the loss of money previously approved by congress, and social media lighted up with reports of neh staffers being put on administrative leave. the 175,000 neh grant that janm lost was for the museums landmarks of american history and culture workshops. now in its third year, the program brings teachers from across the country to l.a.s little tokyo to learn about japanese american history, including the mass incarceration of u.s. citizens by their own government during world war ii, a civics lesson aimed at preventing history from repeating. over the last two years, more than 100 teachers from 31 states have attended the two-week program and shared their experiences and new knowledge with approximately 21,000 students. this is impacting many museums in the united states, especially cultural and ethnic museums, japanese american national museum board chairman bill fujioka said of the neh decision. we already have a signed contract with the federal government for that money. and weve been told its being clawed back. the neh grant money being rescinded was mostly allocated on a reimbursement basis, fujioka said meaning organizations were expected to spend the money first, then get reimbursed. the neh letter amounts to a refusal to reimburse those expenses, despite earlier neh approval. fujioka said the japanese american national museum was worried about the loss of not only neh funding but also money allocated through the institute of museum and library sciences, which awarded 26.4 million in grants and research funding to cultural organizations in california last year. its staff was put on administrative leave late last month. organizations such as the japanese american national museum have feared losing their federal funding ever since president trump took office and began his campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion, fujioka said, adding that many organizations have scrubbed their websites to remove any reference to dei. the japanese american national museum will scrub nothing, fujioka said, and instead will highlight the importance of dei. our community is based on diversity, equity is guaranteed to us in the constitution, and inclusion is what we believe in, fujioka said. local museums that could be affected by imls funding cuts include the los angeles county museum of art, which was awarded 744,095 through the organization last year, as well as uclas fowler museum 188,808 and the autry museum of the american west 70,617. lacma confirmed to the times that it received a letter terminating its neh grant, but the museum declined further comment. the times has reached out to a dozen california museums to discuss potential neh or imls funding cuts no others have agreed to speak on the record. fujioka said his museum has grants from neh and imls totaling 2 million 1.45 million of which was approved during the biden administration but which the museum is bracing to never materialize and 522,000 in grants applied for but not yet awarded. of the approved grants, 750,000 was part of the neh program save americas treasures, devoted to historic preservation. fujiokas museum earmarked that funding for a climate control and hvac system upgrade that will help to preserve 160,000 artifacts. fujioka said the museum is considering taking legal action on behalf of all museums losing previously approved funding, but janm president and chief executive ann burroughs said the idea has not yet been explored in detail. it is an option that is open to us, and we would certainly join a class action lawsuit, she said. we know that the actions that are being taken are not lawful because this is essentially approved funding, said rick noguchi, president and chief executive of california humanities, a state affiliate of the neh, which was notified wednesday night that its funding had been eliminated. the california humanities council gets about 3.5 million annually from the neh, which accounts for 90 of its budget. the organization is designed to funnel federal money to educational programs at california museums, libraries and schools, among other places. noguchi said humanities councils across the country might band together to ask for a court injunction to prevent the funding loss, which he said would be devastating. he described the reaction of state humanities councils as the neh notices were landing. it was a parade of letters that were being posted on a directors listserv, because every state has a humanities council, and so it seemed like they were going alphabetically, noguchi said. he added that this is funding appropriated by congress. theres a line item in national endowment for the humanities budget called the federal state partnership. the neh was established by congress in 1965. it provides grants for humanities projects to organizations including museums, archives, libraries, colleges and scholars. a longtime neh official, michael mcdonald, is the agencys acting director. he took over last month after the previous director shelly c. lowe, a biden appointee resigned under pressure. the new york times reported that mcdonald told neh officials this week that the agency would focus on patriotic programming. mcdonald signed the california humanities council letter, which was reviewed by the times and read in part your grants immediate termination is necessary to safeguard the interests of the federal government, including its fiscal priorities. the termination of your grant represents an urgent priority for the administration, and due to exceptional circumstances, adherence to the traditional notification process is not possible. the neh did not respond to a request for comment.

  Content: a view of the kenneth hahn hall of administration building, left, with city hall in the background in december 2024. saddled with about 2 billion in fire recovery costs and the largest sex abuse case settlement in u.s. history, the los angeles county government is facing about 89 million in budget cuts. to close the budget gap, the county will have to leave hundreds of vacant positions unfilled, but no layoffs are expected, said fesia davenport, the countys chief executive, at a news briefing monday. the fire recovery estimate includes 1 billion in lost revenue, mostly from property taxes, and 1 billion to cover soil testing, debris removal and beach cleanup and other costs, davenport said. the county can be reimbursed by the federal government for some of those costs, but must front the money. davenport said the reimbursements for the january fires, which devastated altadena, pacific palisades and surrounding areas, could take years. l.a. county announced this month that it planned to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of child sexual abuse that occurred in juvenile facilities and foster homes, most from the 1980s through the 2000s. if approved by the board of supervisors later this month, it will be the largest sex abuse claims settlement in u.s. history. we knew that the cost of the settlement would be unprecedented, and that it would have a devastating impact on our budget, davenport said at the briefing, where she unveiled the countys roughly 48-billion recommended budget for the upcoming fiscal year. the sex abuse claims arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to sue, even though the statue of limitations had passed. thousands of men and women came forward saying they had been sexually abused as children while in county custody. davenport said the county expects to pay hundreds of millions of dollars every year until 2030, followed by smaller payments through 2051. in addition to taking out bonds, she said, the county will need to tap into its rainy day fund, which has about 1 billion in it. i cannot remember the last time we tapped into a rainy day fund, she said. davenport added that home sales in l.a. county have declined by 41 since 2021, putting more pressure on the county budget, which relies heavily on property taxes. in the city of los angeles, the top budget official has said that layoffs are nearly inevitable, with a budget shortfall of nearly 1 billion due in part to ballooning legal payouts, weaker than expected tax revenue and pay raises for city employees. under davenports recommended spending plan, most county departments would make a 3 budget cut, and 310 vacant positions, out of about 117,000 budgeted positions, would be eliminated countywide. davenport declined to say whether layoffs were anticipated in future years. when you start talking about layoffs prematurely, it makes people very nervous, she said. you start a rumor mill. the public works, regional planning and mental health departments, as well as the sheriffs department, would be exempt from the cuts, according to a county spokesperson. the trump administration has further complicated the financial picture for l.a. county, which receives at least 13 of its budget from the federal government. the county department of public health was recently notified that it would lose about 45 million in federal grants related to covid-19, a decision that davenport said has been blocked by a temporary restraining order, for now. the potential for federal funding cuts is very real and could destabilize the countys budget, she said. davenport said the recommended budget includes 1.1 billion in spending for homeless services through measure a, a half-cent sales tax that voters approved in november, and 11.9 million for county government reform approved by voters last year through measure g. the board of supervisors will discuss the recommendations tuesday, with the final budget to be adopted in september.

  Title: Torrance cops strike plea deal in swastika graffiti case that uncovered racist texts
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-10 17:35:13)
  Content: former torrance police officers cody weldin, center, and christopher tomsic, right, plead guilty in a conspiracyvandalism case at the clara shortridge foltz criminal justice center in downtown los angeles. attorney tom yu, defense for weldin, listens to proceedings. two former torrance police officers pleaded guilty thursday to charges they spray-painted a swastika inside a car in 2020, a vandalism incident that revealed the officers were part of a larger text thread in which city cops used racist and homophobic slurs and joked about killing black men. cody weldin, 31, and christopher tomsic, 32, pleaded guilty to one count of felony vandalism each. they will spend two years on probation and must give up their right to serve as law enforcement officers in california, according to the terms of the plea. tomsic and weldin must also give up their firearms, complete 100 hours of community service and 15 hours of anti-racism training, and attend a tour of the museum of tolerance in west los angeles. in 2021, the two ex-officers were accused of spray-painting a swastika inside a vehicle that had been towed from the scene of an alleged mail theft. the victim, kiley swaine, later filed a lawsuit accusing the officers of unlawfully searching his vehicle and expressed fear for his life because of the officers actions, noting his grandfather was jewish. tomsic and weldin declined to be interviewed outside the courtroom, but their attorneys both said the former officers believed the plea deal was a fair resolution. lisa houle said tomsic accepted responsibility virtually from the beginning of the case. he is remorseful and apologizes to the torrance police department and the community for the harm he has caused and the trust that he violated, she said. tom yu, who represented weldin, said he was glad his client could move on with his life. a search warrant executed as part of the vandalism investigation led to a troubling discovery hundreds of text messages in which officers used racist and homophobic slurs, joked about beating and racially profiling suspects and, in some instances, fantasized about killing black people. lucky i wasnt out and about, one officer wrote in response to a text about black men robbing someone in torrance, according to records previously obtained by the times. d.a. shoot team asking me why they are all hung by a noose and shot in the back of the head 8 times each. in another conversation about needlessly beating a female suspect, sgt. brian kawamoto said he wanted to make torrance great again, a play on president trumps ubiquitous campaign slogan. immediately upon learning of the reprehensible allegations in this case, torrance police detectives initiated a vigorous investigation that resulted in criminal charges, and ultimately led to todays guilty pleas, lt. fareed ahmad, a department spokesman, said in a statement. the torrance police department holds its officers to the highest standards of policing, including treating all members of the public with respect as we protect the safety of our community. a previous times investigation which identified most of the officers on the text chain also found several officers in the group had been involved in at least seven serious use-of-force incidents in torrance and long beach between 2013 and 2021. three of those incidents ended in the deaths of black and latino men, according to police use-of-force records and court filings. tomsic and weldin are the first of five officers linked to the scandal to be criminally convicted. three others are awaiting trial. david chandler was charged with assault for shooting a black man in the back in 2018 while the man was experiencing a mental health crisis at his grandmothers home. the victim was brandishing a knife but not threatening anyone at the time of the shooting, according to prosecutors, who said the man was walking away when chandler opened fire. a judge upheld the assault charges at a preliminary hearing in 2023. matthew concannon and anthony chavez are awaiting trial on manslaughter charges in the 2018 killing of christopher deandre mitchell, who was sitting in a car with an air rifle between his knees when the officers fired the fatal rounds. mitchell, a car-theft suspect, was parked in a ralphs parking lot when he was killed. neither officer alleged that mitchell grabbed the weapon or pointed it at them before they began shooting, records show. in the text thread, officers used the n-word to describe mitchells relatives, according to records previously obtained by the times. the name of the officer who sent that text message was redacted in the records. concannon was investigated as part of the scandal, but his attorney says he did not send any racist texts. l.a. county prosecutors initially declined to prosecute the officers, but former dist. atty. george gascón reopened the case, and a grand jury indicted conannon and chavez in 2023. current dist. atty. nathan hochman fired the special prosecutor who brought those charges late last year, but he has appointed a replacement who is currently overseeing the case. vandalizing property with hateful messages is reprehensible and violates the oath police officers take to uphold the law and protect and serve their communities, hochman said. i commend the torrance police department for swiftly taking action against these officers to relieve them of their duties. i also thank deputy district attorneys saeed teymouri and john perroni of our offices justice system integrity division for holding these officers accountable, ensuring they will never again work as police officers in our state. dozens of criminal cases had to be thrown out due to the officers remarks, and several of those involved have been fired. aside from tomsic and weldin, seven other officers linked to the scandal have had their ability to be a police officer in california temporarily suspended by the states commission on peace officer standards and training. a spokesman for the commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. disciplinary records from that board, which were made public earlier this year, identified weldin as the owner of the group text in which many of the racist remarks were found. the group was dubbed the boys, records show. his attorney said that simply meant weldin started the text thread. california atty. gen. rob bonta announced an investigation into the torrance police department in december 2021, the day the times first revealed the contents of the text thread. none of the findings have been made public, and it is unclear what, if any, impact the probe has achieved. a spokesperson for the attorney generals office said this week they could not comment on an ongoing investigation. ahmad said torrance police chief jeremiah hart reached out to the state attorney generals office shortly after the scandal surfaced in 2021, and the department formalized an agreement with the california department of justice in 2022. we have collaborated with the doj throughout the process, providing full access to the department, our employees and records, ahmad said. the goal is to work with the doj to make sure the torrance police department promotes public safety while at the same time ensuring that the public is treated with respect. times staff writer libor jany contributed to this report.

  Title: How financially-stressed LA County plans to pay historic $4 billion sexual abuse settlement - LAist
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-04 23:09:00)
  Content: in an unprecedented move, los angeles county will pay 4 billion as part of a tentative agreement to settle more than 6,800 claims of child sexual abuse that allegedly occurred inside the countys sprawling network of juvenile facilities and foster homes. the tentative settlement between the county and lawyers representing victims is expected to be approved by the county claims board and board of supervisors later this month. the county called the settlement the costliest financial settlement in the history of l.a. county. the massive settlement is far bigger than others involving child sexual abuse. county officials say it would have a significant impact on the countys budget for years to come. if approved, the settlement would resolve most but not all of the claims filed against the county under assembly bill 218. the 2020 legislation waived the statute of limitations, providing a three-year window to allow victims of childhood sexual abuse to come forward. it prompted a wave of claims from people who said they were molested or raped at the hands of probation officers and other staff at county facilities dating back to 1959. the majority of the claims date from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s although some stretch back further in time. they are alleged to have occurred at probation department facilities and at the notorious maclaren childrens center in el monte, which was permanently closed in 2003. maclaren was a county-run foster home that plaintiffs attorneys have called a house of horrors. on behalf of the county, i apologize wholeheartedly to everyone who was harmed by these reprehensible acts, l.a. county chief executive officer fesia davenport said in a statement. the historic scope of this settlement makes clear that we are committed to helping the survivors recover and rebuild their lives and to making and enforcing the systemic changes needed to keep young people safe. l.a. county already was in financial trouble as it faced federal funding cuts from the trump administration, increased costs from the eaton and palisades fires and an uncertain economy. the county plans to pay for the settlement using money from reserve funds, the issuance of bonds and cuts to county departments. davenport did not detail what those cuts might be. the financing will require annual payments totaling hundreds of millions of dollars through 2030 and substantial continuing annual payments through fiscal year 2050-51, according to the news release. plaintiffs attorney patrick mcnicholas, who represents more than 1,200 victims, said the settlement achieves restorative justice. by restorative justice i mean not only is there full and fair compensation, but theres also a societal recognition that a horrible wrong has been committed, he said. sexual abuse became part of the culture at some county institutions, he added not unlike what has been seen in other organizations. youve seen this time and time again not only across the united states but across the world where this culture can permeate an institution. it becomes insular, theres no transparency, mcnicholas said. l.a. county has made numerous reforms over the years to address the problem of child sexual abuse at its facilities, like better vetting of probation officers and foster parents, according to the release. its also seeking new reforms including mcnicholas acknowledged that the county had made substantial changes in recent years. but its not yet clear if theyll have a lasting impact. whether its enough, i dont know, he said.

  Title: Steelhead trout rescued from Palisades fire spawn in their new Santa Barbara County home
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 18:32:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying the concept of ecological resilience, the article highlights the capacity of both the steelhead trout population and the Arroyo Hondo Creek ecosystem to recover from devastating events. The text states that the "watershed…was devastated by a fire four years ago, but has since recovered," and that the transplanted steelhead are now spawning successfully. This suggests that even after significant disturbances, ecosystems and populations can exhibit a degree of self-renewal, given appropriate conditions and interventions.; Intriguing_angles: The article emphasizes the success of the steelhead relocation, but the phrase "some trout will end up making their temporary lodging permanent" hints at a potential unintended consequence. Could this dispersal from the original habitat lead to unforeseen ecological impacts in Arroyo Hondo Creek, or affect the long-term genetic diversity of the steelhead population? What are the potential trade-offs between immediate species survival and the preservation of the original ecosystem's integrity?

  Content: wildlife officials feared critically endangered steelhead trout rescued from the palisades fire burn scar might not be up for spawning after all theyd been through over the last few months. after their watershed in the santa monica mountains was scorched in january, the fish were stunned with electricity, scooped up in buckets, trucked to a hatchery, fed unfamiliar food and then moved to a different creek. it was all part of a liberation effort pulled off in the nick of time. this whole thing is just a very stressful and traumatic event, and im happy that we didnt really kill many fish, said kyle evans, an environmental program manager for the california department of fish and wildlife, which led the rescue. but i was concerned that i might have just disrupted this whole months-long process of getting ready to spawn. steelhead were once abundant in southern california, but their numbers plummeted amid coastal development and overfishing. a distinct southern california population is listed as endangered at the state and federal level. alex vejar california department of fish and wildlife but this month spawn they did. its believed that there are now more than 100 baby trout swishing around their new digs in arroyo hondo creek in santa barbara county. their presence is a triumph for the species and for their adopted home. however, more fish require more suitable habitat, which is lacking in southern california in part due to drought and the increased frequency of devastating wildfires. steelhead trout are the same species as rainbow trout , but they have different lifestyles. steelheads migrate to the ocean and return to their natal streams to spawn, while rainbows spend their lives in freshwater. steelhead were once abundant in southern california, but their numbers plummeted amid coastal development and overfishing. a distinct southern california population is listed as endangered at the state and federal level. the young fish sighted this month mark the next generation of what was the last population of steelhead in the santa monica mountains, a range that stretches from the hollywood hills to point mugu in ventura county. they also represent the return of a species to a watershed that itself was devastated by a fire four years ago, but has since recovered. its believed that there are now more than 100 baby trout swishing around their new digs in arroyo hondo creek in santa barbara county. kyle kusa land trust for santa barbara county the alisal blaze torched roughly 95 of the arroyo hondo preserve located west of santa barbara, and subsequent debris flows choked the creek of the same name that housed steelhead. all the fish perished, according to meredith hendricks, executive director of the land trust for santa barbara county, a nonprofit organization that owns and manages the preserve. to be able to offer space for these fish to be transplanted to when we ourselves had experienced a similar situation but lost our fish it was just a really big deal, hendricks said. arroyo hondo creek bears similarities to the trouts native topanga creek they are both coastal streams of roughly the same size. and it has a bonus feature a state-funded fish passage constructed under highway 101 in 2008, which improved fish movement between the stream and the ocean. spawning is a biologically and energetically demanding endeavor for steelhead, and the process likely began in december or earlier, according to evans. that means it was already underway when 271 steelhead were evacuated in january from topanga creek, a biodiversity hot spot located in malibu that was badly damaged by the palisades fire. it continued when they were hauled about 50 miles north to a hatchery in fillmore, where they hung out until 266 of them made it to arroyo hondo the following month. state wildlife personnel regularly surveyed the fish in their new digs but didnt see the spawning nests, which can be missed. then, on april 7, evans got a text message from the land trusts land programs director, leslie chan, with a video that appeared to show a freshly hatched young-of-the-year the wonky name for fish born during the steelheads sole annual spawn. the following day, evans team was dispatched to the creek and confirmed the discovery. they tallied about 100 of the newly hatched fish. the young trout span roughly one inch and, as evans put it, arent too bright. they hang out in the shallows and dont bolt from predators. theyre kind of just happy to be alive, and theyre not really trying to hide, he said. by the end of summer, evans estimates two-thirds will die off. but the survivors are enough to keep the population charging onward. evans hopes that in a few years, there will be three to four times the number of fish that initially moved in. the plan is to eventually relocate at least some back to their native home of topanga creek. right now, topanga looks pretty bad, evans said. the palisades fire stripped the surrounding hillsides of vegetation, paving the way for dirt, ash and other material to pour into the waterway. another endangered fish, northern tidewater gobies, were rescued from the same watershed shortly before the steelhead were liberated. within two days of the trouts removal, the first storm of the season arrived, likely burying the remaining fish in a muddy slurry. citizen scientists bernard yin, center, and rebecca ramirez, right, join government agency staffers in rescuing federally endangered fish in the topanga lagoon in malibu on jan. 17. christina house los angeles times evans expects it will be about four years before topanga creek is ready to support steelhead again, based on his experience observing streams recover after the thomas, woolsey, alisal and other fires. theres also discussion about moving around steelhead to create backup populations should calamity befall one, as well as boost genetic diversity of the rare fish. for example, some of the steelhead saved from topanga could be moved to malibu creek, another stream in the santa monica mountains that empties into santa monica bay. there are efforts underway to remove the 100-foot rindge dam in malibu creek to open up more habitat for the fish. as we saw, if you have one population in the santa monica mountains and a fire happens, you could just lose it forever, evans said. so having fish in multiple areas is the kind of way to defend against that. with the topanga creek steelhead biding their time up north, its believed there are none currently inhabiting the santa monicas. habitat restoration is key for the species survival, according to evans, who advocates for directing funding to such efforts, including soon-to-come-online money from proposition 4, a 10-billion bond measure to finance water, clean energy and other environmental projects. it doesnt matter how many fish you have, or if youre growing them in a hatchery, or what youre doing, he said. if they cant be supported on the landscape, then theres no point. some trout will end up making their temporary lodging permanent, according to hendricks, of the land trust. arroyo hondo is a long creek with plenty of nooks and crannies for trout to hide in. so when it comes time to bring the steelhead home, she said, im sure some will get left behind.

  Title: Commercial Dungeness crab season closing in Monterey Bay
  Source: www.siliconvalley.com (2025-04-04 22:00:49)
  Content: due to the dangers presented to humpback whales, the california department of fish and wildlife announced it will end commercial and recreational dungeness crab fishing south of pigeon point, including monterey bay and morro bay, on april 15. vertical lines will be allowed to continue in other parts of northern california, including zones 1-3 in half moon bay, san francisco and bodega bay, where whales are now returning to their feeding grounds. this crab season had first opened on jan. 5. officials explained that the whale entanglements off the west coast reached a six-year high in 2024. there are confirmed reports of a humpback whale currently entangled in multiple sets of dungeness crab gear of monterey bay. the same whale has been reported entangled three different times since october. whale entanglement is fatal in 75 of cases, according to the national marine fisheries service. the whales have a difficult time diving and feeding while dragging heavy fishing gear for months, which can cause severe damage and drowning. based on the departments own data, in the last three seasons, 33 humpback whales out of a total of 38 were first sighted entangled after the central california crab season closed, dr. geoff shester, oceanas california campaign director and senior scientist, said in a statement. this repeated pattern of waiting too long to close the fishery is harming endangered whale populations and is a disservice to local fishing communities. scientists estimate that the reported entanglements are only 10 of the actual entanglements, according to oceana . californias plan for reducing whale entanglements is not working, shester said. keeping the bay area and northern california crab season open right now presents an extreme risk to endangered whales with very low reward that will ultimately hurt california fishing communities in the long-term. after a season ends in a fishing zone, fishermen may continue seeking crab while using pop-up fishing gear under experimental fishing permits. this gear stores the rope and buoy with a trap on the seafloor until an acoustic release mechanism sends the buoy to the surface. pop-up gear was tested by 19 fishermen last spring, while waters were closed to conventional crab gear to prevent whale entanglements. these fishermen saw a 98 success rate and yielded 1.5 million worth of crab, according to oceana.

  Title: Sea lions, dolphins, now a whale: Ocean giant is latest victim of SoCal's toxic algal bloom
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:22:18)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article focuses heavily on domoic acid poisoning and its effects on marine life, potentially influencing public perception of environmental threats. The repeated mentions of "domoic acid" and its impact on "marine mammals" serve to highlight this specific issue, potentially overshadowing other environmental concerns. This could lead to increased public attention and policy focus on algal blooms and their toxins, while other ecological problems receive less attention.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions "runoff from the recent fires in palisades as contributors to the algae bloom" but doesn't elaborate on the specific mechanisms or the relative contribution compared to other factors like climate change or upwelling. This omission is intriguing because it could downplay the role of human activities (e.g., land management practices that exacerbate fire risk) in contributing to the algal bloom. What is the relative contribution of fire runoff compared to other factors, and why isn't this quantified or discussed in more detail?
  Key Entities Mentioned:
    - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration:
      > Snippet: michael milstein, spokesperson for the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations west coast regional office, said test results showed the whale had high levels of domoic acid in its urine at the time of its death.
    - Marine Mammal Protection Act:
      > Snippet: theyre protected under the marine mammal protection act.
    - Climate Change:
      > Snippet: other experts also point to climate change and the runoff from the recent fires in palisades as contributors to the algae bloom.

      > Snippet: the pacific marine mammal center in laguna beach is performing a necropsy to determine the animals cause of death.
  Content: a minke whale that was swimming in long beach harbor earlier this month died from domoic acid poisoning associated with a toxic algal bloom that has stricken many other sea creatures, according to officials. michael milstein, spokesperson for the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations west coast regional office, said test results showed the whale had high levels of domoic acid in its urine at the time of its death. this is consistent with the many other marine mammals we have seen affected by domoic acid produced by the harmful algal bloom off southern california first detected in february, milstein said in a statement. the tests are taking longer since the lab is processing so many. domoic acid is a neurotoxin produced by harmful algal blooms that accumulates in filter-feeding fish including anchovies and sardines which are then eaten by seals, sea lions and dolphins. this is the fourth consecutive year there has been a domoic acid event, but this years started much earlier than previous ones, according to milstein. the algae bloom was the result of an upswell in the ocean that brought up enough nutrients to the surface to allow the algae to thrive, he said. other experts also point to climate change and the runoff from the recent fires in palisades as contributors to the algae bloom. hundreds of sea lions and dolphins have been affected so far, milstein said. this has probably been the most severe, particularly this early in the year, he said. how long it continues is the question. the 24-foot-long minke whale was swimming in the harbor for several days and officials had tried to push it out to sea, only for it to come back, milstein said. the whale, which is male, was then found dead april 3. minke whales are considered the smallest of the great, or baleen, whale family, and can grow to more than 26 feet long and weigh as much as 14,000 pounds, according to noaa . there are about 900 minke whales off the coasts of oregon, washington and california. theyre protected under the marine mammal protection act. last week, a dead gray whale was also found washed ashore on huntington beach. the pacific marine mammal center in laguna beach is performing a necropsy to determine the animals cause of death. although most of the marine mammals affected by domoic acid toxicity are california sea lions, other animals are also susceptible to its effects, according to the marine mammal center. domoic acid has been found in blue and humpback whales, as well as guadalupe fur seals, which is a threatened species. ingesting domoic acid from harmful algal blooms can cause sea lions and other animals to have seizures or to crane their heads in a motion known as stargazing. they can also fall into a comatose state. experts advise people not to interact with animals believed to be sick because they might aggressively lunge or even bite. milstein said its unlikely that the domoic acid event will have a significant effect on the overall population of marine mammals off the western coast. theres a silver lining to the incredible productivity of the california ecosystem, he said. on one hand it is feeding the algae bloom, but its also responsible for the incredible diversity of species were fortunate to have off the west coast. these species are pretty strong and resilient and they have shown that over the year.
