  Title: Police seize enough fentanyl ‘to kill everyone in Portland twice,’ arrest 46 in multi-agency trafficking crackdown
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-22 23:31:33)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article highlights a state-level response (law enforcement agencies) to a perceived threat (fentanyl trafficking) originating from a non-state actor (Sinaloa Cartel) across international borders. This aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize security and power in an anarchic international system. The quote 'our partnership with local, state, and federal agencies makes our collective response stronger' exemplifies the state's attempt to consolidate power to address the threat.; Intriguing_angles: The article emphasizes the success of the operation and the collaboration between agencies, but it doesn't delve into the root causes of the drug crisis or the social factors contributing to drug use and trafficking. This omission could be a deliberate choice to focus on the immediate law enforcement response rather than addressing the more complex underlying issues. What are the long-term strategies to address the root causes of drug trafficking and addiction in Portland?

  Content: portland, ore. koin a series of drug trafficking missions conducted in the portland area earlier this year and involving multiple law enforcement agencies yielded 46 arrests and dozens of pounds of illicit drugs seized, authorities said. the missions focused on fentanyl trafficking and were conducted in the month of february. the multi-agency effort involved law enforcement entities on the local, state and federal levels. the crackdown is in response to fentanyl flooding into the pacific northwest from the honduran-based sinaloa cartel, according to the portland police bureau. amr just short of countys compliance standards there was also 204,007 in cash seized, as well as 20 guns, 44 pounds of fentanyl powder and 2,507 fentanyl pills. the illicit drugs seized during the operation which also included 22 pounds of methamphetamine, nine pounds of cocaine and two pounds of heroin was located in part thanks to the use of a k9 police dog. drugs seized. april 22, 2025 courtesy portland police bureau. drugs seized. april 22, 2025 courtesy portland police bureau. drugs seized. april 22, 2025 courtesy portland police bureau. firearm seized. april 22, 2025 courtesy portland police bureau. k9 and drugs seized. april 22, 2025 courtesy portland police bureau. fentanyl has no place in our city. our partnership with local, state, and federal agencies makes our collective response stronger, portland police chief bob day said in a statement. this operation was a success, but it is only one step in a larger, sustained effort to keep portland safe. david f. reames, a special agent with the drug enforcement agency seattle field division, said the amount of fentanyl seized by his team and the other participating agencies could have yielded over 1.5 million lethal doses or enough to kill everyone in portland twice. nearly all of those arrested selling drugs were illegally present in the united states, reames said. these same traffickers had been exploiting children by using them to sell dangerous drugs. the case today highlights our collective success in bringing some accountability to the criminals who sell poison on our streets. in addition to the ppb and the dea, other agencies involved in the recent fentanyl trafficking missions included the federal bureau of investigation, the multnomah county sheriffs office, the multnomah county district attorneys office and the u.s. attorneys office. also assisting in the operation was a special team as part of the high intensity drug trafficking area program, whose participating agencies include the oregon state police and homeland security investigations, among others. ppb chief bob day said collaboration is essential when the challenge of fighting the drug crisis is this big. it makes me proud when i can see us come together across jurisdiction, across federal and state and county boundaries, and find a way to be successful to enhance the safety and security for all portlanders, he said. and thats what these results demonstrate. 2025 nexstar media, inc. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. for the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to koin.com.

  Title: 100 DAYS OF PUNISHING FOES...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article demonstrates how Trump actively shapes the public's perception by prioritizing certain narratives (e.g., 'political weaponization,' 'lies and abuses') and repeatedly emphasizing them. The text states Trump 'repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate' and 'denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him.' This constant reinforcement influences which issues voters deem important, potentially overshadowing other concerns.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the speed and scope of Trump's actions, noting that 'even the smallest slights drawing reprisals.' This suggests a potential underlying mechanism of personal vendettas driving policy decisions, raising questions about the stability and predictability of the administration's actions. What are the long-term consequences of such personalized governance?; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work.' This raises questions about the ethical implications of such arrangements and whether they constitute a form of extortion or coercion. Does this set a dangerous precedent for future interactions between the government and private entities?

  Content: reuters -hours after swearing an oath to defend the u.s. constitution on january 20, president donald trump signed an executive order directing his attorney general to scour the justice department and other agencies for evidence of political weaponization. the same day, pentagon staff took down a portrait of mark milley, a trump critic who as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been the highest-ranking military officer during trumps first term. that evening, trump stripped his former national security adviser, john bolton - who wrote a memoir critical of trump - of the protective secret service detail he had been given after the justice department said iran had threatened boltons life. in his first 100 days, trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies. these include former intelligence officials who investigated alleged russian ties to his 2016 election campaign and major law firms as well as former biden administration members and prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against him while he was out of power. trumps actions served notice that his campaign promise of political retribution was anything but rhetorical, after he repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate. but the speed and sweep of his actions have caught many by surprise, with even the smallest slights drawing reprisals. the republican president has used the machinery of the state and the power of the presidency to go after people and institutions that have aggrieved him in more expansive ways than any of his predecessors, historians said. its not unusual for presidents to have enemies, said jeremi suri, a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin. what is unusual is for the president to use the entirety of the federal government, not simply to exclude someone, but to directly punish them. trump has made particular use of executive orders - typically used by presidents to direct policy priorities - to target perceived foes by stripping them of security clearances, blocking them from government buildings or directing agencies to probe them for wrongdoing. he has launched multiple federal probes into maine after a verbal spat with the states governor, reached deep into the traditionally independent justice department to fire those he views as disloyal, pulled protective security details from his critics and ordered investigations into former officials who challenged his false claims that his 2020 election loss was rigged. on his first day in office, he removed clearances for 50 former national security officials who had signed a letter suggesting russia was behind a story about salacious material found on a laptop belonging to president joe bidens son hunter. no evidence of russian involvement has emerged. he has also taken away clearances for all three democrats who ran against him in presidential contests biden, hillary clinton and kamala harris. trump has focused much of his attention on the criminal justice system after claiming during his 2024 presidential campaign that his four indictments were motivated by politics. then-president joe bidens administration denied the accusations. in trumps first 100 days, his justice department has fired or demoted dozens of officials, prosecutors and fbi agents, including rank-and-file employees who worked on investigations into trump and the january 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob of trump supporters. in a speech at the justice departments headquarters in february, trump denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him with illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. traditional presidencies have failed to bring meaningful change to the ways of washington, and the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy, a white house spokesman, harrison fields, said in response to questions about trumps retribution efforts and whether they represent an abuse of power. utilizing every tool afforded by the constitution, the trump administration is prioritizing efficiency eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and fulfilling every campaign promise. the ferocity and the scope during his first term, trumps instincts for revenge were sometimes thwarted by his own appointees, many of whom were experienced government hands or establishment republicans. by contrast, trump has filled his second-term administration with steadfast loyalists more likely to back his directives than caution against them. meanwhile, the republican majority in congress has shown little interest in opposing his actions. trump has taken steps as well to eliminate internal watchdogs who might seek to constrain him, purging inspectors general and firing government ethics officials. all administrations, particularly when you see a switch from one party to another, seek to control the executive branch, said historian timothy naftali, the former director of the richard nixon presidential library and museum. its the ferocity and the scope of what hes done that makes it unprecedented. the republican nixon famously had a list of enemies, but he plotted against them in secret. his most aggressive ideas, such as using the tax-collecting internal revenue service to audit his foes, were often blocked by his own officials. other presidents have used their power to penalize rivals in more muted ways, suri said. democrat lyndon johnson sought to discredit his political rival, robert kennedy, in the news media, and republican george w. bush banned brent scowcroft, a former national security adviser, from the white house after scowcroft wrote a column opposing the iraq war. thats often how presidents use their power to go after enemies they keep them out of their administration and spread rumors about them, suri said. trump has frequently intertwined his personal animus against political opponents with his administrations ideological and policy objectives. in february, trump digressed from remarks during a white house meeting with governors to address maine governor janet mills, warning her to comply with an order banning transgender athletes. see you in court, mills, a democrat, replied defiantly. within a day, three separate federal departments had initiated inquiries into whether the state was violating civil rights law, imperiling millions of dollars in federal funding. the justice department sent mills a letter telling her maine was on notice while trump demanded a full-throated apology before the case can be settled. in early april, trumps agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, wrote mills to confirm that some school funding had been frozen. this is only the beginning, rollins warned her. nine days later, the education department said it was taking steps to cut off all federal school funding to the state, and last week attorney general pam bondi announced the justice department had sued maine in federal court. in recent weeks, trump has attacked law firms that once employed attorneys he views as enemies, arguing they undermined the judicial process by doing so. in february, he suspended security clearances for attorneys at the law firm covington burling who had represented smith, the former special counsel investigating him, and sought to cancel any government work the firm had. making little effort to hide his primary motivation, trump suggested sending the pen he used to sign the order to smith as a souvenir. trump has signed executive orders targeting five other law firms, in each case indicating that revenge was an essential factor. his order punishing wilmerhale, for instance, noted that it once employed robert mueller, who investigated whether trumps 2016 campaign had improper connections with russia. nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work on mutually agreed projects backed by the administration. in some cases, trump simply appears determined to get even with former members of his 2017-2021 administration who irked him. this month, the president ordered the justice department to investigate christopher krebs, his former cybersecurity chief who disputed trumps false claims about election fraud in 2020, and miles taylor, a former homeland security official who anonymously wrote a 2019 book critical of trump. signing the executive order targeting the two former officials, trump called taylor a traitor. i think hes guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth, but well find out, he said. dissent isnt unlawful, taylor responded on x. it certainly isnt treasonous. reporting by

Current Article 3 (ID: 130366):
  Title: Challenge to ACA preventive-care panel draws skepticism from Supreme Court
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-21 19:59:15)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: This case can be interpreted through the lens of Separation of Powers doctrine. The article highlights the central question of whether the Preventive Services Task Force's members are 'principal officers' requiring presidential appointment and Senate approval, or 'inferior officers' who can be appointed by department heads. The text states, 'the constitutions appointment clause requires the president to appoint and get senate approval for principal officers...but allows congress to vest authority in department heads and other officials to appoint inferior officers.' This directly reflects the core concern of the Separation of Powers: preventing any one branch from accumulating excessive power. The debate over the task force's independence ('their coverage mandates are neither directed nor supervised by the secretary of health and human services') suggests a potential blurring of lines between the executive and legislative branches, as the task force's recommendations have significant policy implications. This raises concerns about accountability and the potential for unchecked power within the administrative state.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions the plaintiffs' objection to 'being forced to offer pre-exposure medications intended to prevent the spread of hiv among at-risk populations' because they believe 'the medications encourage and facilitate homosexual behavior.' This framing of HIV prevention as enabling 'homosexual behavior' is a noteworthy textual clue. Why does the article include this specific detail about the plaintiffs' beliefs? Could this inclusion be intended to subtly influence the reader's perception of the plaintiffs' motives, potentially framing them as discriminatory or biased, thereby undermining their legal arguments? What are the broader implications of allowing religious beliefs to dictate healthcare coverage decisions, particularly concerning public health initiatives?; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article focuses on the legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act, specifically the preventive care mandate. The fact that the Supreme Court is hearing this case, and the details of the arguments presented ('the justices sharply questioned an attorney for the challengers,' 'that argument seemed to resonate with some justices'), indicate that the issue is gaining prominence in the public discourse. The article also mentions previous unsuccessful attempts to overturn the ACA ('conservatives have tried unsuccessfully to overturn the law several times in recent years'). This repeated litigation, as reported in the media, keeps the ACA and its provisions on the public agenda, potentially influencing public opinion and future policy decisions. The framing of the issue – whether it's about religious freedom, executive power, or healthcare access – can further shape how the public perceives the ACA and its impact.; Intriguing_angles: The article states that 'the appeals court did not invalidate the task forces mandates universally but only as they applied to the plaintiffs.' This limited ruling is intriguing. Why did the appeals court choose to restrict the scope of its decision in this way? Could this suggest a strategic compromise, perhaps reflecting differing views among the judges or a desire to avoid a broader disruption of the healthcare system? What are the potential implications of this limited ruling for other individuals or organizations who may share similar objections to the preventive care mandates?

      > Snippet: since 2023, the health and human services secretary has made appointments to the 16-member preventive services task force.
    - Christian-owned business:
      > Snippet: a lawsuit brought by a christian-owned business and individuals argued that the mandates were unenforceable
  Content: the supreme court appeared skeptical monday of a challenge to a section of the affordable care act that requires health plans to provide no-cost preventive care such as cancer screenings, immunizations and contraception to millions of americans. a lawsuit brought by a christian-owned business and individuals argued that the mandates were unenforceable because members of the expert committee that decides what measures health plans must cover were improperly appointed. health-care providers and nonprofit organizations say the closely watched case could affect critical health services for many americans who might otherwise not have access to them. during oral argument monday, the justices sharply questioned an attorney for the challengers, who said the preventive services task force was unconstitutional because its members should have been appointed by the president and approved by the senate. the plaintiffs sued over the preventive-care provision because they objected to being forced to offer pre-exposure medications intended to prevent the spread of hiv among at-risk populations. the plaintiffs contend that the medications encourage and facilitate homosexual behavior, which they say conflicts with their religious beliefs. the constitutions appointment clause requires the president to appoint and get senate approval for principal officers such as cabinet secretaries, federal judges and ambassadors, but allows congress to vest authority in department heads and other officials to appoint inferior officers. since 2023, the health and human services secretary has made appointments to the 16-member preventive services task force. jonathan mitchell, an attorney for the challengers, argued that task force members were principal officers, drawing skepticism from justice brett m. kavanaugh and some of his colleagues. your theory, i think, depends on us treating the task force as this massively important agency that operates with unreviewable authority, kavanaugh said. normally, before that kind of thing would happen, congress would have provided stronger indications. hashim mooppan, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices that task force members are inferior officers since they can be fired at will by the secretary of the department of health and human services, who also has supervisory authority of the panel and decides when its recommendations take effect. they are subject to ample supervision by the secretary, mooppan said. mitchell keyed in on another section of the law that states that the task forces recommendations must be independent, to the extent practicable and free from political pressure, maintaining that this language indicates that task force members operate with the type of independence that requires senate confirmation. they cannot be inferior officers because their coverage mandates are neither directed nor supervised by the secretary of health and human services or by anyone else who has been appointed as a principal officer, mitchell said. that argument seemed to resonate with some justices. justice samuel a. alito jr., for example, questioned how much authority the hhs secretary really has over the task force. if the task force rates something a or b, then thats it, alito said. even if the members are removable at will, the only way you can get around that is through some really jerry-built arguments. a texas district court originally sided with the challengers, ruling that the task force was unconstitutional and that all mandates it had imposed since 201o were invalid. the government appealed, and the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit affirmed the district courts ruling with one major caveat. the appeals court did not invalidate the task forces mandates universally but only as they applied to the plaintiffs. both the plaintiffs and the government then asked the supreme court to take up the case, with the government saying the lower-court decisions could allow other plaintiffs to seek a nationwide ruling that would invalidate the preventive-care provision. nicholas bagley, an expert in administrative and health law at the university of michigan law school, said there appeared to be a small chance the justices might kick the case back to the 5th circuit to clear up one question whether congress had properly vested the hhs secretary with the ability to appoint task force members. there were at least some justices interested in remanding, bagley said. but it seems likely the government will emerge with a partial victory, if not more than that. the case is just the latest to put the affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare, in the legal crosshairs. conservatives have tried unsuccessfully to overturn the law several times in recent years. in a landmark ruling in 2012, the supreme court upheld its legality.

  Title: Fake Alpine Quest Mapping App Spotted Spying on Russian Military
  Source: hackread.com (2025-04-22 21:26:10)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Realism, the article highlights the ongoing competition between states (or state-affiliated actors) in the cyber domain. The targeting of Russian military personnel through a compromised app, as evidenced by "fake alpine quest app laced with spyware was used to target russian military android devices, stealing location data, contacts, and sensitive files," demonstrates a pursuit of strategic advantage through intelligence gathering. This suggests a constant state of low-intensity conflict where information is a valuable resource.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that "at the time of writing, the group behind the campaign has not been identified, and it remains unclear whether this operation is domestic or foreign in origin." This lack of immediate attribution, despite similarities to past Ukrainian hacktivist activities, raises questions about the complexity of cyber warfare. Could this ambiguity be intentional, designed to obscure the true source and avoid direct repercussions?

  Content: fake alpine quest app laced with spyware was used to target russian military android devices, stealing location data, contacts, and sensitive files. a malicious version of alpine quest, a popular android navigation app, has been found carrying spyware aimed at russian military personnel. security researchers at doctor web uncovered the modified software embedded with android.spy.1292.origin spyware capable of harvesting data and extending its functionality through remote commands. alpine quest is commonly used by outdoor enthusiasts, but its also relied on by soldiers in russias military zones due to its offline mapping features. that made it a convenient cover for attackers, who repackaged an older version of the app and pushed it as a free download through a fake telegram channel. the link led to an app store targeting russian users, where the infected software was listed as a pro version of the app. once installed, the spyware collects all sorts of information. each time the app is opened, it sends the users phone number, account details, contacts, geolocation, and a list of files stored on the device to a remote server. some of this data is also sent to a telegram bot controlled by the attackers, including updated location details every time the user moves. left telegram channel promoting the malicious alpine quest app in russian via dr. web right english translation of the image using yandex ai, via hackread.com. doctor webs analysis shows that this spyware is capable of more than passive tracking. after identifying which files are available, the malware can be instructed to download new modules designed to extract specific content. based on its behaviour, the attackers appear especially interested in documents shared through messaging apps like telegram and whatsapp. it also seeks out a file called loclog, created by alpine quest itself, which logs user movements in detail. because the spyware is bundled with a working version of the app, it looks and functions normally, giving it time to operate unnoticed. its modular design also means its capabilities can grow over time, depending on the attackers goals. doctor web advises users to avoid downloading apps from unofficial sources, even when they appear to offer free access to paid features. even on official app stores, its best to avoid installing apps you dont truly need. malicious apps have been known to slip past review processes on both google play and the app store. at the time of writing, the group behind the campaign has not been identified, and it remains unclear whether this operation is domestic or foreign in origin. however, similar operations in the past have been linked to ukrainian hacktivist groups, including cyber resistance, also known as the ukrainian cyber alliance. in 2023, they reportedly targeted spouses of russian military personnel, extracting sensitive and personal data. however, there is still no confirmed attribution for the group behind this spyware campaign.

  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism is relevant here. The article illustrates how a shift in the U.S. administration's policies and rhetoric, specifically "steep trade tariffs" and "suggestions that canada should become a u.s. state," directly impacts Canada's economic and social well-being. This aligns with Realism's emphasis on states acting in their self-interest and the pursuit of power, leading to a competitive and sometimes conflictual international environment. The resulting "chill that has blanketed relations" and the economic consequences for both countries demonstrate the core tenets of Realist thought.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that some Canadians are "quietly preparing to let go of their second homes" but "holding back to see how things play out." This suggests a level of uncertainty and a potential for further shifts in behavior depending on future political developments. What specific political or economic indicators are these Canadians monitoring, and what threshold would trigger a more widespread exodus?; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the economic reliance of South Florida on Canadian snowbirds, stating they "either own property and pay property tax or rent for the winter months - either way, a boost to the economy." However, it doesn't quantify the overall economic impact or explore potential mitigation strategies. What percentage of South Florida's economy is directly attributable to Canadian snowbirds, and what alternative revenue streams are being considered to offset the potential loss?

      > Snippet: canadians spent close to 6 billion on u.s. real estate from april 2023 to march 2024 - making up 13 of all foreign transactions - more than any other nationality
  Content: by doyinsola oladipo and mrinalika roy reuters -the number of canadian snowbirds planning to sell their second homes in sunny florida and arizona has surged this spring, many of them put off by the sudden chill that has blanketed relations between their homeland and the u.s. real estate agents say they are seeing more canadians cashing out, further softening property prices in warm-weather states that have long attracted retirees and tourists from cold and snowy canada. canadians spent close to 6 billion on u.s. real estate from april 2023 to march 2024 - making up 13 of all foreign transactions - more than any other nationality, according to data from the national association of realtors. nearly half of the homes purchased by canadians were for vacation purposes, with florida, arizona and hawaii ranking as the top markets. last week, tracy and dale mcmullen sold their vacation home in buckeye, arizona, a property they owned for five years. the alberta residents, who usually spend four to five months in arizona a year, said they are not planning to come back. we decided to sell the property after the current potus took office, said dale, referring to u.s. president donald trump, who was inaugurated for the second time in january. it was time to leave. we felt we could not trust what he might do next to us as individuals and to our country. we no longer felt welcome nor safe. canadians are feeling stung by the actions and words of the trump administration, which has imposed steep trade tariffs on its northern neighbor, threatening canadas export-dependent economy. trumps repeated suggestions that canada should become a u.s. state, and his derogatory references to now-former prime minister justin trudeau as governor have annoyed canadians and offended their national pride. as a result, many canadians are boycotting u.s.-made goods, such as bourbon and produce and canceling trips to u.s. destinations. canadian return flights from the u.s. fell 13.5 in march from a year earlier, according to statistics canada. canadian-resident return trips by automobile fell about 32. real estate is now facing a similar pullback in demand. laurie lavine, a realtor in arizona who helped the mcmullens with their sale, told reuters that he currently has 18 listings from canadians looking to sell, compared with the usual two to four per quarter. trade friction and the current weakness of the canadian dollar are also contributing to the pullback, lavine said. canadians are also feeling picked on, with u.s. border agents enforcing stricter rules on entering the country, he added. beginning this month, the trump administration is requiring all foreigners 14 or older to register and submit fingerprints if they stay beyond 30 days. canadians, who previously could visit for up to six months without a visa, are subject to the new requirement. the sour feelings that many canadians suddenly feel toward the u.s. are having a big impact on the property market in florida, one of the closest warm-weather states to ontario and quebec, canadas most populous provinces. south floridas residential market has for decades been reliant on the annual influx of canadian snowbirds who either own property and pay property tax or rent for the winter months - either way, a boost to the economy, said ermengarde jabir, a director of economic research at moodys analytics. the first quarter is typically the peak buying season for condominiums in the region, coinciding with when many snowbirds are in town, said andrea hartmann, managing partner of the sandy hartmann group, a real estate firm in the tampa bay area. since the beginning of the year we have not received an offer from a canadian buyer even once, and normally we would, she said. floridas housing market is already reeling. prospective buyers have faced rising insurance premiums, concerns over climate change and a series of devastating hurricanes in recent years. in the tampa-st. petersburg-clearwater region, mortgage lock volume for second homes - or the number of buyers securing rates ahead of purchases - fell 25 on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2025, according to optimal blue, a mortgage technology and data company. now with the political issue, the cost of maintaining a place here in florida and the insurance, a lot of them decided to sell and go, said ken obrian, owner of southwest coast realty in naples, which has specialized in helping canadians purchase properties in florida for about 20 years. there is no incentive to come to the states anymore, said donny b., a native of ontario who is looking to sell his two investment properties in florida. like many snowbirds interviewed for this story, he declined to give his surname, saying he feared backlash. he said he decided to sell because of the political uncertainty, the exchange rate and concern about whether floridians would still welcome canadians in the current climate. i got down here on wednesday and i was nervous. im like, are people going to be pissed off at me? other states have started to see an exodus as well. agents in los angeles and palm springs, california, are working with canadian sellers who are quietly preparing to let go of their second homes, said fatima malik, global real estate advisor at engel volkers beverly hills. some are holding back to see how things play out, but others are already shifting their sights toward places like portugal, mexico, and parts of france, she added. reporting by doyinsola oladipo in new york and mrinalika roy in bengaluru editing by frank mcgurty and paul simao

  Title: Dodgers collaborate with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami on merchandise again. Here's how to get it
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 11:00:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article highlights how the collaboration between Takashi Murakami and the Dodgers, along with the MLB Tokyo Series, successfully captured public attention. The text states, "the overall success of the tokyo series collection delighted murakami" and "i was surprised by the overwhelming response." This suggests that the media coverage and marketing efforts surrounding the event effectively placed it on the public's agenda, leading to increased interest and demand.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions the merchandise hitting the secondary market for four times the purchase price. This suggests a potential imbalance between supply and demand, and raises the question: Was the limited availability of the merchandise intentional to drive up prices and create hype, and if so, what are the ethical implications of such a strategy?; Intriguing_angles: The article notes Murakami's surprise at the overwhelming response in Japan, stating, "honestly, i had thought baseball wasnt as major a sport in japan these days." This suggests a potential disconnect between the artist's perception and the reality of baseball's popularity in Japan. What other assumptions might be influencing the collaboration, and how might these assumptions affect its long-term success?

  Content: a month ago, dodgers gear festooned with colorful flowers in the unmistakable designs of acclaimed japanese artist takashi murakami sold out in minutes at a pop-up on fairfax avenue. a couple hundred angelenos lined up overnight to purchase gear, generating 40 million. the pop-up, called the mlb tokyo series collection, preceded the two-game, season-opening series in japan between the dodgers and chicago cubs, and items soon hit the secondary market for four times the purchase price. the merchandise was so popular that murakami and the dodgers responded by approximating the famous words of hall of fame cubs shortstop ernie banks lets play two! a new collection presented by complex and fanatics will be available april 28 during japanese heritage night at dodger stadium and the dodger clubhouse store, then can be purchased only online. murakami, 63, will throw out the ceremonial first pitch as he did before an exhibition between the dodgers and yomiuri giants at the tokyo dome on march 15. its been two months since i started practicing for the first pitch in tokyo, but given my age, its not so easy to pick up new skills, murakami said playfully in an interview with the times. still, compared to the first day when i couldnt throw the ball at all, ive improved significantly. my hope this time is to throw the ball without it bouncing. some of the dodgers merchandise created in collaboration with japanese artist takashi murakami is shown. complex murakami is unquestionably adept with a brush, a pen or a computer, creating iconic art that features manga, anime, cartoons and brightly colored anthropomorphic cherry blossoms, mushrooms and assorted flowers. he began delivering commissioned projects for luxury brands and celebrities 20 years ago, and a financial pinnacle came in 2008 when his provocative life-size figure my lonesome cowboy sold for 15.1 million at auction. since then murakami has integrated his art on louis vuitton handbags, a kanye west album cover, and the kid cudi collaboration kids see ghosts. he also had a solo exhibition in 2022 at the broad titled takashi murakami stepping on the tail of a rainbow that included sculpture, painting, wallpaper and immersive installations. now his attention has turned to baseball. the mlb tokyo series collection had his familiar colorful flora sprinkled across jerseys, bats, balls, hoodies, flip-flops and a shohei ohtani bobblehead. the surprise medium might have been collaborating with topps on baseball cards. since 2023, i have been creating trading cards and trading card games with my team, so i felt i approached this project with a good understanding of the context, murakami said. but when we filmed the unboxing event for the topps complex series and tokyo series on youtube, i recognized anew how profound the world of american sports trading cards is, which shook me with excitement. the overall success of the tokyo series collection delighted murakami, who said he remembers playing catch with his father as a child. honestly, i had thought baseball wasnt as major a sport in japan these days, so i was surprised by the overwhelming response, he said. i received messages from childhood friends and was approached by neighbors afterwards, which made me realize that baseball remains the beloved sport among the japanese public. the addition of japanese megastars ohtani, yoshinobu yamamoto and roki sasaki made collaborating with the dodgers a natural. the teams popularity in japan has never been greater. the dodgers are the team hideo nomo joined when he first played major league baseball, overcoming various obstacles, murakami said. his success had a significant impact on japanese players entering the majors, and his achievements are vivid in my memory. shohei ohtani joining the dodgers feels like a fateful story for japanese baseball, and im deeply moved by it. in that sense, i consider myself a dodgers fan. murakami added that he has felt comfortable in l.a. since his exhibition at the museum of contemporary art in 2007-2008. i believe my career as an artist in the contemporary art world took off in los angeles, he said. the moca exhibition, curated by paul schimmel, was pivotal in establishing my career in america. whenever i visit los angeles, i feel a strong connection, as if its my second hometown, with fans saying hello to me around the city. so im especially grateful for this new relationship with the dodgers in los angeles.

  Title: Ukraine-Russia war latest: Trump exempts Russia from tariffs amid visit by Putin’s top negotiator

ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. donald trump has not included russia on its expansive list of countries that will face major new tariffs starting today as vladimir putins top negotiator held meetings in washington. at the same time, war-hit ukraine is facing 10 per cent tariffs from the us administration. the white house has not explained why russia will not face tariffs. mr putins investment envoy and one of the most us-savvy members of russias elite, kirill dmitriev, met with us officials in washington yesterday. the highest-ranking russian official to visit the us since the invasion in february 2022, he is visiting on invitation from mr trumps middle east envoy steve witkoff. his visit comes at a time when the trump administration continues to press russia and ukraine to agree to a ceasefire. as he unveiled his tariffs on wednesday, mr trump hailed good cooperation between russia and ukraine as he underlined his desire to stop the war. natos assets could be key in aiding proposed european military mission to guarantee a peace deal in ukraine in plans being worked out by the war-hit nations western allies. in one of the proposals being discussed by the uk and france, natos command and control structures would be used in a deployment of a so-called reassurance force in ukraine, five officials aware of the plan told the financial times. the reassurance force would also use natos shared intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, under the proposal, ft reported. this proposal is one of the several options being discussed by european allies and could be changed before any final agreement, according to the officials aware of the plan. mark your calendars for 8am on 4 april as the independent launches the conversation, a new series where our top journalists sit down with world-leading experts to dissect the biggest issues shaping our times. in the premier episode, world affairs editor sam kiley is joined by alex younger, the former chief of mi6, britains secret intelligence service, and leading security strategist rachel ellehuus, director-general of the royal united services institute rusi and former pentagon official with expertise in nato and transatlantic defence. russian forces unleashed an hour-long barrage of drones on kharkiv, ukraines second city, late last night, triggering a number of fires but causing no casualties in the second such attack in the course of the day, the regional governor said. in the space of just one hour, the enemy deployed 17 iranian-designed shahed drones, said governor oleh syniehubov. most of the strikes were in the kyiv district. local fires broke out. fortunately, there were no casualties, he said. the same district had come under attack earlier in the day, with officials reporting five people injured. a team from ukraine may be coming to the united states as soon as this week or next week, us treasury secretary scott bessent told bloomberg television yesterday, amid efforts to end the war with russia. last week, the top us official had said ukraine may sign an economic deal this week. we have passed along a completed document for the economic partnership that is currently being reviewed by ukrainians, and we hope to go to full discussions and perhaps even get signatures next week, mr bessent had said. the trump administration has not included russia on its expansive list of countries that will face major new tariffs. the white house has not explained why russia will not face tariffs. president donald trump announced plans for sweeping tariffs last night, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. ukraine was slapped with a 10 per cent levy, according to a fact sheet released by the white house. this comes as vladimir putins investment envoy kirill dmitriev met with us officials in washington yesterday as the trump administration continues to press russia and ukraine to agree to a ceasefire, two us officials familiar with the matter said. at least 11 more ukrainian children have been brought home from parts of russia and russian-occupied ukraine where they had been taken without permission, volodymyr zelenskys chief of staff said yesterday. today we have one more piece of good news, andriy yermak, the chief of staff, wrote on his telegram channel. within the framework of the president of ukraines bring kids back ua initiative, another 11 ukrainian children were brought back from temporarily occupied areas of ukraine and the territory of the russian federation, he said. among the children, mr yermak said, were brothers aged 10 and 12 whose father died after being tortured for expressing pro-ukrainian views. also brought home, mr yermak wrote, was a pregnant mother who had been prevented from leaving occupied ukraine because she had refused to take out russian identity papers, and her two-year-old toddler. the mother gave birth to another child in ukrainian-held territory. mr yermak thanked the office of ukraines ombudsman for its help in arranging the return of the children. russia has not issued a statement on returning ukrainian citizens. half of the us senate, including 25 republicans and 25 democrats, banded together to introduce prospective sanctions on russia which would be imposed if it refuses to engage in good faith negotiations with ukraine. led by republican senator lindsey graham and democratic senator richard blumenthal, the group said it would impose primary and secondary sanctions against russia if moscow does not engage in talks or initiated another attempt to undermine ukraines sovereignty. the sanctions against russia require tariffs on countries who purchase russian oil, gas, uranium and other products. they are hard hitting for a reason, the two senators said in a statement, a rare moment of bipartisanship in a divided congress. the dominating view in the united states senate is that russia is the aggressor, and that this horrific war and putins aggression must end now and be deterred in the future, they said. donald trump has hailed good cooperation between russia and ukraine as he underlined his desire to stop the war. speaking from the white house as he announced tariffs on us imports of goods from around the world, mr trump said were going to get it stopped. he added its a senseless war that would have never happened if i was president and it shouldnt be allowed to go on. and i think weve been given good cooperation by russia and by ukraine, but we have to get it stopped. its humanity. its humanity. its a terrible thing. a us visit by vladimir putins envoy kirill dmitriev is possible, the kremlin said on wednesday. contacts between moscow and washington are continuing, a kremlin spokesperson added. reuters reported that dmitriev is expected in washington this week for talks with donald trumps administration. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Trump's agenda grapples with political and economic reality - BBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-05 00:02:40)
  Content: donald trump, in announcing his sweeping new tariffs on us imports on wednesday, promised that the history books would record 2 april as americas liberation day. after two days of stock market turmoil, however, this may also be remembered as the week the presidents second-term agenda ran headfirst into economic - and political - reality. us stocks have been in a tailspin since trump unveiled his tariffs at wednesday afternoons white house rose garden event, with signs that americas trading partners - canada, the european union and china, most notably - are not backing away from a fight. meanwhile, other presidential efforts, on foreign policy and immigration, and at the ballot box - have faced notable setbacks in recent days. the white house on thursday felt a bit like a building battening down for a coming storm. the four big posters showing americas reciprocal tariffs on a long list of countries were on prominent display in the press briefing room, but administration officials available to respond to media questions were few and far between. out on pennsylvania avenue, workers unloaded pallets of metal fencing, which will ring the white house grounds in preparation for what officials anticipate to be a large anti-trump demonstration at the nearby washington monument on saturday. the first lady announced that a white house garden tour event that had been scheduled for that day was postponed because of security concerns. even the normally loquacious president stopped only briefly to talk with the crush of reporters on his way to board the marine one helicopter on the first leg of his journey to florida. i said this would be exactly the way it is, he declared when asked about the days stock market turmoil. the markets - and america as a whole - would soon boom, he said. the president, it seems, is willing to wait out the tempest created by his tariff plan. he appears confident that his economic vision of a rebuilt, job-rich american manufacturing sector protected from foreign competition - a vision he has closely held for decades - will ultimately be proven right. the trump agendas close encounter with cold, hard reality wasnt limited to trade this week, however. his two top foreign policy priorities - ending the wars in gaza and ukraine - both appear mired in the kind of messy details and conflicting agendas that often obstruct lasting peace. israel has once again moved into gaza and escalated a bombing campaign that is generating reports of widespread civilian casualties. the ceasefire that trump touted in the days before he took office appears to be in tatters. russia, meanwhile, continues to pile new conditions on to negotiations for a full ceasefire with ukraine, which is an indication that the nation may be buying time to allow its ground forces to take more territory. if i think theyre tapping us along, i will not be happy about it, trump said of russia. but he added that he still believes president vladimir putin wants to make a deal. evidence so far indicates the contrary, according to jake sullivan, who was president joe bidens national security adviser. in an interview with the bbc, he accused trump of handing russia most of its demands, though he acknowledged it was still early in the process and things could yet change. so the current dynamic in these negotiations a is not in fact producing russian willingness to reach a fair and just compromise, but b is actually stimulating a view in moscow that if they just keep holding out, theyre just going to keep getting concessions from the united states. and so far that is what has happened. even trumps deportation and immigration enforcement efforts, which still have high public support, have been at least partially derailed by legal challenges. while his administration has successfully completed several flights transferring alleged tren de aragua venezuelan gang members to an el salvadoran high-security prison, the judge presiding over a case challenging those deportations said on thursday there was a fair likelihood officials had violated his court order to turn the flights around. other court challenges - to trumps suspension of political asylum processing and refugee resettlement, his attempt to end birthright citizenship and his revocation of temporary protected status for about 350,000 venezuelans - are currently working their way through the us legal system. at some point, the us supreme court is expected to weigh in on many of these disputes. this week also marked the biggest round of elections since trumps november 2024 victory, as voters headed to the polls in wisconsin to elect a state judge and in two florida special elections for seats in the house of representatives. while the republican candidates in florida prevailed, their winning margins were about 15, which is about half of what trump posted in those congressional districts in november. in wisconsin, a key political battleground state, the democratic-backed candidate won. democrats were able to maintain the liberal majority on the court despite the tens of millions of dollars spent by conservative groups, including by tech billionaire elon musk, who campaigned there in person. taken as a whole the results suggest that democrats are doing well in hotly contested races and may be making inroads even in reliably conservative areas - in part by campaigning against musk and his efforts to massively cut federal programmes and staff. that could be an indication that the party will have the political wind at their backs in state elections this november and the midterm congressional elections next year. the stock market tumult, and those ballot-box results, may be behind a few scattered signs of dissent within republican ranks. ted cruz, an arch-conservative senator from texas, said on his podcast on friday that trumps tariffs could hurt jobs and could hurt america - particularly if other nations retaliate, as china has already done. if were in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now, with massive american tariffs, and massive tariffs on american goods in every other country on earth, that is a terrible outcome, he continued. on wednesday night in the us senate, four republicans joined with democrats to support rescinding the emergency declaration that justifies trumps earlier canada tariffs. and on thursday, republican senator chuck grassley of iowa joined with democrat maria cantwell of washington to back a measure that would require congress to directly approve tariffs that stay in effect longer than 60 days. republicans by and large have been sticking with the president. they seem unwilling, or unable, to sway trump from his current course on tariffs and government cuts and appear fearful of the political consequences of breaking with the man who has a vise-like grip on the party. but if the current economic shock becomes a long-term hardship, and if government programme cuts translate into tangible disruptions in popular services or if trumps standing in opinion polls continues to sag, members of his own party may begin eyeing the exit signs for the first time in years. and that would bring an unceremonious end to some of trumps most ambitious efforts. trump, no longer worried about standing before voters, may feel liberated from the immediate political consequences of his actions - but reality has a way of asserting itself in the end.

  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism is relevant here. Germany's veto of the Eurofighter sale to Turkey, after the jailing of Istanbul's mayor, and Turkey's subsequent assertion that its national interests supersede individual politicians ('turkeys national interests are more valuable than erdoğan or imamoğlu') exemplifies the realist emphasis on national interest and power politics in international relations. This suggests that despite potential ideological differences or human rights concerns, states prioritize their strategic and economic goals.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents a series of seemingly disparate events, linked only by their occurrence on specific dates. This juxtaposition, without explicit commentary, creates a sense of chaotic simultaneity. What underlying connections, if any, might exist between these events, and what effect does this fragmented presentation have on the reader's overall understanding?

  Title: Opinion: This isn’t immigration enforcement. It’s political theater. - The Salt Lake Tribune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-10 12:01:24)
  Content: federal law enforcement under president trump is engaged in dangerous political theater, with high-profile arrests of non-citizen students, workers and parents set up to score political points more than to protect national security. it is not impossible for the united states to have a humane immigration system focused on public safety that provides for the growth of the nation and local communities. ive seen those possibilities through my work in military intelligence, counterterrorism, homeland defense and cyberoperations and as the chief of staff at u.s. immigration customs and enforcement during the biden administration. border security and interior immigration are linked but separate challenges. in towns within the united states, there is an effective way to do interior immigration enforcement and protect our national security without undue emphasis on undocumented immigrants who do not have criminal convictions. right now, the government is burning thousands of federal law enforcement hours on operations that privilege political objectives over public safety, attacking constitutional protections like due process and free speech as they do. if this administration doesnt correct course, it will lock the country into a future of weaker enforcement, lowered trust in public safety officials and greater risk to americans collective safety. this is not the first administration to fail at this task. president barack obama leaned on broken enforcement policies, using deportation as a deterrent while unsuccessfully trying to reform the broader immigration enterprise. president trumps first administration implemented zero-tolerance policies that separated families, sought to end protections for children who arrived in this country as minors, prioritized draconian deterrence measures and relied on emergency public health restrictions, like title 42. the biden white house then continued to use emergency public health restrictions as a crutch to address a problem that needed a much more expansive solution. as each successive administration relied more on executive power to manage the system, congress did not pass structured, long-term immigration reform. but this moment is worse. the new trump white house is finding ever more cruel, even brutal, methods to publicly target some of the most vulnerable people in this country. while americans are distracted by sensational videos of anti-migrant enforcement actions from the trump administration on social media, the real threats grow. the homeland security secretary, kristi noem, recently announced that federal agents arrested roughly 20,000 undocumented people across the country in february. that doesnt mean 20,000 national security threats were removed from the united states. on average, the united states can deport only about 7,000 to 9,000 people monthly by plane, and detention centers were at maximum capacity. so what happened to the 13,000 other migrants who were arrested? the only rational law enforcement step would be to process and then release them. that means law enforcements time, energy and focus were wasted on a political stunt. and real people suffered. every ice agent dispatched to detain a noncriminal farmworker, construction laborer or college student many, if not most, of whom have legal standing to work and study in our communities is an ice agent not investigating fentanyl networks, cyberattacks, human trafficking or transnational gangs. those are the actual bad actors who threaten american safety and sovereignty. last month, the department of homeland security removed a maryland father to el salvador that it had no ground to deport, and despite well-documented threats against his life from local gangs. ice arrested and continues to hold in detention a tufts university student with no criminal record another case that lacks any public safety rationale. these cases send a message that law enforcement is a prop, not a protector. the machinery of federal law enforcement is powerful. thats what makes it so dangerous when misused by political opportunists. ice and u.s. customs and border protection have greater authority than most americans realize. they can detain people without a warrant, conduct searches without probable cause and deport people without criminal charges. these powers demand discipline, not spectacle. they exist to respond urgently to serious threats, prevent cross-border crime and detain individuals who pose risks when time or circumstances dont allow for traditional criminal justice processes. they do not exist to target migrant grandmothers from guatemala, unaccompanied children fleeing gang violence, haitian families seeking asylum from political collapse, palestinian and indian students who attended u.s. universities under lawful visas, or mexican and salvadoran families working and raising u.s. citizen children while trapped in immigration backlogs. over the past two decades, the united states has invested heavily in a sophisticated vetting infrastructure. it can flag threats based on identities, travel histories and behavioral patterns. its built to catch real bad actors before they can do harm. but instead of using its tools to protect children from abuse or disrupt transnational money laundering operations, they are being used to track down individuals with no criminal convictions, people who are providing our nation the benefits of their hope and hard work. when ice and c.b.p. are used in this manner, their mission is compromised. career agents are sidelined. morale drops. recruitment suffers. when communities see federal law enforcement used to punish rather than to protect, they stop cooperating. law enforcement loses tips, and witnesses. local partners hesitate to share information. thats how dangerous actors slip through. the real bad actors are getting smarter and faster. mexican cartels use tunnels and ultralight aircraft to move narcotics. cybercriminals attack hospitals and rural infrastructure. international smuggling operations launder profits through cryptocurrency. that means the best solution for public safety is not mass deportations its giving undocumented immigrants who have been in the united states for a long time the opportunity to come forward, pay a fine and gain legal status. this country needs law enforcement that goes after genuine threats, not just easy targets, and immigration enforcement that reflects who we are a nation built by immigrants and secured by law. law enforcement agents know how to do it. they built the tools. but if the current administration keeps misusing them, the people who intend to harm us will succeed. jason p. houser is a former ice chief of staff, department of homeland security counterterrorism official, afghanistan combat veteran, and u.s. cyber command liaison to israel and europe. this article originally appeared in the new york times. get the latest news by subscribing to our top stories newsletter. enter your email below to receive more stories like these right to your inbox.

      > Snippet: kevin hassett, director of the white house economic council, told abc.
  Content: atlanta ap trump administration officials were out in force across the television networks sunday defending president donald trumps economic policies after another week of reeling markets that saw the republican administration reverse course on some of its steepest tariffs. trump, meanwhile, said on his social media platform that there ultimately will be no exemptions for his sweeping tariff agenda, disputing characterizations that he has granted tariff exceptions for certain electronics, including smart phones, whose production is concentrated in china. rather, trump said, those products are subject to the existing 20 fentanyl tariffs, and they are just moving to a different tariff bucket. white house advisers and cabinet members tried to project confidence and calm amid trumps on-again, off-again approach to tariffs on imported goods from around the world. but their explanations about the overall agenda, coupled with trumps latest statements, also reflected shifting narratives from a president who, as a candidate in 2024, promised an immediate economic boost and lower prices but now asks american businesses and consumers for patience. a week ago, trumps team stood by his promise to leave the impending tariffs in place without exceptions. they used their latest news show appearances to defend his move to ratchet back to a 10 universal tariff for most nations except china 145, while seeming to grant exemptions for certain electronics like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and semiconductor chips. here are the highlights of what trump lieutenants said last week vs. sunday there are varying answers on the purpose of the tariffs long before launching his first presidential campaign in 2015, trump bemoaned the offshoring of u.s. manufacturing. his promise is to reindustrialize the united states and eliminate trade deficits with other countries. last week commerce secretary howard lutnick, interviewed on cbs face the nation, played up national security. youve got to realize this is a national security issue, he said, raising the worst-case scenarios of what could happen if the u.s. were involved in a war. we dont make medicine in this country anymore. we dont make ships. we dont have enough steel and aluminum to fight a battle, right? he said. sunday lutnick stuck to that national security framing, but white house trade adviser peter navarro focused more on the import taxes being leverage in the bigger economic puzzle. the world cheats us. theyve been cheating us for decades, navarro said on nbcs meet the press. he cited practices such as dumping products at unfairly low prices, currency manipulation and barriers to u.s. auto and agricultural products entering foreign markets. navarro insisted the tariffs would yield broader bilateral trade deals to address all those issues. but he also relied on a separate justification when discussing china the illicit drug trade. china has killed over a million people with their fentanyl, he said. speaking before trumps truth social post disputing the notion of exemptions, lutnick alluded to that coming policy. theyre going to have a special focus-type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored, he told abcs this week. the status of negotiations with other nations, including china, remains fuzzy last week with the higher rates set to be collected beginning april 9, administration officials argued that other countries would rush to the negotiating table. ive heard that there are negotiations ongoing and that there are a number of offers, kevin hassett, director of the white house economic council, told abc. he claimed that more than 50 countries were reaching out, though he did not name any. sunday navarro named the united kingdom, the european union, india, japan, south korea, indonesia and israel as among the nations in active negotiations with u.s. trade representative jamieson greer, lutnick and other officials. greer said on cbs that his goal was to get meaningful deals before 90 days - the duration of trumps pause - and i think were going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks. talks with china have not begun, he said. we expect to have a conversation with them, he said, emphasizing it would be between trump and chinese president xi jinping. trump took an aggressive tone himself sunday in his social media post, saying we will not be held hostage by other countries, especially hostile trading nations like china, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the american people. navarro was not as specific about beijing. we have opened up our invitation to them, he said. lutnick characterized the outreach as soft entrees through intermediaries. pressed on whether there is any meaningful back and forth, navarro said, the president has a very good relationship with president xi. then he proceeded to criticize several chinas polices and trade practices. the pitches are different, but confidence is constant last week navarro was bullish even after u.s. and global trading markets suffered trillions of dollars in losses. the first rule, particularly for the smaller investors out there, you cant lose money unless you sell. and, right now, the smart strategy is not to panic, he said on fox news channels sunday morning futures. sunday navarros optimism did not waver despite another net-loss week for securities markets and rocky bond markets. so, this is unfolding exactly like we thought it would in a dominant scenario, he said. others confronted some of the more complex realities of trying to achieve trumps goal of restoring a bygone era of u.s. manufacturing. lutnick suggested the focus is on returning high-tech jobs, while sidestepping questions about lower-skilled manufacturing of goods such as shoes that could mean higher prices because of higher wages for u.s. workers. but some of that high-tech production is what trump has, for now, exempted from the tariffs that he and his advisers frame as leverage for forcing companies to open u.s. facilities. hassett did acknowledge widespread angst. the survey data has been showing that people are anxious about the changes a little bit, he said, before steering his answer to employment rates. the hard data, he said, has been really, really strong.

or she could dig her heels in and unleash an almighty blitzkrieg, castigating the french justice system with one hand and bringing down the government with the other. both options come with risks. bardella is still seen as green profile here. and so far, the french public seem pretty comfortable with mondays court ruling. an odoxa poll for le figaro published monday evening found that 54 percent of 995 respondents said they believed her sentence was a sign that france had a healthy democracy. another 65 percent said they were satisfied or indifferent to the verdict, victor goury-laffont reports. liberal unease yet even among liberal democrats, there was a sense of unease. sure, this is an affirmation of the rule of law le pen was convicted of misusing european parliament funds for campaign activities, after all. but its not a popular rejection by the demo. germanys spending push drives up borrowing costs across eurozone financial times welcome to britain, where critical whatsapp messages are a police matter reclaim the net the rise of the gurus sam freedman rachel reeves is a helpless pawn in donald trumps tariff war telegraph israel v. the resistance netanyahu cancels appointment of new shin bet head amid opposition from allies times of israel the first responders massacre 14 aid workers found dead and buried, hands bound mondoweiss guurst us blames hamas for israeli execution of palestinian medics antiwar.com kevin w. lordie. three killed in israeli strike targeting hezbollah militant in beirut arab news iran will target britains chagos base if trump attacks telegraph. the media and some readers argued that iran might not be able to reach diego garcia. iran is signaling otherwise. racist allied underestimation of russias abilities led to its win moon of alabama kevin w trump-putin parley is a bit under the weather indian punchline kevin w europe prepares itself for all-out war with russia ian proud germany decides to leave history in the past and prepare for war bbc trumps negotiators fail to understand russia and europe crashes and burns larry johnson big brother is watching you watch open source genetic database shuts down to protect users from authoritarian governments 404media. help me. the fact that police are the main users is a surprise?

bessent said. what we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity. trumps tariff blitz, announced april 2, fulfilled a key campaign promise as he acted without congress to redraw the rules of global trade. it was a move decades in the making for trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the u.s. he is gambling that voters will be willing to endure higher prices for everyday items to enact his economic vision. countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with china and others retaliating quickly. top white house economic adviser kevin hassett acknowledged that other countries are angry and retaliating, and, he said, by the way, coming to the table. he cited the office of the u.s. trade representative as reporting that more than 50 nations had reached out to the white house to begin talks. adding to the turmoil, the new tariffs are hitting american allies and adversaries alike, including israel, which is facing a 17 tariff. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is set to visit the white house monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion with trump along with the war in gaza and other issues. another american ally, vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs. trump said vietnams leader said in a telephone call that his country wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s. and a key european partner, italian premier giorgia meloni, said she disagreed with trumps move but was ready to deploy all the tools negotiating and economic necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized. commerce secretary howard lutnick made clear there was no postponing tariffs that are days away. the tariffs are coming. of course they, he said, adding that trump needed to reset global trade. but he committed only to having them definitely remain for days and weeks. in congress, where trumps republican party has long championed free trade, the tariff regiment has been met with applause but also significant unease. several republican senators have already signed onto a new bipartisan bill that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to congress. lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. wyomings john barrasso, the no. 2 member of the senates gop leadership, said trump is doing what he has every right to do. but, he acknowledged, there is concern, and theres concern across the country. people are watching the markets. therell be a discussion in the senate, barrasso said of the tariffs. well see which way the discussion goes. trumps government cost-cutting guru, billionaire businessman elon musk, had been relatively silent on trumps tariffs, but said at a weekend event in italy that he would like to see the u.s. and europe move to a zero-tariff situation. the comment from the tesla owner who leads trumps department of government efficiency drew a rebuke from white house trade adviser peter navarro. elon, when he is on his doge lane, is great. but we understand whats going on here. we just have to understand. elon sells cars, navarro said. he added hes simply protecting his own interest as any business person would do. lawrence summers, an economist who was treasury secretary under democratic president bill clinton, said trump and his economic team are sending contradictory messages if they say they are interested in reviving manufacturing while still being open to negotiating with trade partners. if other countries eliminate their tariffs, and the u.s, does, too, he said, its just making a deal, then we dont raise any revenue nor do we get any businesses to relocate to the united states. if its a permanent revenue source and trying to get businesses to relocate to the united states, then were going to have these tariffs permanently. so the president cant have it both ways. bessent was on nbcs meet the press, hassett and summers appeared on abcs this week, lutnick and barrasso were on cbs face the nation and navarro was interviewed on fox news channels sunday morning futures. ______ associated press writers giada zampano in rome and fatima hussein in jupiter, florida, contributed to this report. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: Trump announces huge new tariffs to promote US manufacturing, risking inflation and trade wars
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 20:57:51)
  Content: by josh boak associated press washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the new tariffs, coming on what trump has named liberation day, are a bid to boost u.s. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he says are years of unfair trade practices. but by most economists assessments, the move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and upend decades-old alliances. the white house is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble. april 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern american history, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said tuesday. she said the new tariffs would take effect immediately. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. based on the possibility of broad 20 tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. because trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. leavitt is among three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the associated press on first and fifth amendment grounds. the ap says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. the white house says the ap is not following an executive order to refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america.

Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for ~5 paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies[cite: 44]. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for ~5 paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data[cite: 45]. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for ~5 paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data[cite: 46]. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles[cite: 47]. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for ~5 paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data[cite: 49]. Reference specific "Intriguing_angles" frame phrases. Pose cautious, speculative "What if?" questions *grounded* in the previous layers' analysis[cite: 48]. Explore potential hidden motives or unintended consequences *suggested by the evidence*, aligning with the persona's cautious approach[cite: 50].
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for ~5 paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
