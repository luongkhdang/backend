  Title: UN researchers warn that Asian scam operations are spreading across the rest of the world
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-21 15:23:50)
  Content: bangkok ap transnational organized crime groups in east and southeast asia are spreading their lucrative scam operations across the globe in response to increased crackdowns by authorities, according to a u.n. report issued on monday. for several years, scam compounds have proliferated in southeast asia, especially in border areas of cambodia, laos and myanmar, as well as in the philippines, shifting operations from site to site to stay a step ahead of the police. more recently, scam centers that have bilked victims out of billions of dollars through false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes are now being reported operating as far afield as africa and latin america. asian crime syndicates have been expanding operations deeper into remote areas with lax law enforcement that are vulnerable to the influx, according to the report issued by the u.n. office on drugs and crime or unodc. the report is titled inflection point global implications of scam centers, underground banking and illicit online marketplaces in southeast asia. this reflects both a natural expansion as the industry grows and seeks new ways and places to do business, but also a hedging against future risks should disruption continue and intensify in southeast asia, benedikt hofmann, unodcs acting regional representative for southeast asia and the pacific, said in a statement. unodc estimates that hundreds of industrial-scale scam centers generate just under 40 billion in annual profits. the trend to hedge beyond the region has been consistent with continued reports of crackdowns targeting asian-led scam centers that have been found operating in africa, south asia, the middle east and select pacific islands, as well as related money laundering, people trafficking and recruitment services discovered in europe, north america and south america. in africa, nigeria has become a hot spot, with police raids in late 2024 and early 2025 leading to many arrests, including people from east and southeast asia suspected of cryptocurrency and romance scams. zambia and angola have also busted asian-linked cyberfraud operations. in latin america, the report says that its notable that brazil has emerged as one country that has faced a growing set of challenges related to cyber-enabled fraud, online gambling, and related money laundering, with some linkages to criminal groups operating in southeast asia. it also notes that in late 2023 in peru, more than 40 malaysians were rescued after being trafficked by a taiwan-based gang known as the red dragon syndicate that forced them to commit cyber-enabled fraud. the report also points to crackdowns on asian-led scam centers in the middle east and some pacific islands. alarmingly, even as asian-led groups have been expanding the geographical scope of their operations, the involvement of criminal groups from other parts of the world is also growing, the report says. new online markets, money laundering networks, stolen data products, malware, artificial intelligence and deepfake technologies are laying the ground for the rise of crime as a service, the report says. these technological innovations facilitate conducting their businesses online and adapt to crackdowns. the convergence between the acceleration and professionalization of these operations on the one hand and their geographical expansion into new parts of the region and beyond on the other translates into a new intensity in the industry one that governments need to be prepared to respond to, hofmann says.

  Content: cape canaveral, fla. ap nasas lucy spacecraft has beamed back pictures from its latest asteroid flyby, revealing a long, lumpy, odd-shaped space rock. the space agency released the images monday, a day after the close approach. it was considered a dress rehearsal for the more critical asteroid encounters ahead closer to jupiter. this asteroid is bigger than scientists anticipated, about 5 miles 8 kilometers long and 2 miles 3.5 kilometers wide at its widest point resembling an irregular bowling pin. its so long that the spacecraft couldnt capture it in its entirety in the initial downloaded images. data returned over the next week should help clarify the asteroids shape, according to nasa. lucy passed within 600 miles 960 kilometers of the harmless asteroid known as donaldjohanson on sunday in the main asteroid belt between mars and jupiter. its named for the paleontologist who discovered the fossil lucy 50 years ago in ethiopia. the spacecraft was launched in 2021 to study the unexplored so-called trojan asteroids out near jupiter. eight trojan flybys are planned through 2033. ___ the associated press health and science department receives support from the howard hughes medical institutes science and educational media group and the robert wood johnson foundation. the ap is solely responsible for all content.

  Title: Anti-DEI fight just beginning, NIH cuts won’t kill bioscience and other commentary

  Content: university of pennsylvania signage is seen in philadelphia wednesday, may 15, 2019. campus watch anti-dei fight just beginning amid the trump anti-dei push, notes city journals heather mac donald, private and public entities are also calibrating their language to preserve as much of the pre-trump status quo as possible. schools like the university of california and the university of pennsylvania are shamming compliance with trump directives around fairness and standards. yes, the administration can flag certain words and phrases essential to the antiracist project. it can eliminate them from official executive branch pronouncements. but professional antiracists in faculties and bureaucracies wont cede power without a fight. uprooting the diversity ideology constitutes an existential threat. after this first round of executive orders and funding decisions, the trump administration will have to get even more creative in combating a poisonous worldview. the battle is just beginning. libertarian nih cuts wont kill bioscience critics claims that trump-proposed cuts to national institutes of health indirect funds will annihilate biomedical scientific research just dont stand up under scrutiny, explains zachary r. caverley at reason. in the era before the nih was spreading federal money, us biomedical-science was not hurting for private support the public sectors role in research achievements is often overstated. notably, the chief innovator of mrna vaccine tech, katalin karikó, was roadblocked for years in academia before creating the pfizer vaccine in the private sector. public funding plainly is not necessarily the crucial factor for scientific advancement and innovation. in practice, the private sector drives new technologies, since it does have motivation to invest in basic research. nynj beat pols frivolous-lawsuit addiction lawsuits targeting industries such as energy, agriculture and manufacturing have become en vogue for populist politicians and billionaire donors, lament alex daniel tom stebbins at usa today. yet these officials are racking up a string of losses at taxpayers expense. they blame energy companies for global emissions, though emissions dont come from energy production but from energy use. thats why judges have rejected several such suits. similar ones notably from new york and new jersey, have fared badly. these include new york attorney general letitia james suit against a meatpacker over its environmental impact. when will these politicians learn from their repeated failures? gov. hochul is adding judges to address a court backlog better if pols just stop filing bad cases. more from post editorial board astroturf alert democrats paid for brat cred kamala harris brat status last summer was quietly funded by an elusive group of democratic billionaires, realclearinvestigations lee fang reports. way to win, one of the major donor groups behind the effort, spent more than 9.1 million on social media influencers during the 2024 presidential election. much of the cash went to gen-z friendly influencers, like comedian illana glazer, who received way to win funding for a series of election videos called microdosing democracy, in which she half-heartedly endorsed harris as she lighted a spliff. while television or radio ads require disclaimers showing the groups responsible for paying for the advertisements, there are no equivalent mandates for tiktok stars or instagram personalities. to put it mildly, that tidal wave of enthusiasm for harris was not entirely genuine. eye on africa somalia falling for decades, the u.s. and african union have sought to keep the government of somalia afloat, but time is running out, warn jonathan sweet mark toth at the hill. muslim terror group al-shabaab is moving to capture mogadishu and establish a sunni caliphate in east africa. al-shabaab could be irans new proxy now that hamas and hezbollah have been significantly degraded. tehran aspires to shut down the red sea, and l-shabaab could be the missing ingredient. isis-somalia, al-qaeda and al-shabaab are major threats to the government of somalia, international shipping lanes and u.s. forces in the region. the trump administration must address al-shahaabs enablers namely, the houthi rebels, iran and russia. compiled by the post editorial board

  Title: China Claims Win in First Ever Race Between Humans And Robots
  Source: www.asiafinancial.com (2025-04-21 14:38:14)
  Content: chinese state-media were seen carrying glowing praise of the countrys tech progress, as humanoids raced against humans for the first time in beijing chinese state media carried glowing praise of the countrys technological progress on monday, as humanoid robots finished their first-ever race against humans in beijing over the weekend. state-backed newspapers, the global times, xinhua and china daily covered everything from the half-marathon itself to its coverage abroad in the us and in india while also hailing the race as a historic event and a breakthrough. chinas strategic focus on humanoid robotics signals its resolve to lead the next industrial revolution, read one editorial in state-backed china daily, which claimed robotics was chinas answer to everything from building supply chain resilience to tackling demographic challenges. as chinas workforce ages and labour costs rise, humanoid robots could fill critical roles in factories, eldercare and hazardous environments, the editorial said. and by localising production of core components like high-torque motors and advanced sensors, china aims to insulate itself from geopolitical disruptions, it went on to add. an editorial in the global times, meanwhile, seemed to take the opportunity to throw some shade on the united states ongoing trade and technology war against china. the editorial made no direct reference to the us, but repeated beijings oft-repeated stance on mutual exchange and win-win cooperation. on the path of technological innovation, no one can advance alone, the editorial concluded, after comparing human society to a marathon, where different nations drive overall progress through collaboration. the editorial also claimed that chinas goal in developing robotics is not to compete with any other major power but to continually challenge itself, surpass limits, and benefit humanity. in contrast, however, the china daily editorial claimed the marathon spoke to chinas determination to close the gap with western rivals like boston dynamics and tesla. the razzmatazz of the state-backed editorials stems from the fact this was the first ever race that pit humanoids against humans. while humanoid robots have made appearances at marathons in china over the past year, this is the first time they have actually raced alongside humans. the half-marathon was held on saturday and broadcast live, showing 21 humanoid robots many of them developed by state-backed firms and researchers running alongside thousands of human runners over a 21-kilometre course. a few of the robots wore running shoes, with one donning boxing gloves and another wearing a red headband with the words bound to win in chinese. but, interestingly most of the robots flailed and sputtered. one robot fell at the starting line and lay flat for a few minutes before getting up and taking off. one crashed into a railing after running a few metres, causing its human operator to fall over. almost every robot fell down and faced overheating problems, wired magazine noted in a report. meanwhile, all robots needed several battery swaps over the course of the marathon, the global times noted. but the state news site was quick to note that the struggles amid the humanoids to complete the race was due to the tech being an extremely complex field and that the marathon was actually a meaningful event to show developers what improvements they needed to make to enable commercialisation of the technology. state media was also seen hailing beijings decision to broadcast the race live and unedited a development that is indeed surprising considering the authoritarian chinese government is known to use significant public events such as these to carefully manage its image. behind this imperfect robot half-marathon is the mature atmosphere of tolerance, understanding and acceptance of failure that has developed in chinese society from top to bottom, the global times enthused. china daily, meanwhile, claimed in its editorial that the public, large-scale event mirrored the countrys ambition to create a collaborative ecosystem where state-backed entities work with private firms for quicker rd. the robots in saturdays marathon were all shapes and sizes, some shorter than 120cm 3.9 ft, others as tall as 1.8 metres 5.9 ft. one company boasted that its robot looked almost human, with feminine features and the ability to wink and smile. their manufacturers included private tech firms such as droidup and noetix, but also state-backed beijing innovation centre of human robotics, whose robot tiangong ultra won in the humanoid category. tiangong ultra finished the race in 2 hours and 40 minutes, more than an hour behind the mens winner of the race who wrapped up his run in 1 hour and 2 minutes. the beijing innovation centre, set up in 2023, is 43 owned by two state-owned enterprises, while tech giant xiaomis robotics arm and leading chinese humanoid robot firm ubtech have an equal share in the rest. tang jian, chief technology officer for the robotics centre, said tiangong ultras performance was aided by long legs and an algorithm allowing it to imitate how humans run a marathon. i dont want to boast but i think no other robotics firms in the west have matched tiangongs sporting achievements, tang said. but contrary to tang and chinese state medias excitement, analysts question whether having robots enter marathons is a reliable indicator of their industrial potential. alan fern, professor of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics at oregon state university, told reuters that contrary to claims from beijing officials that such a race requires ai breakthroughs, the software enabling humanoid robots to run was developed and demonstrated more than five years ago. chinese companies have really focused on showing off walking, running, dancing, and other feats of agility. generally, these are interesting demonstrations, but they dont demonstrate much regarding the utility of useful work or any type of basic intelligence, fern said. vishakha saxena is the multimedia and social media editor at asia financial. she has worked as a

  Title: Navy Is About To Go Big On Massive Joint War Training Across The Pacific - The War Zone
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-10 18:52:40)
  Content: published apr 8, 2025 227 pm edt u.s. navy photo by lt. lauren chatmas by signing up you agree to our and . the u.s. department of defense is starting to rehearse how its joint forces will fight as an integrated team across a massive battlespace in future war against china, rather than each of its services conducting their own maneuvers to practice for the same kind of scenario. in doing so, the aim is to get a much clearer idea in terms of requirements of what is needed to make such a complex combat engagement work. prior to this sea-change, critical requirements generation wasnt being done effectively or efficiently, according to vice adm. michael boyle, director of navy staff within the office of the chief of naval operations, who laid out the navys vision at the sea-air-space conference this week in national harbor, maryland. the type of training that boyle outlined underscores the fact that the pentagon is now grappling with the reality of having to fight china on a grand scale in the pacific theater. coupled with this is the reality that, to stand any chance of success in such a scenario, the u.s. military would require a full and near seamless integration of its joint forces as well as working alongside allies and partners. if were going to integrate the joint force, then how do we provide joint requirements? boyle observed when asked about particular challenges in the pacific theater. and so, i said, how do we provide joint requirements? and we really dont the services each provide requirements. so, whats the best place to determine what a requirement might be? in my mind, its joint rehearsal. i looked around to see where we do joint rehearsal, and we really dont, boyle said. what i saw was we do war games which validate a concept, we do experiments which validate a capability, and we do exercises which validate a plan, but we dont do rehearsal, even our field training exercises where we get the teams together, validate tactics but dont validate what the right capability to bring to the fight is. as a result of these traditional limitations on true joint exercises that prepare for a future indo-pacific conflict, the pentagon has sought to make changes, over the last couple of years, according to boyle, in the way it conducts these maneuvers. at first, the u.s. navy and air force were brought together for large-scale exercises with a pacific focus. subsequently, the army, marine corps, coast guard, and space force were added, for a series of joint rehearsals in the pacific. those rehearsals are run and executed by the tacticians who are going to fight them, boyle added. and so its not us trying to determine what kind of capabilities you can provide to the fleet. its the fleet saying, how do i win? and its not just the fleet, its the joint force. among the tactics specialists taking part in these drills, boyle named the navy fighter weapons school, air force weapons school, and marine expeditionary force mef from camp pendleton, california. the space force and cyber command also are playing key roles, all of them together, running through rehearsals at the tactical level and figuring out, how do i sense and make sense, boyle continued. thats whats happening in the fleet now, boyle said, and these requirements are starting to come in with a lot more fidelity, a lot more joint flavor. as well as involving the full breadth of the joint forces, this new approach to drills is notably forward-looking, with the aim of working out how to integrate the kinds of capabilities that we know were going to need in 2040 and in 2050, boyle reflected. i dont think we had a great system within the pentagon, and thats something were trying to change, boyle said, in relation to the way that pacific-focused exercises have traditionally been run, compared to how they are now being optimized. while boyle didnt refer to any particular exercises by name, its clear that larger, more joined up exercises are becoming increasingly significant, especially when it comes to rehearsing for indo-pacific contingencies. to a significant degree, this effort has been led by the air force, with reforpac return of forces to the pacific coming this year. a two-week exercise in the indo-pacific, this summers reforpac maneuvers are seen as a centerpiece of training events that are designed to better prepare for the threat of war against china. outlining reforpac, air force chief of staff gen. david w. allvin explained one of the issues that will be addressed that were starting to address, we saw a little bit of this most recent bamboo eagle is how mission-ready are we to deploy in a complex environment and sustain operations and be able to do logistics under attack? to be able to generate and maneuver within the environment, to sustain the mobility fleet that can get around, make sure the munitions and fuel and everything gets to the right place. allvin referred to bamboo eagle, another large-scale airpower-centric exercise that focuses on the demands of a future indo-pacific war. bamboo eagle takes place off the california coast and the first edition occurred last year, as you can read about in this past twz feature. the large force exercise series has quickly become one of the most important for the u.s. military, as well as key allies, and has a clear eye on preparing for a future coalition fight in the pacific with china. like bamboo eagle, reforpac will also see participation by u.s. allies and partners. after all, the indo-pacific theater is not only of growing strategic importance for the u.s. military. last year, for example, air forces from france, germany, and spain took part in pacific skies, an unprecedented exercise that took aircraft to the indo-pacific region in a multi-legged journey to work together with other air arms. as well as reflecting the continued pivot to asia, driven above all by chinas increasingly assertive military stance, these indo-pacific-focused exercises all grapple with the inherent challenges of a future conflict in this region. for example, a war with china in the indo-pacific would involve joint forces, allies, and partners fighting over vast geographic expanses, with the requirement to operate in an expeditionary capacity in the face of unprecedented high-threat weapons engagement zones. boyles remarks at sea-air-space underline the pentagons growing concerns about its forces readiness to fight a conflict in the indo-pacific region. they also point to the recognition that success in such a scenario will depend to a significant degree upon different forces working together in a way that hasnt necessarily been practiced in the past. contact the author thomasthewarzone.com usx-1 defiant, which will sail without humans onboard and is designed for mass production, is undergoing trials ahead of its long-endurance cruise. the late and over-budget constellation class design is still in flux, with only 15 commonality with the frigate its based on, not 85 as planned. weekly insights and analysis on the latest developments in military technology, strategy, and foreign policy. by signing up you agree to our and .

  Title: In A World Hooked On Hard Power And Greed, Latin America Offers Another Way - Worldcrunch
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-23 16:07:00)
  Content: bogotá we just need to listen to the declarations made by claudia sheinbaum about latin americas cooperation potential at the celac conference. from that speech last week in honduras by mexicos new president, we see anew how the 21st century has brought nothing but bad news for the poor of asia, africa and latin america. as the world gets more dangerous and divided, the newspapers seem to have one basic message for our continent it is irrelevant. for the latest news views from every corner of the world, worldcrunch today is the only truly international newsletter. sign up here. china as an economic power, russia as a military power and the united states as a technological power, are fighting for hegemony over the world. europe, the only region with which we have something in common, if only for our cultural affinities and aspirations, has lost clout and its own historical vocation. not that we are europe, nor do we even know yet what exactly we are only that, historically, latin america has always been a part of the spoils shared among the powers. as the economists say, at the banquet of politics, those not on the guest list are on the menu, and that is what has happened with our continent. but remember, the powerful are often conquered by their conquests. england colonized the united states only to end up in a subordinate position. the united states grabbed mexican territory and has ended up with an enormous hispanic population, with spanish as the countrys second language. europe invaded, well, everywhere, mixing the races and confounding the predominance of those supposedly purer races. it is a challenging moment in history, and latin america needs something more than a mere project for its own consumption. it should instead show that it is capable to become the face of a project that serves not armies or specific corporations or big tech, but humanity. take china, the great miracle of our time. it reinvented itself 75 years ago yanking 800 million people out of poverty and has shown over four decades that an ancient civilization can engage in a daring dialogue with modernity. but china is disciplined, collectivist and despotic and miracles of its caliber need those three conditions. russia is different. it appears to be vaster than the world itself, arousing greed and envy in all and sundry, but remains trapped in the clash of anarchy and despotism. it is a land of conflict, torment, barbaric violence and refinement. only russia, as a land of unique compassion and of extreme cruelty, could have given birth to that autocrat ivan the terrible, those giants of literature dostoevsky and tolstoy, lenin and stalin but also osip mandelstam, the poet who shared their horrific times. the united states was for a long time an example of faith in democracy, as defined by another poet, walt whitman. it came to symbolize humane instincts, institutional strengths and private enterprise, but also the work ethic, naivety and even excess. that very excess has led it to become the worlds most opulent, and most indebted, country, which ultimately means disaster. the counterpart to its internal freedom was external aggression. surprisingly, more than two centuries after the french revolution and its ideals of liberté, égalité and fraternité, the modern world is facing a far harsher paradigm the triple hegemony of the chinese model, which entirely disregards freedom the u.s. model, marked by its contempt for equality and the russian model, which has cast doubt on the very notion of fraternity. when europe sought to embody those principles, the counterpart to its internal freedom was external aggression its model of equality treated the rest of humanity as inferior and its dream of fraternity sank in the blood of endless wars nation against nation, race against race, sect against sect. europes history seems to suggest that equality is the enemy of freedom, and that freedom is the enemy of fraternity. europe gave birth to the philosophy of human rights and christian humanism. yet, as it infected the rest of the world with its christianity, its liberalism, marxism and yearning for material comfort and even supremacy, it was exhausting itself struggling to maintain unity and contain internal rivalries. china, russia and the united states have a far narrower interest, namely their own economic, military and technological supremacy. they appear oblivious to an unfolding reality that their transformative industries, insatiable rearmament, unfathomable technologies and their tug-of-war, may entail our collective downfall. the world needs more than this, something that cannot be given by industry, military power or the technological frenzy. and that is a sense of balance, not supremacy, of friendly cohabitation instead of the domineering urge, and a sense of awe for what we already have instead of follies and hubris. the ideal of living in opulence, with better weapons and control through technology has created a bubble of delusion that could burst at any moment. empires project themselves as endless but are surprisingly fragile. rome may have lasted for centuries, yet the soviet union only lasted decades, and napoleon and hitlers 1000-year reich a mere few years. and the current struggle between the planetary titans could turn everything to ash in moments. who knows if, as jesus declares in the bible, the meek shall inherit the earth, but its already clear the thugs of our world have a fight on their hands if they want it all. the future, should we ever see it, may yet belong to those who have nothing to lose, who wield no arms and are not consumed by hate. the compassionate among us have certainly more to give than any tycoon or philanthropist, while those who know what gratitude means are in turn enriched by this gift of god that makes everything before them a miracle. europes greatness is thus not in its empires but in christs doctrine, chinas and indias in the teachings of lao tseu and the buddha, russias in the lives and novels of dostoevsky and tolstoy, and the united states in the poetry of whitman and emily dickinson. these constitute a hoard of wealth available to the poorest among us. there have been barely any wars between latin american nations and we may be sure it wont be the message of opulence but the efforts of millions of ordinary workers that will restore dignity to our lives. our security wont come from inexhaustible, mechanized armies or giant prisons, but from our efforts to teach and live together. let us recall here, there have been barely any wars between latin american nations, as none aspires to supremacy. nobody will earn a place in history for wielding some crushingly effective technology, but for their ability to honor, protect and respectfully utilize what we still have namely the natural world we live in. in a world sickened with ambition, we might do well to read some of the gentle poetry of our continent like the missionary el misionero by argentinas almafuerte pedro palacios, lucky the normal people felices los normales by roberto fernández retamar or soft fatherland la suave patria by lópez velarde. for therein lie our grace and charm. to those beggars who need people to come and kneel before them, the colombian poet porfirío barba jacob has said in all his splendor, rest your fatigue on mine, and i shall lay my grief on yours. to the greedy who say they must grab a piece of land or a planet, diogenes the cynic said from the depths of the past, repeating the words of his teacher antisthenes, that in this world, the only things of value are those floating to the surface with their owner in a shipwreck. it is always good to listen to a calm and respectful voice, when blind powers want to send us full speed toward the ultimate shipwreck.

  Title: Letter from Nikkei Asia's editor: Trump's tariff shockwaves force Asia to rethink trade strategies
  Source: asia.nikkei.com (2025-04-19 18:49:15)
  Content: hello from tokyo. the erratic tariff policies of u.s. president donald trump and his government have continued to shock the global economy since i took over the role of editor-in-chief at the beginning of the month. amid the turmoil, nikkei asia has published a series of articles this week on the various measures being taken to counter the risks posed by trumps trade war. apple has started ramping up production of key products in india and vietnam to take advantage of a 90-day grace period on u.s. tariffs. honda motor, meanwhile, is working on plans to relocate production of models to the u.s. from mexico and canada in response to an additional 25 tariff imposed by the trump administration on all imported automobiles. global companies face the massive headache of overhauling the complex supply chains they have spent years building to mitigate the risks posed by trumps policies. and its not just multinational corporations being forced to rethink their strategies. starting this monday, chinese president xi jinping visited three asean countries - vietnam, malaysia and cambodia - calling for cooperation in response to the trade war with the u.s. earlier this week, japanese prime minister shigeru ishiba spoke on the phone with singaporean prime minister lawrence wong, exchanging views on washingtons tariff measures and beijings retaliatory actions. a few days later, japan sent a trade envoy to the white house for talks with trump. washingtons use of tariffs to pressure other governments appears to be prompting asian leaders to explore new cooperative relationships. asian economies - and the governments behind them - are likely to be the hardest hit by the fallout from this massive trade war. as the global economy and geopolitical landscape reach a historic turning point, we will continue to report on the impact from an asian perspective. i invite you to visit nikkei asia to explore our latest coverage. my suggested reads 1. while global financial markets have been roiled by u.s. president donald trumps tariff policies, the philippine peso is bracing for a potential jolt as trumps promised immigration crackdown threatens to disrupt global labor markets and squeeze the countrys key economic lifeline billions in remittances sent home by overseas filipino workers. 2. japans mighty auto industry has watched for years as chinese rivals gained market share with cheaper, more electrified offerings. now japanese carmakers and suppliers are banding together to develop a standardized chip design that they hope will give them a competitive edge in the smart car age. 3. the u.s. reciprocal tariffs have prompted political leaders to push for greater intra-asean trade. but this will prove easier said than done. analysts say aseans weak internal trade stems from structural and institutional limitations, such as export-driven economies, wide income disparities and a reliance on similar intermediate goods or commodities. 4. in what is vietnams most ambitious restructuring push in nearly 40 years, the government has decided to slash the number of provinces and cities from the current 63 to 34 by september. to lam, general secretary of the communist party and successor to nguyen phu trong, who passed away last july, is driving unprecedented reforms to sustain the countrys economic growth. 5. the completion of chinas massive three gorges dam in 2015 paved the way for large cruise ships to offer multiday river journeys on the mighty yangtze, including passage through the gorges - still a major draw, even if their scenic wonder has faded somewhat. writer john krich shares his experience aboard the yangzi explorer as the luxury liner makes its way upstream from yichang to chongqing. through the lens this weeks top photo pick the grand ring, a symbol of expo 2025 osaka and one of the worlds largest wooden structures, is pictured on april 16. more than 140,000 people booked tickets to visit on opening day on april 13. while the venue was bustling despite worries over sluggish momentum, issues also emerged for the line-free expo that the japan association for the 2025 world exposition has aimed for. photo by hiromasa matsuura check out more of our photo coverage here. wishing you a wonderful weekend! akito tanaka follow us on linkedin and instagram. sign up for the weekly editor-in-chiefs picks newsletter here.

  Title: The Brief – Macron’s Mayotte mission
  Source: www.euractiv.com (2025-04-22 16:09:22)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article highlights France's struggle to maintain its global power projection through its overseas territories amidst rising challenges from regional powers like China and potential interference from the US. This aligns with Realism's emphasis on states pursuing their national interests in a competitive international environment. The text states, "as the pacific becomes a key arena for the looming confrontation between china and the united states, beijing is closely monitoring developments in frances regional territories," demonstrating the power dynamics at play. This suggests that France's actions are driven by a desire to maintain its influence and security in the face of external threats, a core tenet of Realism.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Macron's promise of 3.2 billion over six years to Mayotte, but also notes the "chronic under-equipment of french armed forces." This juxtaposition raises questions about resource allocation priorities. Is France prioritizing short-term economic relief over long-term strategic defense capabilities in its overseas territories? What are the potential consequences of this imbalance for France's ability to project power and maintain sovereignty in these regions?; Intriguing_angles: The article frames the EU as a potential solution for managing France's overseas territories, suggesting a "shared destiny between the old continent and its most distant outposts?" However, it also acknowledges that these territories are subject to different legal frameworks within the EU. This raises the question of whether the EU is truly equipped to address the unique challenges and needs of these diverse territories, or if this is simply a way for France to offload its responsibilities.
  Key Entities Mentioned:
    - European Union:
      > Snippet: pending any meaningful progress at the european level, french prime minister françois bayrou had, upon his appointment last december, made the overseas territories one of his top priorities.
      > Snippet: would it not be justified, werly asks, to make these territories a strategic priority for europe not as a dominating or imperial power, but as proof of a shared destiny between the old continent and its most distant outposts?
      > Snippet: under the 2009 lisbon treaty, the eus outermost regions are integrated into the common market and subject to a legal framework that is almost identical to that of other european regions.
    - Donald Trump:
      > Snippet: and what would prevent us president donald trump from pushing for independence in polynesia or new caledonia to gain a foothold there?
    - Senate:

    - Emmanuel Macron:
      > Snippet: the overseas territories, according to president macron, will now serve as a cornerstone of frances global power projection strategy.

in an excellent issue of politique étrangère, journalist richard werly paints a stark picture of the fragility of frances position in its overseas territories. the time will come when france will be forced to reconsider its ties and authority over departments and territories it can no longer, or no longer wishes to, manage, he writes, suggesting that their economic viability and political future should be debated at the eu level. under the 2009 lisbon treaty, the eus outermost regions are integrated into the common market and subject to a legal framework that is almost identical to that of other european regions. the overseas countries and territories, such as greenland, are not part of the eu but have associate status, although their citizens hold eu passports. would it not be justified, werly asks, to make these territories a strategic priority for europe not as a dominating or imperial power, but as proof of a shared destiny between the old continent and its most distant outposts? protecting these territories could thus form the distant embryo of an autonomous european defence. pending any meaningful progress at the european level, french prime minister françois bayrou had, upon his appointment last december, made the overseas territories one of his top priorities. the reconstruction of mayotte and the management of the crisis in new caledonia will determine whether paris still has the legitimacy to offer a future-oriented project to the populations of its overseas lands. tech the commission is assessing googles use of ai summaries at the top of its search results under the digital markets act dma and eu law, amid a broader structural clash over ai-aided internet services. ceasefire talks russia shelled five ukrainian regions within hours of a promised easter truce, reviving a familiar pattern of broken ceasefire deals that now looms over this weeks latest round of talks. the vatican pope francis died on monday in the middle of the churchs jubilee year. now, the vatican faces an awkwardly literal question who gets to close the year?

  Title: EU leaders push for influence at Central Asia summit
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-04 03:01:43)
  Content: the eu proclaimed a new era in ties with central asia on friday at a major summit in uzbekistan, as brussels presses its influence in the region in the face of russian and chinese competition. russias invasion of ukraine has accelerated the regions drift from moscows orbit, with major powers to both the west and east sensing an opening. the presidents of the five central asian countries - kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, tajikistan, turkmenistan and uzbekistan - welcomed the eus top leaders to the summit in the ancient silk road city of samarkand. central asia is rich in natural resources, on the front lines of climate change and a key security player trying to contain extremism, sharing borders with afghanistan, iran, china and russia. this is the start of a new era in our ancient friendship, eu chief ursula von der leyen told central asian leaders in samarkand, for centuries a key hub in east-west connections, trade and commerce. the european commission chief and antonio costa - the head of the european council - were in uzbekistan as us president donald trumps tariff offensive sparked global market shock. we are at another turning point. new global barriers arise, investments are being redirected, powers around the world are carving up new spheres of influence, von der leyen said. reliable partners have never been so important. we want to explore new avenues, she said, calling for a strategic partnership with the region. central asia is interested in europes advanced industrial technology - which russia and china struggle to provide - while brussels eyes the regions precious resources. - honey pot - these resources are a honey pot for global players, von der leyen said. the landlocked region has an abundance of uranium, cobalt, copper and other essential materials. alongside russias historic leadership in the region, turkey, china, the united states and even the likes of south korea and japan are interested in the resources. europes offer is different, von der leyen pledged, promising to help develop local industries. she also said brussels wanted to help central asia become a clean energy power house. she announced that europes satellites could bring internet to remote areas, where it is scarce. it would give direct access to high-speed internet without your neighbours acting as gatekeepers, she said, in an apparent reference to russia, which tightly controls access to information. - climate change - central asia has been hit by climate change at a dramatic rate, with massive glaciers melting, a critical shortage of water and farming badly affected. von der leyen said central asia and europe were warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. europe wants to work alongside you in adapting to a changing climate, she added. uzbek president shavkat mirziyoyev said that warming ties between the five regional countries in recent years had made the summit possible. nobody would be able to even imagine that in the near future we could stand together to represent the region in talks with european leaders, he said. mirziyoyev came to power in uzbekistan after the death of dictator islam karimov in 2016. he has opened up the country after years of closed borders, but rights groups have said the region has a worsening record on human rights. despite pleas from ngos, human rights were not expected to feature heavily in the talks, an eu official told afp on condition of anonymity. were not going there to preach, but we are going to make our concerns known, to work with them, to have a dialogue, the official said. - sanctions - von der leyen said that russia has long shown it cannot be a reliable partner anymore. but russia and chinas influence will be difficult to dislodge. beijing is pouring cash into ambitious infrastructure projects, while russia supplies arms and energy, with long-standing cultural and linguistic reach across the former soviet states. the war in ukraine and sanctions against russia will also be on the table at the talks, the eu official said. central asia has emerged as one of several hubs through which sanctioned western goods are re-exported to russia. brussels would like the region to crack down on the flow, as it pushes to keep up the pressure on moscow while trump oversees a rapprochement with the kremlin. central asian countries have shown willingness to act and some progress but we would like to see a lot more from our partners, the eu official said. bur-occadsbk

  Title: China warns countries against striking trade deals with USA at its expense...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-21 14:40:39)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Neorealism, the article's description of the 'spiralling trade war' and actions like the US trying to 'curb beijings progress' and China seeking to 'strengthen solidarity with all parties' suggests states are prioritizing relative power and security in an anarchic system, viewing economic interactions through a competitive lens.; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory helps explain the article's focus. By highlighting specific government statements ('commerce ministry said', 'ministry spokesperson said'), actions ('washington has raised tariffs', 'beijing will convene'), and expert/corporate reactions ('bo zhengyuan said', 'ai chip giant nvidia said'), the article directs reader attention to these particular facets of the conflict, shaping the perceived importance of different events.; Intriguing_angles: The article attributes China's strong reaction to a 'bloomberg report, citing sources familiar with the matter' about US pressure tactics. This framing, based on unsourced information, positions China's response as reactive. How does the reliance on an unsourced 'bloomberg report' shape the narrative of China's response? What interests might be served by leaking this specific US strategy at this particular moment?; Intriguing_angles: While China's accusations of US 'abusing tariffs' and 'bullying' are prominent, the specific US justifications for its actions (e.g., 'military purposes' for chip curbs, limiting 'dominance' in shipbuilding) are mentioned briefly. By focusing heavily on China's accusations and less on the detailed US rationale, how might the article implicitly influence the reader's perception of who is the primary aggressor or victim in this conflict?

  Content: by liz lee and laurie chen beijing reuters -china on monday accused washington of abusing tariffs and warned countries against striking a broader economic deal with the united states at its expense, ratcheting up its rhetoric in a spiralling trade war between the worlds two biggest economies. beijing will firmly oppose any party striking a deal at chinas expense and will take countermeasures in a resolute and reciprocal manner, its commerce ministry said. the ministry was responding to a bloomberg report, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the trump administration is preparing to pressure nations seeking tariff reductions or exemptions from the u.s. to curb trade with china, including imposing monetary sanctions. president donald trump paused the sweeping tariffs he announced on dozens of countries on april 2 except those on china, singling out the worlds second largest economy for the biggest levies. in a series of moves, washington has raised tariffs on chinese imports to 145, prompting beijing to slap retaliatory duties of 125 on u.s. goods. last week, china signalled that its own across-the-board rates would not rise further. the united states has abused tariffs on all trading partners under the banner of so-called equivalence, while also forcing all parties to start so-called reciprocal tariffs negotiations with them, the ministry spokesperson said. china is determined and capable of safeguarding its own rights and interests, and is willing to strengthen solidarity with all parties, the ministry said. the fact is, nobody wants to pick a side, said bo zhengyuan, partner at china-based policy consultancy plenum. if countries have high reliance on china in terms of investment, industrial infrastructure, technology know-how and consumption, i dont think theyll be buying into u.s. demands. many southeast asian countries belong to this category. pursuing a hardline stance, beijing will this week convene an informal united nations security council meeting to accuse washington of bullying and casting a shadow over the global efforts for peace and development by weaponizing tariffs. earlier this month, u.s. trade representative jamieson greer said nearly 50 countries have approached him to discuss the steep additional tariffs imposed by president donald trump. several bilateral talks on tariffs have taken place since, with japan considering raising soybean and rice imports as part of its talks with the u.s. while indonesia is planning to increase u.s. food and commodities imports and reduce orders from other nations. caught in crossfire trumps tariff policies have rattled financial markets as investors fear a severe disruption in world trade could tip the global economy into recession. on monday, chinese stocks inched higher, showing little reaction to the commerce ministry comments, though investors have generally remained cautious on chinese assets due to the rising growth risks. the trump administration also has been trying to curb beijings progress in developing advanced semiconductor chips which it says could be used for military purposes, and last week imposed port fees on china-built vessels to limit chinas dominance in shipbuilding. ai chip giant nvidia said last week it would take 5.5 billion in charges due to the administrations curbs on ai chip exports. chinas president xi jinping visited three southeast asian countries last week in a move to bolster regional ties, calling on trade partners to oppose unilateral bullying. beijing has said it is tearing down walls and expanding its circle of trading partners amid the trade row. the stakes are high for southeast asian nations caught in the crossfire of the sino-u.s. tariff war, particularly given the regional asean blocs huge two-way trade with both china and the united states. asean is chinas largest trading partner, with total trade value reaching 234 billion in the first quarter of 2025 and accounting for over 16 of chinas overall foreign trade, chinas customs agency said last week. trade between asean and the u.s. totalled around 476.8 billion in 2024, according to u.s. figures, making washington the regional blocs fourth-largest trading partner. there are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars, xi said in an article published in vietnamese media, without mentioning the united states. reporting by liz lee editing by tom hogue and shri navaratnam

  Title: We’re calling it now: Agentic AI will win RSAC buzzword Bingo
  Source: www.theregister.com (2025-04-23 17:49:22)
  Content: the security industry loves its buzzwords, and this is always on full display at the annual rsa conference event in san francisco. dont believe us? take a lap on the expo floor, and youll be bombarded with enough acronyms and over-the-top claims to send you straight to the nearest bar, which will likely serve specialty cocktails with names like the great casb and firewall fizz. while the last couple of years have been all about ai promising fully autonomous security operations centers socs and predicting that large language models llms could exploit zero-days with no human intervention we expect the 2025 conference at the end of this month to be all about agentic ai. as with all emerging tech, ai agents mean different things to different people. but broadly speaking, its a task-oriented ai that sits on top of a llm and can analyze data and take action, at least somewhat independently of a human. these agents are designed to learn and improve over time, serving as intelligent assistants to security analysts rather than mere script executors. while some claims about agentic ai at rsac will be grounded in reality, plenty will be pure hype, but either way you wont be able to avoid it. from the monday, april 28 keynote titled security in the age of agentic ai, to vendors pitching how their ai agents are tackling tasks like malware analysis or defending against the latest agent-spawned threats, itll be everywhere. weve already seen early glimpses at recent vendor conferences, including microsoft ignite and google cloud next this year, where those two tech giants, along with other software vendors, have eagerly jumped aboard the agentic ai bandwagon. last year, it was about building genai assistants into software to help the administration perform an individual task. for example, write a policy or explain a finding, gartner research vp neil macdonald told the register. 2025 is all about ai agents, where an orchestrated set of actions are completed autonomously by the agent 2025 is all about ai agents or agentic ai where an orchestrated set of actions are completed autonomously by the agent, he said. its the difference between ai being a smart helper and responding to you versus agentic ai doing process- and outcome-specific things for you proactively and without the need for step-by-step guidance. while there are use cases for ai agents across nearly every industry, from payment processing to fast-food ordering, security examples include soc-related tasks such as analyzing event logs, detecting unusual traffic patterns, and triaging alerts. from an analytical process within security, an ai agent can analyze vast amounts of data very quickly, so this takes away the need for an analyst sitting behind the keyboard to constantly be writing the logic of what theyre looking for, jason lord, chief technology officer at salesforce-focused security firm autorabit told the register. agents are also effective at spotting phishing attacks, which are increasingly being generated by ai themselves. for example, an agent can analyze an email and determine this is a bad return address, lord said. this is a fake logo. this is a url thats hosted in a .parks domain and has only been up for the last 12 hours. this is legitimately bad. filter it to the security team. additionally, agents - like earlier ai tools used in network analysis - can help detect threats and flag potentially malicious traffic across large enterprise environments. so when youre looking for a security breach, and youre looking at alerts that are firing all day long, what it can do is piece those together and say, hey, based on previous detections, these three functions just happened. and heres all of the data that ive just pulled and provided to you to go make that human intelligence decision, lord said. but there are tasks that lord says he wouldnt want an agent to do. i wouldnt want it going and changing signature detection or logic, he said. i wouldnt want it opening or closing firewall ports. i wouldnt want it disabling or overriding security functions. theres also a lot that needs to happen to ensure that the agents are secured. like any ai system, theres risk bad actors could poison the data used to train the model, or trick an agent into doing something it shouldnt. im not going to go full skynet, lord said, referring to the rogue ai from the terminator films that wipes out humanity, but an ai agent could perform functions that close sections of your network, or the entire network. it could create a denial of service, internally or externally, by not having resources available. it could unintentionally leak data, pii. it could override data protection classes and allow information to be sent outside the organization. it all goes back to whos looking at this, whos going to be able to identify that theres an agent doing something incorrectly? were too focused on the excitement, not the paranoia the problem with all of the hype around agentic ai is that were too focused on the excitement, not the paranoia. paul davis, field ciso at supply chain security shop jfrog, told the register. just like genai for code, we need to have people who actually check it before they let it loose. davis pointed to manufacturing, an industry he has first-hand experience with, as an example, where computers have to be shut down and brought back online in a certain sequence or else the systems wont run properly. unless youve taught the ai about that sequence and most people dont think about it its going to break it, he said. plus, there are privacy and security concerns tied to the data used to train these models where is the data stored, and for how long? who has access to it? can it be deleted, and if so, by whom? an ai agent without data is dead in the water, davis said. data regulations are going to go nuts. so weve got the aspects of a thing that generates code, a thing that makes decisions, and runs on an infrastructure that deals with data, he added. agentic ai is on the verge of being sort of mass population. its gonna get a bit scary, and i think were going to have a few bumps on the journey. one thing seems clear its gonna be the talk of rsac, so mark agentic ai on your bingo cards, stat. i want a penny every time i hear ai or read ai at rsa so i can retire, lord said. yes, you read that correctly just a penny. and how many pennies does he expect that to net? a house in puerto rico. beach front.

  Title: SE Asia keeps the peace 50 years after Vietnam War - Asia Times
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-21 04:14:51)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article highlights the ongoing competition between the US and China for influence in Southeast Asia. "washington has tried to force southeast asia to align with its aims of constraining and countering chinas rise." This reflects a realist perspective, where states are seen as rational actors pursuing their national interests in a competitive international system. The article suggests that Southeast Asian nations are attempting to balance these competing pressures to maintain their own security and autonomy.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that "beijing was satisfied with receiving symbolic forms of tribute, from which southeast asian kingdoms mostly profited in terms of trade." This seems to contradict the later assertion that "beijings win-win rhetoric wears thin in a region that fears the overbearing weight of the chinese economy." Why did the author include both seemingly contradictory statements? Could this suggest a shift in China's approach or a more nuanced understanding of Southeast Asian perceptions of China's economic influence?

  Content: on april 30, 1975, the last american helicopter lifted off the roof of the us embassy in saigon hours before north vietnamese tanks crashed through the gates of then-south vietnams presidential palace, marking the end of the vietnam war. since then, southeast asia has been mostly unafflicted by interstate war. there was, of course, vietnams invasion of cambodia in december 1978 and chinas retaliatory assault on vietnam along their shared border months later in 1979. but these were largely legacies of indochinas larger conflict that started when france sought to defeat vietnams bid for independence in the 1950s. the lesson of this period half a century ago, which cost as many as four million lives, is that great powers were militarily defeated and failed to prevail. southeast asian states, although riven by internal tension and conflict, have since then managed to fend off external intrusion and coexist in awkward though peaceful equilibrium. this signifies a historical resilience and immunity that, in todays era of multipolarity and evolving spheres of influence, should serve southeast asia well. as other regions of the world fall prey to proxy conflict and perpetual instability particularly the middle east the ten nations of southeast asia have managed to resist overt great power alignment and enjoy relative geopolitical stability. southeast asia has always been difficult to subjugate. in pre-modern times, it was hard for the larger powers to mount anything other than cultural invasions. india and chinas influence was largely maintained using trade, diplomacy and, in the case of india, spirituality, as rulers in the region found useful ways to harness the caste-based hierarchies of hinduism. china repeatedly sought to impose control over vietnam but was time and again repelled. beijing was satisfied with receiving symbolic forms of tribute, from which southeast asian kingdoms mostly profited in terms of trade. the arrival of europeans in the 16th century heralded more successful intrusion, with the portuguese, spanish, dutch, english and later the french establishing trading empires based on military control over key ports. much later these became the focal points of larger imperial domains that harnessed people to the land to produce valuable exports of commodities. only thailand resisted imperial takeover while relinquishing territory to ever-pressing french and british empires to its east and west. japans invasion and occupation of the region in the 1940s set the stage for home-grown nationalism that eventually managed to overcome european rule. it was this strong sense of nationalist identity, drawing on european ideas of liberalism as well as communism, that set the stage for americas ultimate defeat in vietnam. today, two generations on, the vietnam war is a distant memory. although for much of the region outside vietnam there was much to gain from the wider impact of the conflict, and for the people of the region, just as much to lose. americas anti-communist crusade was beneficial for countries like thailand and the philippines, which saw a boom in trade and investment supported by us fears of the spread of communist ideology. this same fear of communist takeover stimulated us support for strongman military rule in many countries and stifled the democratic impulses that accompanied successful anti-colonial struggles. it took another two decades for the after-effects of american intervention to be rolled back. the peoples power revolution in the philippines in 1986 forced the us to abandon its close anti-communist ally ferdinand marcos after filipinos revolted against his repressive and kleptocratic rule. a decade plus later, suharto of indonesia, another anti-communist western ally, also succumbed to a popular reform movement. ironically, perhaps, communist party-ruled vietnam itself has not seen a longer-term freedom dividend. the triumph of hanois communist leadership over the us laid the foundations of enduring one-party rule, even as the vietnamese economy has thrived and grown into a regional powerhouse. laos and cambodia greatly suffered during the indochina conflict from massive collateral bombing campaigns that spawned harsh reactionary politics and longer-term instability from which neither country has fully recovered. as for the larger powers, half a century later, the us and china have resumed their contest for primacy in the region. for the past 15 years, washington has tried to force southeast asia to align with its aims of constraining and countering chinas rise. china has reacted by asserting claims to islands and features in the south china sea, somewhat undermining a more constructive policy since the 1990s of mutually beneficial trade and investment in the now hotly contested maritime region. even as beijings win-win rhetoric wears thin in a region that fears the overbearing weight of the chinese economy, the new trump administrations reckless trade and financial policies, not to mention the dismantling of american aid programs, have undermined the biden administrations efforts to strengthen allies and partners in the region. ultimately what has saved southeast asia from another protracted period of inter-state conflict is the regions refusal to take sides. during the vietnam war, thailand dispatched more than 35,000 troops to help defend us-backed south vietnam, while the philippines sent another 10,000 troops. today, this kind of military deployment would be hard to imagine, even though thailand and the philippines remain treaty allies of the us. one significant upshot of the indochina conflict has been the creation of weak but functional multilateral regional frameworks. the association of southeast asian nations asean, established in 1967, was principally designed to prevent interstate conflict in the region. although much maligned for its inability to manage internal conflicts within member states such as myanmar, asean has largely achieved what it was designed to do. the inability of middle eastern states to forge the same kind of multilateral cooperation and resilience has made it much easier for the us and other emerging regional powers to continue to intervene. fifteen years after the end of the iraq war, us troops remain stationed across the middle east and there is currently the possibility of a war against iran. fifty years after that last american helicopter left saigon, the us deploys a small number of rotational troops under a non-permanent base agreement with the philippines, but the majority, some 80,000, are based in japan and south korea. for if there is to be a conflict between china and the us, it is more likely to be in northeast asia, in and around the taiwan strait. michael vatikiotis, former editor-in-chief of the far eastern economic review, is a writer and veteran observer of southeast asian affairs. the views expressed

  Title: With U.S. Absent, China Steps in for Earthquake-Hit Myanmar
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-02 12:01:23)
  Content: by poppy mcpherson and antoni slodkowski bangkokbeijing reuters - after a 7.7 magnitude earthquake shook myanmar on friday, killing more than 2,800 people, international rescuers rushed into the devastated southeast asian country. the most ubiquitous among them have been chinese relief workers, whose blue and orange uniforms appear across videos circulating on social media. the posts are often accompanied with expressions of gratitude toward beijing, whose first responders - as well as their indian and russian colleagues - have pulled dazed survivors and bodies out from the rubble of hotels, schools, and monasteries. the reaction marks a change in the negative reception china often receives on myanmars social media because of its support for the unpopular military junta. americas chief geopolitical rival has so far pledged to deliver 100 million yuan 13.76 million worth of supplies. the first batch of aid, including tents, blankets and first aid kits arrived in yangon on monday, beijing has said. the united states, which was until recently the worlds top humanitarian donor, has offered a relatively modest 2 million. washington also said it would send a three-member assessment team, though their arrival has been delayed by problems obtaining visas from the military regime. in past years, when tsunamis, earthquakes and other disasters struck around the world, the u.s. had regularly and rapidly deployed skilled rescue workers to save lives. the american absence shows how president donald trumps moves to slash the size of the u.s. government has hobbled its ability to act during disasters, three current and former u.s. officials told reuters. with trumps blessing, billionaire elon musks department of government efficiency has enacted huge funding cuts and contractor terminations across the federal bureaucracy in the name of targeting wasteful spending. trump has also moved to fire nearly all u.s. agency for international development staff, who oversee washingtons disaster response efforts overseas. a functional usaid would have activated urban search-and-rescue teams that were capable of being deployed to myanmar in 48 hours, said marcia wong, formerly a top humanitarian official at usaid. but most of the people who would have coordinated the response have been let go, while third-party partners have lost contracts, she said. we have created a vacuum which can allow other actors to step in, wong said. former u.s. ambassador to myanmar scot marciel told reuters that while it was unlikely the junta would have allowed big u.s. military teams to enter, washington could still have responded more quickly and robustly were it not for the cuts. the state department, which administers the remaining usaid programs, did not immediately return a request for comment. the junta and chinas foreign ministry also did not respond to questions. secretary of state marco rubio said on x that the cuts targeted programs that did not serve, and in some cases even harmed u.s. interests. his spokesperson tammy bruce told reporters monday that disaster relief experts were monitoring the situation. china on front foot hours after the quake, the trump administration told congress in a pre-planned move that it was firing nearly all remaining usaid personnel and closing its foreign missions. meanwhile, beijing dispatched first-response teams, including dozens of medical workers, earthquake experts, field hospital workers and rescue dogs. those teams have been some of the main visible signs of official assistance in affected areas like mandalay and sagaing, where residents said they received no help from the military. indias foreign ministry said on tuesday its aircraft and ships had delivered 625 tons of aid, while rescue workers had recovered 16 bodies from mandalay and treated 104 patients. russia and india have also set up mobile hospitals. china has used its state media machine to broadcast its relief efforts. english-language state broadcaster cgtn was one of the few international media outlets with reporters sending on-camera dispatches from mandalay, the epicentre of the disaster. state-run news agency xinhua has also run extensive reports showing chinas relief efforts. some rescue teams entered myanmar from chinas yunnan province, travelling overland through areas held by rebels which are opposed to the junta but have a complex relationship with beijing. the decision to send rescuers by road as well as air was seen by analysts like sai tun aung lwin as a signal from beijing that it had influence with both the rebels and the junta. china appears to have opened a humanitarian corridor that effectively stretches through rebel and junta territory, said the researcher, who studies chinas role in myanmar. on social media, the anti-china sentiment is in significant decline. the junta said wednesday it had fired warning shots at a convoy from the chinese red cross because it had not asked permission to drive from yunnan through to mandalay, including through areas where junta troops have been clashing with opposition armies. beijing later said there were no casualties. profound gratitude myanmar sits between china and india and is of crucial strategic importance to both countries. washington also enjoyed warm relations with the southeast asian nation under a brief quasi-democratic period before the military seized power in 2021, toppling the elected government led by nobel peace laureate aung san suu kyi. the junta has brutally quashed dissent and sparked a spiralling civil war. however, it remains backed by beijing, which sees the junta as a guarantor of stability though rebel forces now control most of the borderlands. many in the opposition regard china negatively for its role propping up the military. a 2024 poll of regional decision-makers by the iseas-yusof ishak institute, a singapore-based think-tank, found 65 of myanmar respondents distrusted beijing. a spokesperson for myanmars national unity government, a parallel administration that includes members of suu kyis deposed government, said in a statement that it had profound gratitude to the international rescue teams who have arrived without delay to assist and save the people of myanmar. washington has retained influence, especially among the opposition to the junta, through humanitarian aid and funds for the democracy movement. the recent trump-directed cuts, however, have largely erased both. at least 28 usaid and state department programs supporting myanmar have been terminated, according to documents shared with congress and reviewed by reuters. marciel said washingtons relations with myanmar should matter to u.s. citizens because winning international backing for matters of national concern, including the willingness to stand up to china at times - all depend heavily on the extent of u.s. influence. reporting by poppy mcpherson in bangkok and

  Title: These Chinese AI Companies Could Be The Next DeepSeek
  Source: www.forbes.com (2025-04-10 21:30:23)
  Content: andrashi shrivastava, injanuary, a little-known chinese ai lab named deepseek rocked the world when it released an advanced open source model that rivaled those of u.s. tech giants, seemingly using a fraction of their resources. a whos who of ais juggernauts, from openai to anthropic, lauded the companys achievements while defending their own progress and methods. president donald trump called it a wake-up call. but beyond that viral moment, spun up by ais own frothy hype cycle and a frenzy of geopolitical concerns, deepseeks emergence had a deeper impact it put the spotlight on chinese ai, and gave it a face on an international stage. deepseek and other chinese companies were not included on the ai 50 list, which honors the most promising privately-held companies in artificial intelligence, because their financials and business practices are opaque. but they are worth highlighting as many of them make significant impacts beyond china, thanks to an emphasis on open source models made freely available for anyone to use. many of the chinese ai models gaining traction are made by the countrys tech giants. theres video generation app hunyuan, owned by tech conglomerate tencent, the 92 billion 2024 revenue maker of wechat. the company claims its recent reasoning ai models, which can answer complex questions by breaking them into smaller sub-questions, outperform deepseeks flagship models. then theres doubao, a consumer-focused app from tiktok parent bytedance, which has built spatial models that analyze physical environments and generate 3d landscapes. theres also qwen, a family of large language models from the ecommerce behemoth alibaba, which has amassed more than 90,000 enterprise users on the companys cloud platform. alibaba is kind of the leading big tech ai champion in china, comparable to what google or meta represent in the u.s., rob toews, a partner at radical ventures, told forbes. as of publication, models from alibaba and deepseek were among the top 5 trending models on hugging face, a widely used hub for open source ai models and datasets. in the realm of open source releases, there is no such barrier. there is no great firewall. deepseeks meteoric rise opened the floodgates for other chinese startups. in march, wuhan-based startup butterfly effect launched an ai system called manus, which it claims can autonomously browse the web and do things like search for apartments, analyze stocks and design websites. the tool has some pitfalls, ranging from making incorrect assumptions about the task at hand to crashing while processing large amounts of text. but its release was praised as an emerging rival to openais service, operator. fueled by the likes of twitter cofounder jack dorsey, buzz around the company has drawn investor interest butterfly effect is reportedly in talks to raise funding from us-based investors at a 500 million valuation, according to the information. while deepseek built its models by finetuning other models from meta and alibaba, manus managed to use anthopics claude models off the shelf. its basically a much better version of what openai is trying to do with operator, toews said. china has been making significant leaps in humanoid robotics too. agibot, founded in 2023 by former huawei genius youth recruit peng zhihui, claims it has already manufactured over 1,000 ai-powered bipedal robots and reportedly plans to grow that number to 5,000 robots by the end of the year, in a bid to match elon musks plans for teslas general purpose robot optimus. earlier this month, the company hired luo jianlan, who previously worked at google x, alphabets moonshot factory, to lead its research efforts i hear about them when im talking with my robotics companies and theyre talking about competition theyre seeing in china, said aaron jacobson, partner at venture capital firm nea. this ones come up a few times now. prominent investor and ai expert kai-fu lee, who helped google and microsoft set up their outposts in china, founded an ai startup called 01.ai in 2022. it recently pivoted from training its own open source models to using deepseeks ai to build enterprise apps across areas like gaming, law and finance. the company has raised some 200 million at a 1 billion valuation, according to pitchbook. its one of chinas six tigers, an elite group of top ai companies in the country that includes the multimodal ai developer minimax ai and model maker moonshot ai, both of which have attracted investment from alibaba. chinas ai advances come as political relations with the u.s. grow ever more fraught. in 2022, then-president biden issued export controls on semiconductor companies, including crucial chipmakers like nvidia and amd, restricting sales of their most powerful hardware in the country, aimed at throttling chinas ai growth. now, a trade war has broken out between the two nations created by president trumps liberation day tariffs, with the u.s. imposing 125 duties on exports. this is the power of a centralized state that can say, were going to try to go in that direction. chinas gains in ai are driven in part by an emphasis on academic research and open source publishing at universities, russell wald, executive director of stanford universitys institute for human-centered artificial intelligence hai, told forbes. in 2018, china said it wanted to be the leader in ai by 2030, and marshaled significant academic resources toward that goal. now the country is producing most of the worlds ai research as of 2023, it accounted for about 70 of all granted patents and produced 23 of the worlds ai publications and citations. this is the power of a centralized state that can say, were going to try to go in that direction, wald said. the downside, however, is that censorship in ai models by the chinese government might put off western users, he added. so far the strategy is working. earlier this week, hai released its annual ai index, which shows the ai race between the u.s. and china narrowing. the u.s. is still producing most of the worlds cutting edge ai, with u.s. companies releasing 40 notable models, defined as particularly influential models within the aimachine learning ecosystem. china, in second place, released 15 such models. and the country is closing the gap in model performance two years ago, the u.s. led by double digit points on various benchmark tests. last year, china reached near parity, according to hai. the countrys open source approach, which lets anyone download the model and build applications with it, has made it easy for chinese companies to have global impact. for decades, the u.s. and china have had starkly different tech ecosystems, with products and services only available in one region or the other. but deepseeks success showed the ai community that chinese labs could circumvent those restrictions with open publishing. in the realm of open source releases, there is no such barrier, jeff boudier, head of product and growth at hugging face, told forbes. there is no great firewall. meanwhile, given the countrys strong cultivation of ai talent at its universities and support for rd, wald sees a lot of promise not just in deepseek and its current cohort, but what follows them. what i think is more interesting is the company you dont know about right now, and you might hear about a year or two from now.

  Title: US Commander Warns That China and North Korea's Military Aid to Russia Creates Risks in the Pacific
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-10 17:44:31)
  Content: washington ap the top u.s. commander in the pacific warned senators thursday that the military support china and north korea are giving russia in its war on ukraine is creating a security risk in his region as moscow provides critical military assistance to both in return. adm. samuel paparo, head of u.s. indo-pacific command, told the senate armed services committee that china has provided 70 of the machine tools and 90 of the legacy chips to russia to help moscow rebuild its war machine. in exchange, he said, china is potentially getting help in technologies to make its submarines move more quietly, along with other assistance. senators pressed paparo and gen. xavier brunson, commander of u.s. forces korea, on chinas advances in the region, including threats to taiwan. and they also questioned both on the u.s. military presence in south korea, and whether it should be shielded from personnel cuts. both said the current u.s. force there and across the indo-pacific is critical for both diplomacy in the region and americas national security, as ties between russia and china grow. the u.s. has 28,500 forces in south korea. paparo said north korea is sending thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of artillery shells and hundreds of short-range missiles to russia. the expectation, he said, is that pyongyang will get air defense and surface-to-air missile support. its a transactional symbiosis where each state fulfills the other states weakness to mutual benefit of each state, paparo said. in his opening comments, sen. roger wicker of mississippi, the republican committee chairman, said the greater alignment of russia, china and north korea should be of great concern to all in the west. this concern should then lead to action. if we are to maintain global peace and stability, we must continue taking steps now to rebuild our military and reestablish deterrence. brunson said north korea has shown the ability to send munitions and troops to russia while advancing development of its own military capabilities, including hypersonics. pyongrang, he said, boasts a russian-equipped, augmented, modernized military force of over 1.3 million personnel. north koreas efforts to develop advanced nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles pose a direct threat to our homeland and our allies, paparo added. north korea also has sent thousands of soldiers to fight with the russians against ukraine. and ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said wednesday that russia is actively recruiting chinese citizens to fight alongside its forces in the ukraine war. he said more than 150 such mercenaries are already active in the battle with beijings knowledge. china has called the accusation irresponsible. in other comments, sen. jack reed of rhode island, the ranking democrat on the panel, said observers fear that president donald trump will shrink the u.s. troop presence in korea and japan, reduce our military exercises with both nations, and scale back plans for our joint force headquarters in japan. any such actions, he said, will sow seeds of doubt about americas stability and trustworthiness. he also questioned whether recent moves by the pentagon to shift an aircraft carrier and patriot missile battalion from the pacific region to the middle east have hurt military readiness in the indo-pacific command. paparo said he owes the defense chief and the president constant vigilance on that matter, including a persistent awareness on whether those forces could get back to the pacific if there is suddenly a higher priority threat in his region. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
