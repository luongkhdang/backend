  Title: Tariff turmoil: How Tesla and other companies are dealing with the uncertainty of the trade war
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-23 22:23:02)
  Content: new york ap uncertainty over tariffs and an unpredictable trade war is weighing heavily on companies as they report their latest financial results and try to give investors financial forecasts. some tariffs remain in place against key u.s. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. the tariff and trade picture has been shifting for months, sometimes changing drastically on a daily basis. those shifts make it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales. on tuesday, treasury secretary scott bessent said he expects a de-escalation in the trade war between the u.s. and china, but cautioned that talks between the two sides had yet to formally start. heres how several big companies are dealing with the tariff confusion tesla tesla is in a better position than most car companies to deal with tariffs because it makes most of its u.s. cars domestically. but it still sources materials from other nations and will face import taxes. the bigger impact will be seen in the companys energy business. the company said the impact will be outsized because it sources lfp battery cells from china. the broader trade war could also hurt the company as china, the worlds largest electric vehicle market, retaliates against the u.s. tesla was forced earlier this month to stop taking orders from mainland customers for two models, its model s and model x. it makes the model y and model 3 for the chinese market at its factory in shanghai. ceo elon musk, an adviser to president donald trump, on tuesday reiterated that he believes lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity. but he added that ultimately the president decides on what tariffs to impose. akzo nobel the amsterdam-based maker of paints and coatings for industrial and commercial use said the big risk from tariffs could come in the form of lower demand for its products. the company said almost all sales of finished goods in the u.s. were locally produced, with the majority of raw materials locally sourced. over the years, we deliberately localized both our procurement and production in the u.s., said ceo gregoire poux-guillaume, in a conference call with analysts. we also largely run china for china and use the rest of asia instead as an export base. the companys products range from paints and coatings for the automotive industry to the do-it-yourself homeowner. broader tariffs could squeeze consumers and businesses and hurt sales. boston scientific the medical device maker said it expects most of the effecs of tariffs to hit the company during the second half of the year, but that it can absorb the impact. the company raised its earnings and revenue forecasts for the year, despite the tariffs. it estimates a 200 million impact from tariffs in 2025, but said it can offset that through higher sales and reductions in discretionary spending. the company said it has a long-standing supply chain around the globe and has made significant investments in the u.s. boeing boeing said much of its supply chain is in the u.s. and many of its imports from canada and mexico are exempt from tariffs under an existing trade agreement. the company does have suppliers in japan and italy, but it expects to recover those tariff costs. the net annual cost of higher tariffs on the supply chain is less than 500 million. a bigger concern is the potential for retaliatory tariffs, which could impact its ability to deliver aircraft. china, a key target for u.s. tariffs, has retaliated in part by no longer accepting deliveries of boeing aircraft. att att, like its peers in the telecommunications sector, faces higher costs for cellphones and other equipment. the company said it believes it can manage anticipated higher costs, based on the current pause in some tariffs and its supply chain. the magnitude of any increase will depend on a variety of factors, including how much of the tariffs the vendors pass on, the impact that the tariffs have on consumer and business demand, said ceo john stankey, on a conference call with analysts.

  Title: Is AppLovin Corporation (APP) Among the Best Guru Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts?
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-23 17:05:39)
  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. we recently published a list of 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. in this article, we are going to take a look at where applovin corporation nasdaqapp stands against other guru stocks to invest in. wall street seems to be breathing a little easier after the initial panic over president trumps tariffs earlier this month, but the rollercoaster is not over just yet. all three major indexes closed last week in the red, with the dow and nasdaq both dipping over 2, and the broader market down more than 1. even though markets remain closed on april 18 for good friday, the general consensus is that the worst of the trade war headlines might be dying down. marko papic, chief strategist of geomacro strategy at bca research, remains cautiously optimistic, noting that while the idea of president trump striking 90 trade deals in 90 days sounds ambitious, they will likely be small, symbolic wins that still help calm markets. that said, volatility is expected to continue, and papic predicts the broader market could dip again before bouncing back, potentially giving investors a buying opportunity. investors are deep in earnings season right now, and some of wall streets biggest banks have reported solid first-quarter results. a big part of their success came from their trading desks, which cashed in on the recent market volatility, especially in equities. however, despite strong numbers on paper, bank ceos remain cautious and are hesitant to make big moves right now because of the market uncertainty. the us dollar also just had its worst weekly performance since 2022. meanwhile, investors are playing it safe and rapidly buying bonds, which pushed the 10-year treasury yield down to around 4.28. while some investors are seeing the current market dip as a buying opportunity, daniel von ahlen from globaldata ts lombard says otherwise. he believes the risks of a recession are being seriously underestimated. even though trumps recent tariff halt gave markets a bit of a boost, ahlen thinks that bounce will not last. in his view, this is not the time to scoop up stocks on the cheap, he is actually advising people to sell into rallies and avoid the usual buy-the-dip strategy. ahlen suggests getting a bit more cautious and selective. instead of jumping into the whole market, he recommends focusing on defensive sectors, like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare, that tend to hold up better in downturns. the market uncertainty is reflected in etfs as well, which are often considered wiser investment options due to active management strategies and lower risk compared to individual investing. for example, the guru etf is down 8.30 year-to-date as of april 18. however, over the last 12 months, the fund has posted share price returns of 13.38. similarly, five-year share returns stand at an impressive 51.57. guru gives retail investors a way to tap into the top stock picks of major hedge funds at a relatively low 0.75 expense ratio. it offers a more affordable and flexible way to try and beat the broader market using expert insights. so, lets take a look at the best guru stocks to buy. a close-up of a mobile device, showing an advertiser reaching out to a consumer via a software-based platform. for this article, we looked up the guru etf, which had 82 holdings as of april 18. next, we manually searched for the average upside potential of each stock and selected 11 stocks with the highest values. the list below is ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of april 18. we have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment as of q4 2024. why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? the reason is simple our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. our quarterly newsletters strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4 since may 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points see more details here. number of hedge fund holders 95 average upside potential 95.66 applovin corporation nasdaqapp is a california-based tech company that allows advertisers to grow and monetize their content through software tools. the company connects advertisers with app publishers, runs real-time auctions to get the best ad placements, and provides data and insights to help improve marketing strategies. it also supports connected tv advertising and distributes streaming content. it is one of the best guru stocks to look out for. on april 11, ubs analyst chris kuntarich assigned a buy rating to applovin corporation nasdaqapp but reduced the price target to 450 from 630. ubs is still confident in the companys future, even after a short report raised some concerns and made e-commerce advertisers a bit more cautious. while first-quarter revenue might fall short of expectations, feedback on the companys performance has been positive. ubs believes applovins advertising business could grow by more than 40 annually over the next few years. applovin corporation nasdaqapp recorded 1.37 billion in q4 revenue, a 44 jump from last year, and 4.71 billion for the full year, up 43. most of that growth came from advertising, which surged 73, while app revenue dipped slightly. net income climbed a whopping 248 in q4 and 343 for the year. looking ahead, applovin expects q1 2025 revenue to reach up to 1.385 billion. it also repurchased 25.7 million shares in 2024, ending the year with 340 million shares outstanding. according to insider monkeys fourth quarter database, 95 hedge funds were bullish on applovin corporation nasdaqapp, up from 51 funds in the prior quarter. rajiv jains gqg partners was the largest stakeholder of the company, with 8.4 million shares worth 2.7 billion. overall, app ranks 8th among the 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. while we acknowledge the potential of app as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that ai stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. there is an ai stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular ai stocks lost around 25. if you are looking for an ai stock that is more promising than app but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest ai stock. read next 20 best ai stocks to buy now and 30 best stocks to buy now according to billionaires. disclosure none. this article is originally published at insider monkey.

  Source: abcnews.go.com (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights how the Montgomery County school board's decision to include LGBTQ-themed storybooks in the curriculum has brought the issue of parental rights and religious freedom to the forefront of public discourse. The article states, "starting in 2022, montgomery county - one of the most diverse counties in the country - introduced a series of lgbtq-themed storybooks for reading in elementary school classrooms under a statewide mandate to be more inclusive of the diversity of families and children attending the schools." This action has set the agenda for debate, forcing the Supreme Court to address the conflict between religious beliefs and inclusive education.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the Trump administration "moves to empower parents and root out diversity and inclusion initiatives across the u.s. education system." This suggests a broader political agenda at play.

and that the constitution does not guarantee students the right to skip lessons inconsistent with their beliefs. lower courts sided with the board. the justices will now take a closer look at whether the countys refusal to grant an opt-out to parents illegally burdens their religious rights. school districts nationwide are grappling with demands from parents to opt-out their children from lesson plans they claim are counter to religious beliefs. abc news the case is a good illustration of the fact that public schools are at ground zero in the culture wars, said jim walsh, a texas lawyer who represents school boards and is a member of the national school attorneys association. we all want the school to reflect our values, but we dont agree on our values. and certainly issues about same-sex marriage, the rights of lesbians and gays, are right at the center of that, he said. starting in 2022, montgomery county - one of the most diverse counties in the country - introduced a series of lgbtq-themed storybooks for reading in elementary school classrooms under a statewide mandate to be more inclusive of the diversity of families and children attending the schools. montgomery county, md., is at the center of a supreme court battle over lgbtq storybooks and some parents claims of a constitutional right to opt-out their children from readings. abc news the local school board, which closely consulted with educators in approving the curriculum, maintains that the books do not take a side on issues of gender or sexuality and that teachers are instructed not to teach or enforce any particular view. among the illustrated titles is uncle bobbys wedding by sarah brannen, about a young girl who worries her close relationship with a beloved uncle will change after he marries his male fiance. prince knight by daniel haack presents a fairy-tale narrative about a blossoming romance between the main characters after a dramatic rescue from a dragon. daniel haack is the author of prince knight, an illustrated childrens book featuring gay characters. abc news nothing in my book is any different than most fairy tales that have some sort of romance at the center of it, said haack. nothing different than sleeping beauty or cinderella or any of those. in the book intersection allies, a group of three sociologist authors set out to simplify complex ideas about identity, including what it means to be nonbinary. we wrote this to affirm kids who are left out of the stories that we often tell, said latoya council, one of the authors. this book is not saying that, you know, your child has to choose to be transgender. its saying respect someone who is trans and their ability to seek spaces that are comfortable for them. three sociologists and authors of the childrens book intersection allies chelsea johnson, latoya council, carolyn choi speak with abc news about their desire to simplify complex ideas about identity. abc news chelsea johnson, another of the books authors, insisted nothing in the text asks anyone to change their beliefs. schools and parents and communities are partners with each other and helping kids make sense of the world and we dont have to opt our kids out to do that. montgomery county guidelines advise educators to make the storybooks available for students to read on their own, to read aloud, or share in reading groups. teachers are instructed not to advance a particular viewpoint about sexuality or gender with respect to the characters. at first, during the 2022-2023 school year, the board allowed parents to opt-out their kids from any lessons involving the books, but it later changed course, denying any opt-outs. billy moges, a mother of 3 and devout christian, says she withdrew her children from montgomery county, md., public schools over administrators refusal to let them opt-out from the reading of storybooks involving lgbtq themes. abc news when i was in school, i was opted-out of sex ed because i wasnt ready, and my parents didnt feel it was appropriate for the teachers to talk about it, and it didnt hurt anyone, said billy moges, a mother of three and devout christian, who pulled her kids from montgomery county schools because of the books. the problem with some of these books, though, as well, is they were love stories, so it was not just exposure to lgbtq characters. these were love stories, said elkoshairi. school officials explained in court documents that administering an opt-out program became too cumbersome to manage, led to higher rates of student absenteeism, and was ultimately inconsistent with an educational mission of supporting all types of families. emily and sharon mcgowan of montgomery county, md., have a second and sixth-grader enrolled in public schools. abc news these books are representing the community that is surrounding these children, said emily mcgowan, who mothers second- and sixth-graders with her wife sharon in montgomery county. you cannot deny that we exist. we live here, our kids go to school here. the mcgowans say opt-outs over lgbtq stories harm the children whose family lives are represented in the books. the idea that 10 of their classmates get to get up and walk out because theres two mommies in this book - what is the message thats sent to our kid who has two mommies? said sharon mcgowan. that something is so offensive about this that they get to walk out and maybe they even get to go to the playground and have extra play time? nearly every state gives parents the ability to opt-out their children from sex education classes but opt-outs for lgbtq issues vary widely by community and are often decided by board members elected by local parents, walsh said. the supreme court is seen in washington, jan. 10, 2025. abc news we can all understand parents having strong feelings about when and how is my child going to be taught about sexual issues. so, there are more opt-outs about this than anything else. but if the supreme court rules in favor of the plaintiffs in this case, its not gonna stop with just sex and gender issues. it will cover a wide variety of things that parents may have objections to, he said. the case comes as the trump administration has vowed to give more control over education to local leaders and communities. but even in places where school boards are choosing to prioritize diversity, equity and inclusion in their curriculum - like montgomery county - some conservatives are still pushing to override policies. sarah brannen is the author of uncle bobbys wedding, an illustrated childrens book featuring a gay couple and their niece. abc news the school board has decided to disrupt the thinking of their children on an area that has long been understood as going to the core of parental authority for their children, on sex and gender, said will haun, a senior attorney at becket fund for religious liberty, which is representing the plaintiffs before the supreme court. in that area, the first amendment absolutely protects the parents. the democratic process is important, and thats where we debate curriculum, haun added, but here were talking about restoring an opt-out right, which is not a challenge to the curriculum. wael elkoshairi insists he harbors no ill will toward lgbtq families and says he isnt calling for a ban on any books. but he hopes the high court - as a matter of faith - will give parents greater control. wael elkosairi is among hundreds of montgomery county, md., parents of public school children hoping the u.s. supreme court will establish a constitutional right to opt-out of lessons that conflict with religious beliefs. abc news when people have differences of opinion on certain things, accommodations work well to relieve everybody, and we move on, elkosairi said. as for the mcgowans, they are hoping the courts conservative majority holds the line. the fact that the court took the case at all - i dont have reason to believe that they took the case to affirm the importance of inclusion in the public schools, said sharon mcgowan. if harm is done by their decision, we will figure out what we need to do at a personal and a community level to mitigate that harm. people walk past the u.s. supreme court, in washington, april 21, 2025. abc news a decision in the case is expected by the end of june.

  Title: Stock market rallies after closed-door remarks by Treasury Secretary Bessent - Fortune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 20:15:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The recurring mentions of 'Trump tariffs' and 'Trump policy changes' alongside discussions of corporate hits (RTX), market reactions ('volatility spike', 'markets open sharply higher'), and geopolitical shifts ('softens on china', 'china de-escalation') align with aspects of Political Economy theory. This perspective suggests that political decisions and the actions of key political figures (like Trump) are not merely isolated events but have direct, measurable consequences on economic actors (companies like RTX, markets) and international economic relations (China trade). The text provides evidence of this linkage by explicitly connecting policy actions (tariffs, changes) to economic outcomes (hits, market shifts).; Theories_and_interpretations: The juxtaposition of headlines about market reactions to political statements ('investors are finally taking trump seriously', 'markets open sharply higher after trump softens') and the mention of 'agenda-setting' in the context of financial news (implied by the focus on specific topics like tariffs, Fed Chair, China) could be viewed through the lens of Agenda-Setting Theory. While typically applied to media influence on public perception, here it highlights how the *focus* of political figures (Trump's statements on China, Powell) can directly influence the *agenda* of financial markets and news coverage, demonstrating the power of political rhetoric to shape economic attention and action, as evidenced by the immediate market response described.; Intriguing_angles: The text mentions 'doges staffing cuts' as a cause for the IRS's 'nightmare' tax season and potential refund delays. The term 'doges' is unusual in this context and lacks clear identification as a standard entity type (Organization, Government Agency). Its significance lies in being presented as a direct causal factor for a major government agency's operational failure, yet its nature remains undefined within the article. What entity or concept does 'doges' represent in this context, and why is it presented as a singular, impactful cause without further clarification?

premarket. federal reserve chairman jerome powell dismissed the possibility of a fed put in the near term while speaking in chicago on wednesday. we may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are in tension. if that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close, said powell. u.s. export restrictions on nvidia corp.s nvda h20 gpus pulled the stock market down on wednesday. the 10-year treasury bond yielded 4.32 and the

lower on wednesday, driven by a significant sell-off in the semiconductor sector and broader tech weakness. the ishares semiconductor etf soxx experienced a steep decline, with nvidia corp. and

at wells fargo, current equity levels offer an attractive entry opportunity even with the bounce higher off the recent lows. wren further emphasized the importance of having a plan of action or at least be happy with where you currently stand, regardless of individual perspectives on the implemented tariffs. over the course of the last couple of weeks, we have seen the administration go from an aggressive reciprocal tariff strategy that involved meaningful universal tariffs on virtually all of our trading partners to a pause that suspends most reciprocal tariffs but leaves a 145 levy on imports from china, wren notes. despite the tariff uncertainty, wrens firm maintains a view that the u.s. economy was already heading for a slowdown in the first half of the year, even before the current trade strategies were implemented. from our perspective, even before the current tariff strategies were deployed, our analysis suggested the economy was going to hit a bump in the road and slow in the first half of this year. that line of thought is still intact, wren states. wren also suggests a strategic shift in fixed income, advising investors to move money from bonds, specifically the intermediate portion of the yield curve, into mid-cap u.s. equities in an effort to take advantage of the fall in stocks and the rally in bond prices yields fell. meanwhile, the u.s. dollar is facing pressure, with its reserve currency status. a recent study titled dollar upheaval this time is different noted a 3.6 depreciation between april 4th and 14th, an unusual move as the dollar typically gains during global volatility. this suggests a break from traditional market behavior, raising concerns that u.s. treasuries lose their safe-haven appeal. if u.s. treasuries are no longer

  Title: US Stock Futures Slip Ahead Of 'Liberation Day' Tariffs Announcement: Expert Points To Uncertainty Amid Higher Risk Premia
  Source: www.benzinga.com (2025-04-02 09:54:21)
  Content: u.s. stock futures slipped on wednesday after a mixed session on tuesday. futures of major benchmark indices were lower in premarket trading. as the liberation day has arrived, traders will look for cues from president donald trumps reciprocal tariffs scheduled to be announced later today. the administration is reportedly considering a widespread 20 tariff that would affect a large portion of the 3 trillion in yearly imports, according to a washington post report. the 10-year treasury bond yielded 4.17 and the two-year bond was at 3.88. the cme groups fedwatch tool shows markets pricing in an 85.5 likelihood of the federal reserve maintaining current interest rates through its may meeting. futures change - dow jones -0.17 sp 500 -0.22 nasdaq 100 -0.29 russell 2000 -0.30 the spdr sp 500 etf trust spy and invesco qqq trust etf qqq, which track the sp 500 index and nasdaq 100 index, respectively, dropped in premarket on tuesday. the spy was down 0.25 to 559.58, while the qqq declined 0.34 to 471.10, according to benzinga pro data. cues from last session driven by gains in consumer discretionary, communication services, and information technology, the sp 500 closed slightly higher on tuesday, though overall u.s. stocks settled mixed. conversely, the health care and financial sectors experienced declines. this sector divergence occurred as investors anticipated the trump administrations upcoming tariff announcements. meanwhile, broader market indices reflected significant losses for march and the first quarter of the year the sp 500 saw its largest monthly drop since december 2022, falling 5.8, while the nasdaq and dow tumbled 8.2 and 4.2 respectively. quarterly, the nasdaq declined 10.4, the dow 1.3, and the sp 500 also recorded a loss. economic data revealed a decline in the ism manufacturing pmi, an increase in construction spending, and a decrease in job openings. index performance - value nasdaq composite 0.67 17,449.89 sp 500 0.38 5,633.07 dow jones -0.028 41,989.96 russell 2000 0.016 2,012.24 insights from analysts as investors await further direction on the economys outlook after trumps tariffs, jurrien timmer, the director of global macro at fidelity investments, in his recent note said that more uncertainty means higher risk premia. th refers to the additional return investors expect to receive for taking on a riskier investment compared to a risk-free investment. its essentially the reward for bearing greater uncertainty. he observes a significant shift in market sentiment, moving from confidence to doubt. he notes, markets continue to price in a possible left tail, with the sp 500 hovering at the -10 correction threshold. timmer distinguishes between sharp, swift drawdowns, like the 1998 ltcm crisis, and potential recession-driven corrections. market cycles that are priced for recessions that dont happen are the ones we want to rebalance into. however, he cautions that if fiscal austerity and trade tensions trigger a recession, we are likely not done correcting. the core-pce inflation rate near 3 further complicates matters, potentially limiting the feds support. while acknowledging the difficulty of predicting market movements in real time, he emphasizes the importance of analyzing the tape, sentiment, valuation, earnings estimates, and credit. while the market appears moderately oversold and sentiment is cautious, it doesnt indicate recessionary pricing, warranting further patience. regarding diversification, timmer points to the performance of international equities, treasuries, and gold. he also poses the crucial question whether the rotation out of the mag 7 is a bump along the road to continued ai and mega cap dominance, or the big one. he stresses that if a new secular regime is emerging, the game going forward will be all about the alpha instead of the beta, necessitating a wider asset allocation and lower equity return expectations. timmer also notes the historical occurrence of 10 drawdowns, stating the odds of being in a 10 drawdown have been around 40 for the sp 500, and that there is no clear historical pattern of what happens after a 10 decline. he also notes a similarity between the current market and the 1998 ltcm crisis, both catalyzed by an unwinding of crowded trades. according to eugenia mykuliak, the founder and executive director at b2prime group, tariffs can cause a disruption in global supply chains, which will lead businesses to reassess their supply routes. a recalibration of the supply chain will lead to capital outflows from emerging markets and increased market volatility, said mykuliak. see also how to trade futures upcoming economic data heres what investors will keep an eye on wednesday marchs adp employment data will

  Content: u.s. stock futures plummeted on thursday after advancing on wednesday. futures of major benchmark indices were down over 2-3 in premarket trading. invoking a 1977 law, president donald trump declared a trade emergency wednesday, arguing it was necessary to address the u.s.s large and persistent trade deficit. the white house released a fact sheet outlining the new reciprocal tariffs, which trump justified with the principle, treat us like we treat you. while canada and mexico were notably excluded from the tariff program, china, vietnam, cambodia, and sri lanka face the steepest increases under the new system. gold prices soared to a fresh record of 3,167.71 per ounce, and investors fled toward safe-haven assets. the 10-year treasury bond yielded 4.06 and the two-year bond was at 3.78. the cme groups fedwatch tool shows markets pricing in a 76.7 likelihood of the federal reserve maintaining current interest rates through its may meeting. futures change -

Historical Article 8 (ID: 129482):
  Title: Abu Dhabi Continues Building Big In Culture Push
  Source: finance.yahoo.com (2025-04-21 15:11:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Political Economy theory, the article demonstrates how direct political intervention, specifically President Trump's threats against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and pressure to cut rates, is presented as a primary driver of market instability. The text states the US dollar and treasuries are 'under pressure' and 'selling off' due to 'fallout from president trumps threats' and that risks to 'fed independence' put 'downward pressure on the confidence that foreign investors have'. This aligns with political economy perspectives where political actors' actions, even those targeting independent institutions, have immediate and tangible economic consequences, disrupting market confidence and asset values.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article heavily utilizes Agenda-Setting Theory by focusing on specific, curated topics and expert opinions presented as central to market movements. Phrases like 'stories driving the market action', 'stocks in focus this week', and repeated references to 'Jim Cramer's game plan' or lists like '12 AI stocks on wall streets radar' highlight how financial media and analysts select and emphasize certain narratives (political pressure on the Fed, specific tech stock performance, curated investment lists) to shape the perceived market agenda for investors. This suggests the article's structure is designed to direct reader attention to these specific points, potentially influencing their investment focus.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions 'uncertainty surrounding federal policy' contributing to businesses being 'priced for a significant slowdown... if not a recession'. However, it also notes that hopes for the 'new administrations pro-business approach swiftly gave way to tariff fears'. Textual Basis: These points appear in the paragraphs referencing investment letters from Heartland Advisors and Ariel Investments. Significance: The text presents both 'uncertainty' from federal policy and a 'pro-business approach' as factors, but then immediately links the 'pro-business approach' to 'tariff fears' that caused investors to 'fled to shelter'. This juxtaposition is intriguing because it suggests that the *specific nature* of the 'pro-business' policies (tariffs) was the source of the uncertainty and negative market reaction, potentially complicating or even contradicting a simple 'pro-business' label. Probing Question: How does the article reconcile the idea of a 'pro-business approach' with the simultaneous rise of 'tariff fears' and 'uncertainty surrounding federal policy' leading to recession pricing? Does the text imply certain 'pro-business' policies are inherently destabilizing for markets?

  Content: bloomberg the sp 500 index declined to the lowest level in 11 months, slashing 5.4 trillion in market value in just two sessions as federal reserve chairman jerome powell said the trump administrations tariffs could have a persistent impact on inflation. most read from bloomberg housing agency aims to relocate its dc headquarters metro-north is faster than acela on nyc-new haven route after signal updates local governments vie for fired federal workers what would transportation abundance look like? london clears final hurdle for more high-speed trains to europe the sp 500 closed 6 lower in its worst day since march 2020, with all but 14 members in the red. the nasdaq 100 plunged 6.1, entering a bear market. the swiftness of the gauges 20 drop from its february peak is rivaled only by the pandemic meltdown in 2020 and 2000s dot-com implosion. all 11 sectors in the sp 500 declined. nvidia corp. and apple inc. fell at least 7, while tesla inc. lost 10. speaking at the society for advancing business editing and publishing conference in arlington, virginia, powell said that economic impact of president donald trumps tariffs will likely be larger than expected. he also stressed the need for the fed to keep its inflation expectations anchored, which would indicate that interest rate hikes may not be imminent. earlier, trump pressured powell to cut rates now. the sp 500 has lost 11 the past two sessions in the steepest two-day slide since march 2020, when the covid pandemic pushed the global economy into lockdown. the market is bleeding and more pain is clearly coming as this escalating trade war risks pushing the us economy into a recession, luca paolini, chief strategist at pictet asset management said over the phone. its not a surprise china would retaliate. but this will inevitably cause a recession because the damage is done unless trump backs off. the rout came as china imposed a 34 tariff on all american imports starting april 10, in addition to targeted actions against poultry producers and weapons makers, according to the official xinhua news agency. the latest salvo in donald trumps trade war added to volatility thats been gripping global financial markets since the president announced the harshest tariffs in a century. trump, for his part, appears to be sticking to his guns, saying his economic policies will never change. the cboe volatility index soared to above 45 levels associated with some of the worst market turbulence in recent memory. treasuries continued to soar as investors sought safety, while a measure of credit risk spiked to the highest level since the regional banking crisis in march 2023. us job growth beat forecasts in march and the unemployment rate edged up, pointing to a healthy labor market before the economy gets hit by widespread tariffs. a good jobs report wont be enough to quell recession fears because its backward-looking and wont full give insight into how hard the economy will take a hit from the trade war, said scott ladner, chief investment officer at horizon investments. now, traders are boosting their expectations for the fed to cut interest rates this year. money markets are fully pricing four quarter-point reductions by year-end, with a more than 50 chance of a fifth up from just three cuts priced in before the levies were announced. that pushed us 10-year yields below 3.90 earlier in the session, the lowest since before election day. the sp 500 is down more than 17 from its february record after declining for six weeks in the past seven. fund managers yanked 4.7 billion out of us stocks in the week through april 2 in the second week of outflows, data compiled by epfr global and bank of america show. fridays losses follow trumps drastic new trade tariffs, which ignited widespread recession fears. the trade fight weighed hard on shares of energy and financial companies friday, including baker hughes co., which plunged 13, and insurer metlife inc. which fell 9. tech stocks also got hit. the philadelphia semiconductor index slid 7.6 following thursdays 9.9 loss, as micron technology inc. dropped 13 and marvell technology inc. lost more than 11. meanwhile, shares in companies that have large manufacturing operations in vietnam, including nike inc. and lululemon athletica inc., jumped after trump said he had a very productive call with the countrys leader. trump on wednesday imposed the steepest american tariffs in a century, saying he will apply a 10 tariff on all exports to the us, with even higher duties on some 60 nations, to counter large trade imbalances with the us. how bad will it get for the economy? with so much uncertainty swirling, stocks are selling off and thats signaling that investors see both economic and profit growth slowing because of the trade war, said adam sarhan, founder of 50 park investments. the equity rout now has wall streets biggest stock bull oppenheimers john stoltzfus rethinking his 7,100 price target on the sp 500, which is among the highest on wall street tracked by bloomberg and would imply a 25 gain through thursdays close. that comes as rbc capital marketss lori calvasina cut her price target on the index for a second time this year to 5,550 from 6,200, given a dimmer outlook for economic and profit growth. without a doubt, where were sitting here it is under review and has been under review for awhile, john stoltzfus said on bloomberg television friday. the reality has been until we got these rather surprising unpleasant levels of tariffs and the markets reaction, were naturally going to have to take a look and sharpen our pencils, so to speak. most read from bloomberg businessweek with shake shack in first class, airline food is no longer a joke indias destination weddings fuel a new tourist economy la fire victims are betting on a radical idea to help them rebuild china tells kids to study manufacturing to fill factory jobs trumps irs cuts are tempting taxpayers to cheat

  Content: u.s. stock futures declined on friday after a bloodbath on thursday following the introduction of president donald trumps tariffs. futures of major benchmark indices were lower in premarket trading. fueled by a broad market downturn, the dow jones plummeted by a staggering 1,679 points, its fifth-largest drop ever, while the sp 500 and nasdaq suffered their biggest single-day losses since june and march 2020, respectively. trump, however, dismissed the tariff-induced selloff and said, the market is going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom. the 10-year treasury bond yielded 3.94 and the two-year bond was at 3.61. the cme groups fedwatch tool shows markets pricing in a 69.4 likelihood of the federal reserve maintaining current interest rates

nvidia corp. nvda also saw a significant drop, tumbling 7.8, while amazon.com inc. amzn shares fell by 8.98. across the broader market, consumer discretionary, energy, and information technology stocks registered the most substantial losses within the sp 500. in contrast, consumer staples stocks stood out, bucking the prevailing negative trend and closing the session higher. this sectors resilience was highlighted by lamb weston holdings inc. lw, whose shares surged 10 after the company released third-quarter financial results that exceeded expectations and provided fy25 sales guidance above analyst estimates. economic data released thursday presented a mixed picture. u.s. initial jobless claims decreased by 6,000 to 219,000 for the week ending march 29, falling below the anticipated 225,000. additionally, the u.s. trade deficit narrowed to 122.7 billion in february, improving from 130.7 billion in january and slightly better than the forecasted 123.5 billion. however,

v. anti-tariff. its about accomplishing whats good for our country while not having a smoot-hawley situation. the smoot-hawley tariff act, enacted in 1930, was a us law that significantly increased tariffs on imported goods, intended to protect american businesses and farmers, but ultimately worsened the great depression by triggering a global trade war. however, he added that tariff-induced selloff on thursday was 100 smoot hawley disguised as thoughtful policy. the market was right to go down. it is not pro-tariff v. anti-tariff. its about accomplishing whats good for our country while

  Title: US Stocks Push Higher After Bessent’s Remarks: Markets Wrap - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 16:13:42)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article's emphasis on market reactions immediately following reports of potential policy shifts ('SP 500 rose... after bloomberg news reported closed-door comments') suggests that the *reporting* of information, even from private sources, is framed as a primary driver of financial sentiment. This highlights how media focus can influence what investors perceive as the most critical factors (trade tensions, Fed policy), potentially shaping market behavior based on perceived importance rather than solely on concrete economic fundamentals.; Theories_and_interpretations: The description of President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve ('berated powell for being slow to cut interest rates', 'concerns that trump may be preparing to fire powell') and the subsequent market 'reappraisal' of havens ('Trumps policies and his broadsides against the Fed have forced a reappraisal of the dollar and treasuries') aligns with aspects of Political Business Cycle theory. This perspective suggests that political actors may seek to influence monetary policy for short-term gains, and the market's reaction indicates a recognition of potential political interference impacting institutional independence and financial stability perceptions.

  Title: Tariff fallout in focus after stocks' worst week since 2020: What to know this week - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-06 11:38:45)
  Content: stocks just had their worst week since a global pandemic brought the world economy to a halt in march 2020. president trumps shocking tariff announcements on wednesday rattled markets ahead of the next days trading session. then, chinas announcement of reciprocal tariffs sent stocks further lower on friday. for the week, the dow jones industrial average dji pulled back almost 8, or about 3,300 points, to enter into correction territory. meanwhile, the sp 500 gspc sank roughly 9 as the broad-based benchmark approached a 20 drawback from its most recent all-time high. the tech-heavy nasdaq composite ixic led the losses, cratering 10 and ending in a bear market as its officially down 20 from its most recent all-time high. in the week ahead, investors will watch for updates on the status of tariff negotiations with other nations, as well as announcements of reciprocal tariffs on the us. trumps first round of 10 baseline tariffs is set to go into effect on april 5, and other wide-ranging additional tariffs are set to take hold on april 9. in other news, big bank earnings slated for friday will mark the unofficial start to first quarter earnings season. jpmorgan jpm, blackrock blk, wells fargo, wfc, and morgan stanley ms are all set to release results. delta dal and constellation brands stz will report on wednesday. in economic data releases, the consumer price index cpi on thursday is set to headline the week, with other releases on producer prices and consumer sentiment also in focus. one key question on investors minds is whether the stock market rout is over. wall street strategists have warned retaliatory tariffs would likely intensify the selling. if high tariff rates stay in place, negotiations are drawn out over a multi-month period and additional measures are taken with key trading partners, the risk of a recessionour bear case is likely to rise more materially, morgan stanley chief investment officer mike wilson wrote in a note to clients on thursday night. wilsons bear case projects the sp 500 to end at 4,600, a level not seen on the benchmark index since december 2023. market experts have pointed out that the tariff retaliation fallout likely isnt over. rsm chief economist joe brusuelas pointed out to yahoo finance that the european union, one of the uss largest trading partners, hasnt directly responded to the us tariffs yet. brusuelas argued the market doesnt have that priced in. investors fundamentally think this is just a repeat of 2018, brusuelas said. so theres a lot more damage that could go on here. with trump holding steady on his policy stance for now, investors have moved quickly to price in more fed interest rate cuts for this year. the moves come as economists have argued the risks of recession are rising as the tariffs stand to sharply hinder economic growth, and the broad-based equity market sell-off is proving to be an increasing risk to the health of the us economy. but on friday, fed chair jerome powell made no such concessions. its just too soon to say what the appropriate monetary policy response will be to these new policies, powell said. it is just too soon to say. we cant say with any confidence today. powell added that tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation and that its also possible that the effects could be more persistent. another key inflation reading for the fed will come on thursday with marchs consumer price index. wall street expects an annual gain of 2.6 for headline cpi, which includes the price of food and energy, down from 2.8. prices are set to rise 0.3 on a month-over-month basis, up from 0.2 in february. on a core basis, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, inflation is expected to have risen 3 year over year, a slowdown from the 3.1 increase seen in february. monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3 after falling more than 0.1 typically, a drop in inflation would be a welcome sign for markets. but in the current market moment headlined by uncertainty about whats to come, it might not be enough. the abrupt change in u.s. trade policy this week will make the march cpi feel like old news when it is released on thursday, wells fargos team of economists led by jay bryson wrote in a note to clients on friday. even as we forecast headline cpi to come in flat month-over-month in march, the looming effects of higher tariffs looks to throw a wrench in the fight against inflation. for all of two trading days, it looked like the initial public offering ipo market was reopening. shares of conservative news network newsmax nmax soared more than 1,000 in its first few trading days. ai software play coreweave crwv spiked 41 on tuesday. then trumps tariffs sent markets into a tailspin. multiple companies that had recently announced theyd be filing for an ipo are now backing off those plans. on friday, ticket platform stubhub delayed its road show presentations slated for next week, according to a report from the wall street journal. axios reported exchange platform etoro etto.pvt also halted its ipo plans. meanwhile, digital payments firm klarna klar.pvt, fintech company chime chim.pvt, and ad tech company mntn also reportedly hit the pause button. a crucial earnings season is set to kick off this week. amid all the policy uncertainty, the underlying question for investors has been just how badly trumps widespread tariffs will impact corporate profits. given this, what companies say about their outlooks for the rest of 2025 will be in particular focus. companies will be reporting first quarter earnings, which largely wont include the impact of any new trump policies. still, analysts have slashed their estimates for the first quarter by 4.2, per factset. thats higher than the five-year average of 3.3 and 10-year average of 3.2. still, consensus expects the sp 500 to grow earnings by 7 year over year in the first quarter and by 11.3 in 2025. that number is likely to come down. analysts often cut earnings estimates as the year goes on. but the big question from investors is just how far those estimates will come down and how different the chart below will look in a months time. economic data no notable economic releases. earnings dave busters play, levis levi economic data nfib small

  Title: Higher inflation, shaky markets: What to expect from Trump's tariff policies, according to economists
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-03 23:47:12)
  Content: economists, market watchers and consumers alike are still trying to understand the implications of president donald trumps announcement on wednesday of sweeping new tariffs. the plan, part of trumps make america wealthy again initiatives, features a baseline 10 tariff on all u.s. trading partners as well as duties as high as 50 on nations with which the u.s. has a trade deficit. imports from china, south korea and japan, for instance, face 34, 25 and 24 tariffs, respectively. products from the european union will come with a 20 levy. reaction from investors was swift. the sp 500 a proxy for the broad u.s. stock market ended thursdays session down 4.8 and now sits more than 12 below its february high. market watchers chief worry economic turmoil. should other countries respond to trumps tariff hikes by raising duties of their own, an escalating conflict could evolve into a trade war, which economists say could slow global economic growth. and because tariffs are collected from importing companies, economic experts say u.s.-based firms who use foreign goods will likely pass at least some of the tariff costs along to customers a move which could reignite inflation. heres what economists and market experts say to expect. should tariffs stay at the recently announced levels, the average rate on all u.s. imports would climb to 18.8, up from 2.5 in 2024, according to estimates from the tax foundation. but just because u.s. businesses are facing higher costs on imports doesnt mean that theyll pass a commensurate cost along to consumers. consumers are unlikely to feel the entire brunt of the increases, especially since businesses are aware that their customers already feel financially stretched, jeffrey roach, chief economist for lpl financial, recently told cnbc make it. in a weakening economy in general, consumers are going to be very sensitive to price changes, he said. i think corporations are going to say, were going to eat some of this, and maybe not be able to pass along as much as they might think. still, expect some prices to rise at least in the near term. higher tariffs will likely cause 3 to 5 more inflation over the next year and a half than the u.s. would have had without them, says bill adams, chief economist for comerica bank. with inflation currently sitting at 2.8 year-over-year, that could mean a 2 percentage point rise this year to 4.8 followed by a 1 point rise next year, on the low end, he says. and while reheating inflation could stress the economy, adams and other economists believe theres still room for growth, even with some headwinds. a recession over the next 12 months looks more likely than it looked at the start of the year, but we still think the economy will most likely expand in 2025, and 2026 in particular, because it looks likely that the administration will use tax revenues from tariffs to partially fund broader tax cuts that will come into effect next year, adams says. an old wall street truism says that markets hate nothing more than uncertainty. and even though investors got their answer on what tariffs the administration would install, big questions remain about how those tariffs might evolve over time, including possible higher tariffs from other countries. while the dust settles, markets are going to be kind of jittery, says scott helfstein, head of investment strategy at global x. its maybe a little lower from here, maybe a little higher from here, but largely sideways as we absorb the news from yesterday. among the questions investors will still be looking for answers to will tariffs stay in place at current levels? some market experts dont think so. we would expect tariffs to be reduced from the levels announced by the president, mark haefele, chief investment officer at ubs global wealth management, wrote in a recent note. the president himself invited negotiations, and treasury secretary scott bessent said in a bloomberg interview that the announced tariffs are the high end of the number and that countries could take steps to bring tariffs down. dont expect them to shrink significantly, however. when asked if trump could reverse course, or if this was perhaps a negotiation tactic, u.s. commerce secretary howard lutnick was firm in his denial. i dont think theres any chance, he said in a cnn interview. this is the reordering of global trade, right? thats whats going to happen. some trading partners may not take kindly to those tactics, and some have already have already responded with tariff measures of their own. china and the eu, for instance, have already announced plans for economic countermeasures. overall, though, the economy was heading into the tariff announcement having shown some signs of fundamental strength, including a resilient job market and encouraging corporate earnings, helfstein says. even if things are shaky over the short term, themes that were expected to drive growth in the market over the long run such as gains in ai and automation remain intact, he adds. investors may just have to wait while companies sort through tariff-related business strategies. those trends are going to continue just maybe on a slightly different pathway. want to earn some extra money on the side?

  Title: Wall Street rallies and recovers all of Monday’s slide as the dollar and US bond market steady
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-23 00:23:31)
  Content: new york ap u.s. stocks are rallying tuesday after companies reported fatter profits than expected, and other u.s. investments are also steadying a day after falling sharply on worries about president donald trumps trade war and his attacks on the head of the federal reserve. the sp 500 was 2.8 higher in afternoon trading. the dow jones industrial average was up 1,071 points, or 2.8, as of 1224 p.m. eastern time, and the nasdaq composite was 3.3 higher. every major index has so far recovered from their sharp drop on monday. the value of the u.s. dollar also stabilized after sliding against the euro and other competitors, while treasury yields held steadier. sharp, unusual moves in those markets have recently raised worries that trumps policies are making investors more skeptical that u.s. investments still deserve their reputations as the worlds safest. the only prediction many wall street strategists are willing to make is that financial markets will continue to jerk up and down as hopes rise and fall that trump may negotiate deals with other countries to lower his tariffs. otherwise, many investors expect the economy to fall into a recession. the international monetary fund on tuesday slashed its forecast for global economic growth this year to 2.8, down from 3.3. but vice president jd vance also said he made progress with indias prime minister, narendra modi, on trade talks monday. some signs of nervousness remain in financial markets. gold continued to rise, for example, as it holds onto its reputation as a safer investment when fear is dominating markets. a suite of better-than-expected profit reports from big u.s. companies, meanwhile, drove u.s. stocks higher. equifax jumped 14.5 after reporting better profit for the first three months of 2025 than analysts expected. it also said it would send more cash to its shareholders by increasing its dividend and buying up to 3 billion of its stock over the next four years. 3m climbed 8.1 after the maker of scotch tape and command strips said it made more in profit from each 1 of revenue during the start of the year than it expected. the company also stood by its forecast for profit for the full year, though it said tariffs may drag down its earnings per share by up to 40 cents per share. homebuilder pultegroup rose 8.2 after it likewise delivered a stronger profit for the start of 2025 than analysts expected. its been benefiting from the sharp moves in the bond market. the unusual drops for treasury yields recently are translating into lower rates for mortgages for potential customers. the drops for stock prices that are happening at the same time, though, are likely also scaring potential buyers. ceo ryan marshall said buyers remain caught between a strong desire for homeownership and the affordability challenges of high selling prices and monthly payments that are stretched. tesla rose 6.5 ahead of its earnings report, which is scheduled to arrive after trading ends for the day. that trimmed its loss for the year so far roughly 40. elon musks electric car company has already reported its first-quarter car sales dropped by 13 from the year before. its been hurt by vandalism, widespread protests and calls for a consumer boycott amid a backlash to musks high-profile role in the white house overseeing a cost-cutting purge of u.s. government agencies. stocks also showed how trumps tariffs could create winners and losers in a remade global economy. first solar jumped 12.6 after the u.s. department of commerce finalized harsher-than-expected solar tariffs on some southeast asian communities. defense contractors had some of the markets sharpest losses after rtx said u.s. tariffs on mexican and canadian imports, along with other products, could mean an 850 million hit to its profit this year. rtx, which builds airplane engines and military equipment, fell 8.7 even though it reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter. kimberly-clark lost 1.8 even though the maker of huggies and kleenex likewise reported a better-than-expected profit. ceo mike hsu said that the current environment will now mean greater costs across our global supply chain versus what it expected at the start of the year, and the company lowered its forecast for an underlying measure of profit this year. in the bond market, the yield on the 10-year treasury eased to 4.38 from 4.42 late monday. in stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in modest moves across europe and asia. ___ ap business writers yuri kageyama and matt ott contributed.

wall street, the nasdaq broke a record with its largest single-day point drop in the markets 50-year history as investors responded to president donald trumps tariff plan. both the nasdaq and dow jones suffered their worst days since march 2020 amid the covid-19 pandemic. the dow fell 1,679 points, which ranks in the top five for most points lost in a single day. the nasdaq fell 1,050 points for its largest one-day drop. the drop happened as investors got spooked over the potential impact from president donald trumps tariff plan and fears it could spark a global trade war. trump has said the policy is necessary to level the playing field for american manufacturers. however, many economists have warned his plan could have a negative impact on the economy as tariffs are expected to raise prices. despite thursdays historically bad day, some analysts believed it could have been worse. markets may actually be underreacting, especially if these rates turn out to be final, given the potential knock-on effects to global consumption and trade, sean sun, portfolio manager at thornburg investment management, told the associated press. but trump remained confident. the markets are going to boom, the president predicted outside the white house thursday. the country is going to boom. against the backdrop of sliding markets thursday, white house officials defended the new tariffs. today, the world starts taking us seriously. our workforce will finally be treated fairly, commerce secretary howard lutnick said in a statement. hours earlier he told cnn the world should stop exploiting the united states. treasury secretary scott bessent issued a statement the presidents historic actions will level the playing field for american workers and usher in a new age of economic strength. but former treasury secretary under bill clinton, larry h. summers, said he would have left his post if such a plan was unveiled. if any administration of which i was a part had launched an economic policy so totally ungrounded in serious analysis or so dangerous and damaging, i would have resigned in protest, he wrote thursday on x. while announcing his sweeping plan, trump vowed to usher in a golden age for america. but thursdays stock market lacked any of that luster. major companies including restaurant chains, retailers, and tech giants that rely on products from around the globe saw their stocks decline as they brace for supply chain disruptions. starbucks ended the day down 11 percent while chipotle fell nearly 4 percent. shares gap tanked 20 percent and macys dropped almost 14 percent. apple plunged more than 9 percent while amazon dipped nearly the same amount. some automakers also endured a rough day as trumps 25 percent tariff on imported cars took effect. tesla stock dropped almost 6 percent and stellantis, parent company of jeep, chrysler, and dodge, slid nearly 10 percent. stellantis announced thursday it was halting production at its factories in mexico and canada. about 900 u.s. employees are expected to be laid off, the automaker said thursday. meanwhile, investors seemed to have found some solace in comfort foods. french fry producer lamb weston gained 10 percent while general mills, coca-cola and kraft heinz each gained nearly 3 percent. thursdays market plunge didnt seem to ease fears that trumps liberation day could dwindle retirement funds tied to the stock markets. georgia taylor, founder of tailored wealth, told the financial times those near retirement must monitor their pensions closely. withdrawing during market downturns can deplete funds faster, so seeking advice on a flexible withdrawal strategy is crucial. this highlights the growing need for financial planning to make pensions last longer. the effect on the retirement savings will depend on the years a person has left until retirement, maggie switek, senior director on the research team at the milken institute, told the independent. for young adults, with a longer time horizon left until retirement, the effects may be offset by future changes in the market, with the stock markets trending upward over longer periods of time. hedge fund manager bradley wickens predicted thursday was just the beginning of a long road ahead for the fallout of trumps tariff plan. he told the wall street journal the true nature of how negative this is is going to take time to manifest itself during april and may, as it all dawns on everyone that, wow, these tariffs are here for a long time. the final impact of trumps plan is still to be determined as companies and other countries determine their response. european commission president ursula von der leyen called trumps decision a major blow to the global economy, adding we are now preparing for further countermeasures, to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail. canadian prime minister mark carney announced that his country plans to match the u.s.s 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles we take these measures reluctantly. and we take them in ways that is intended and will cause maximum impact in the united states and minimum impact in canada. in the face of tariff panic and market turbulence, asked how he thought things were going, trump replied i think its going very well. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their

  Title: Wall Street rallies and recovers most of Monday’s slide as the dollar and US bond market steady
  Source: www.chicagotribune.com (2025-04-22 16:20:16)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Political Economy theory, the article demonstrates how state actions, specifically President Trump's trade war and attacks on the Federal Reserve, directly influence market behavior and investor sentiment. The text states, 'worries about president donald trumps trade war and his attacks on the head of the federal reserve' led to market falls, and 'trumps policies are making investors more skeptical'. This illustrates the state's significant, and sometimes disruptive, role in shaping economic outcomes beyond traditional market forces.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article's structure aligns with aspects of Agenda-Setting Theory by prioritizing corporate earnings reports and stock market movements as the primary indicators of economic health. Phrases like 'u.s. stocks are rallying tuesday after companies reported fatter profits' and 'a suite of better-than-expected profit reports... drove u.s. stocks higher' place market performance at the forefront. This framing directs the reader's attention to these specific metrics, potentially influencing their perception of the overall economic situation based on market fluctuations rather than a broader set of economic indicators.; Intriguing_angles: The article notes Tesla's sales drop and then adds that it's been 'hurt by vandalism, widespread protests and calls for a consumer boycott amid a backlash to musks high-profile role in the white house overseeing a cost-cutting purge of u.s. government agencies.' Basis: This sentence explicitly links Elon Musk's political activities and public backlash to negative business consequences for Tesla. Significance: While other companies' performance is linked to market conditions or tariffs, Tesla's challenges are uniquely tied to its CEO's political profile and public reaction. This suggests that political alignment and public perception of a leader can be presented as significant factors impacting corporate performance, potentially highlighting a specific narrative about the consequences of business leaders engaging in controversial political actions. Probing Question: Why is the political dimension of Tesla's challenges highlighted so specifically compared to other companies mentioned? Does this detail serve to reinforce a particular view on the intersection of business leadership and politics?; Intriguing_angles: Several companies (3M, Kimberly-Clark, RTX) report better-than-expected recent profits but simultaneously warn of negative impacts from tariffs or increased costs due to the 'current environment'. Basis: 3M mentions tariffs may 'drag down its earnings per share', Kimberly-Clark notes 'greater costs' and lowered its forecast, and RTX cites tariffs for a potential '$850 million hit'. Significance: This juxtaposition presents a short-term positive (recent profit) alongside a longer-term negative outlook attributed to policy impacts. It suggests that the immediate market reaction to earnings might not fully capture the anticipated future costs or challenges stemming from trade policies, potentially creating a nuanced or even contradictory picture of corporate health. Probing Question: How might the article's presentation of strong recent profits alongside warnings about future tariff impacts influence investor or public understanding of the true economic stability of these companies? Does this framing prioritize immediate market signals over anticipated policy consequences?

  Title: The Stock Market Pain Is Just Getting Started. ‘This is How You Sabotage the World’s Economic Engine.’
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 21:53:27)
  Content: april 02, 2025, 548 pm edt the stock market was slumping after president donald trump made his tariff announcement. to state the obvious, it was worse than investors feared and now they need to figure out what it means for stocks over the rest of 2025. on wednesday, president donald trump announced reciprocal tariffs at his liberation day event in the white house rose garden. according to the president, a minimum baseline tariff of 10 will be imposed on everyone, but additional reciprocal tariffs will be imposed as well on select countries. the new tariffs appear to be in addition to those announced on automotive imports and on china. car imports are going to be taxed at 25, as expected. the spdr sp 500 exchange-traded fund was down 2.2 in after-hours trading. the reciprocal tariffs and the 10 baseline levy seem to have caused the drop. the roundhill magnificent seven etf was down 2.4. president trump just finished his tariff speech at the white house and we would characterize this slate of tariffs as worse than the worst case scenario the street was fearing, writes wedbush analyst dan ives. - scroll to continue there is some reason for hope. the sp 500 spx0.67 is down about 8 from recent highs, reflecting a lot of bad news. if things can turn around on thursday, investors should watch the 5750 level in a rally. getting through that would certainly support the thesis that the worst of the correction is over, says jason browne, president of texas-based investment advisory firm alexis investment partners. hes optimistic that wednesday means the market will move past peak uncertainty. but the downside looms as well, with 5500 perhaps the next support level. if nothing else, the announcement means that volatility will continue, says venu krishna, barclays head of u.s. equity strategy. after tariffs, there are still questions about retaliation, inflation, consumer spending, and industrial production. krishna recently cut his 2025 earnings estimates for the sp 500 spx0.67 from 271 to 262, and monitoring scenarios that could wipe out 2025 earnings growth. krishna is staying positive on big tech stocks, though. pe ratios for apple aapl0.31, amazon.com, alphabet, meta platforms meta-0.35, microsoft, and nvidia nvda0.25 have fallen to about 24 times earnings, down 25 from a recent peak of 32 times, making the sector a good place to hide. tech earnings will continue to grow and where else would you want to hide if things go wrong? krishna asks rhetorically. - scroll to continue theyre not doing so well in after-hours trading, however. apple was down 6.1, amazon.com was off 5.1, alphabet had declined 3.3, had fallen 4.6, microsoft had dipped 2, nvidia had dropped 4.9, and tesla had slumped 5.8. sector rotation aside, some on wall street sound cautiously optimistic despite the late wednesday dip. we would be wary of complete risk-off or go to cash approaches that constrain future growth participation, says arnim holzer, global macro strategist at easterly eab risk solutions. still, the chances that something goes very wrong are high, as holzer acknowledges. this was a manufactured crisis, he says, one that means it can be resolved quicklyor get worse. reciprocal tariffs leave room for negotiations, but also for more pain and uncertainty to come, according to adam hetts, global head of multi-asset at janus henderson investors. eye-watering tariffs on a country-by-country basis scream negotiation tactic, which will keep markets on edge for the foreseeable future , he writes. weve seen the administration have a surprisingly high tolerance for market pain, now the big question is how much tolerance it has for true economic pain as negotiations unfold. so far, the pain has been contained to the sentiment indicators, chances are they wont stay that way. this is how you sabotage the worlds economic engine while claiming to supercharge it, writes nigel green, ceo of devere group. trump is blowing up the post-war system that made the u.s. and the world more prosperous, and hes doing it with reckless confidence. something that seems to be lacking right now. - scroll to continue write to al root at allen.rootdowjones.comexternal link

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
