  Title: Tariff turmoil: How Tesla and other companies are dealing with the uncertainty of the trade war
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-23 22:23:02)
  Content: new york ap uncertainty over tariffs and an unpredictable trade war is weighing heavily on companies as they report their latest financial results and try to give investors financial forecasts. some tariffs remain in place against key u.s. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. the tariff and trade picture has been shifting for months, sometimes changing drastically on a daily basis. those shifts make it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales. on tuesday, treasury secretary scott bessent said he expects a de-escalation in the trade war between the u.s. and china, but cautioned that talks between the two sides had yet to formally start. heres how several big companies are dealing with the tariff confusion tesla tesla is in a better position than most car companies to deal with tariffs because it makes most of its u.s. cars domestically. but it still sources materials from other nations and will face import taxes. the bigger impact will be seen in the companys energy business. the company said the impact will be outsized because it sources lfp battery cells from china. the broader trade war could also hurt the company as china, the worlds largest electric vehicle market, retaliates against the u.s. tesla was forced earlier this month to stop taking orders from mainland customers for two models, its model s and model x. it makes the model y and model 3 for the chinese market at its factory in shanghai. ceo elon musk, an adviser to president donald trump, on tuesday reiterated that he believes lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity. but he added that ultimately the president decides on what tariffs to impose. akzo nobel the amsterdam-based maker of paints and coatings for industrial and commercial use said the big risk from tariffs could come in the form of lower demand for its products. the company said almost all sales of finished goods in the u.s. were locally produced, with the majority of raw materials locally sourced. over the years, we deliberately localized both our procurement and production in the u.s., said ceo gregoire poux-guillaume, in a conference call with analysts. we also largely run china for china and use the rest of asia instead as an export base. the companys products range from paints and coatings for the automotive industry to the do-it-yourself homeowner. broader tariffs could squeeze consumers and businesses and hurt sales. boston scientific the medical device maker said it expects most of the effecs of tariffs to hit the company during the second half of the year, but that it can absorb the impact. the company raised its earnings and revenue forecasts for the year, despite the tariffs. it estimates a 200 million impact from tariffs in 2025, but said it can offset that through higher sales and reductions in discretionary spending. the company said it has a long-standing supply chain around the globe and has made significant investments in the u.s. boeing boeing said much of its supply chain is in the u.s. and many of its imports from canada and mexico are exempt from tariffs under an existing trade agreement. the company does have suppliers in japan and italy, but it expects to recover those tariff costs. the net annual cost of higher tariffs on the supply chain is less than 500 million. a bigger concern is the potential for retaliatory tariffs, which could impact its ability to deliver aircraft. china, a key target for u.s. tariffs, has retaliated in part by no longer accepting deliveries of boeing aircraft. att att, like its peers in the telecommunications sector, faces higher costs for cellphones and other equipment. the company said it believes it can manage anticipated higher costs, based on the current pause in some tariffs and its supply chain. the magnitude of any increase will depend on a variety of factors, including how much of the tariffs the vendors pass on, the impact that the tariffs have on consumer and business demand, said ceo john stankey, on a conference call with analysts.

  Title: Pope Francis’ conservative critics had a unique way to oppose him: a retired pontiff
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-22 16:36:55)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article highlights how Pope Francis's critics actively worked to shape the narrative surrounding his papacy, using various platforms like social media and conferences. 'From individual protests to social media campaigns, conferences and petitions, conservatives made clear they believed themselves to be more catholic than the pope and forged unusually vocal resistance to his authority.' This demonstrates an attempt to influence public perception and potentially sway future papal elections.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Francis's tolerance of right-wing opposition, even seeming to 'relish in the criticism as evidence of how far a church obsessed with rules and regulations had strayed from jesus gospel-mandated call.' This raises the question: Was this tolerance genuine, or a calculated strategy to highlight the perceived rigidity of his opposition and further legitimize his reforms?

  Content: vatican city ap as amazonian bishops gathered at the vatican on oct. 21, 2019, a man entered a nearby church after dawn and stole three indigenous statues brought to rome for the occasion. he threw them into the tiber river in a videotaped protest to denounce what he called the pagan idolatry taking place on pope francis watch. the incident underscored the lengths to which pope francis traditionalist critics were willing to go to vent their opposition to historys first latin american pope. from individual protests to social media campaigns, conferences and petitions, conservatives made clear they believed themselves to be more catholic than the pope and forged unusually vocal resistance to his authority. their token leaders in the college of cardinals will likely be maneuvering to ensure someone more sympathetic to their sensibilities will be elected to replace francis, who died monday at 88. some wanted me dead every pope has his critics. and francis probably expected he would face opposition to his radical reform agenda after catholics for two generations grew used to more conservative popes. some wanted me dead, he quipped once after he heard some prelates in rome had started plotting a future conclave while he was in the hospital. francis critics were unique in having a living alternate as a point of reference, pope benedict xvi, who resided as pope emeritus in the vatican gardens for the first decade of francis pontificate. such an anomaly made the dynamics of the francis opposition a historical first. it exacerbated divisions that experts say must be addressed before another pope decides to step down. they say norms are necessary to prevent a retired pope from being an inspiration for the faithful in ways that discredit his successor or impact his leadership. francis tolerated the right-wing opposition for a while, often responding to their attacks with silence. at times, he even seemed to relish in the criticism as evidence of how far a church obsessed with rules and regulations had strayed from jesus gospel-mandated call to welcome the stranger, feed the poor and show mercy to all. its an honor if the americans attack me, he once said, referring to the u.s.-based nexus of opposition. after benedicts death in 2022, francis tried to blunt the opposition and consolidate his progressive reforms, even though it seemed the right-wing knives were out for him. within days of benedicts funeral, his longtime secretary published a tell-all memoir highly critical of francis. it also emerged posthumously that cardinal george pell wrote a devastating memo that circulated anonymously, calling francis pontificate a catastrophe. while saying he welcomed criticism, francis tried to neutralize the opposition through key appointments and targeted removals, even while trying to make the church a welcoming field hospital for wounded souls, especially lgbtq catholics. after one gesture of outreach francis approved blessings for same-sex couples african bishops united in disapproval in a remarkable continent-wide dissent to a papal directive. if you look at all the history of the reform of the church, where you have the strongest resistance or debated points, its really usually a very important point, said sister nathalie becquart, who helped spearhead one of francis progressive agenda items to make the church more responsive to the needs of laypeople. wary of francis from the start conservative and traditionalist catholics were wary of francis after their beloved benedict became the first pope in 600 years to resign. they grimaced when francis emerged on the loggia of st. peters basilica after his 2013 election without the ermine-rimmed, red velvet cape of his predecessors. they gasped a few weeks later when he washed the feet of women and muslims on holy thursday, a ritual previously restricted to men. we dont like this pope, headlined italys conservative daily il foglio a few months into his papacy. the dictator pope was the title of book by a british traditionalist published a few years later. over time, the critics worst fears came true. one breaking point came in 2016, when francis opened the door to letting divorced and civilly remarried catholics receive communion. some accused francis of heresy. four conservative cardinals formally asked him to clarify himself, issuing dubia or questions to him. they argued church doctrine held that catholics who remarried without a church annulment were living in sin and couldnt receive the sacraments. he never replied. reversing benedict on the latin mass conservatives could not have known that francis would take one of the most controversial steps of his pontificate by reimposing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass that benedict had relaxed. the reversal of benedicts signature liturgical legacy was evidence that francis had essentially declared war on traditionalists, the ancient liturgy and benedicts papacy itself. francis hates us. francis hates tradition. francis hates all that is good and beautiful, the traditionalist blog rorate caeli tweeted. but it concluded francis will die, the latin mass will live forever. francis insisted his aim was to preserve church unity. critics accused him of the opposite, of driving a wedge, and the outrage wasnt limited to u.s.-based conservative catholic media or fringe right-wing bloggers who had popularized francis-bashing. cardinal raymond burke, one of the dubia prelates whom francis sacked early on as the vaticans supreme court justice, blasted the severity of the papal crackdown. guinean cardinal robert sarah, the vaticans retired liturgy chief, responded with tweets quoting benedicts original 2007 law to relax the restrictions that francis had overturned. they were accompanied by a photo of benedict wearing the red cape that francis had eschewed the night of his election. a year earlier, sarah orchestrated a media firestorm by persuading benedict to co-author a book reaffirming priestly celibacy at a time when francis was considering ordaining married men to address a clergy shortage in the amazon. the book, and the prospect of a retired pope trying to influence a reigning one, created the nightmare scenario that canon lawyers and theologians had warned of in 2013, when benedict decided to retain the white cassock of the papacy in retirement and call himself emeritus pope, rather than revert to his birth name. the scandal died down after benedict removed himself as a co-author and francis fired his secretary, archbishop georg gaenswein, believed to have been behind it. after benedict died and gaenswein penned his highly critical, tell-all memoir nothing but the truth, francis exiled him from the vatican. then, after a time in his native germany, made him an ambassador. after burke joined a bigger group of cardinals questioning francis 2023 synod on the churchs future, francis cut him off financially. francis was more tolerant with another critic, the retired archbishop of hong kong, cardinal joseph zen. he excoriated the pope for agreeing in 2018 to a deal with china over the nomination of bishops, accusing francis of selling out chinas underground catholics who stayed loyal to the holy see during decades of persecution. francis received zen at the vatican and later called him a tender soul. francis won few friends with his frequent denunciations of clericalism the idea that priests should be put on a pedestal. he made it a tradition to use his christmas greeting to publicly shame vatican bureaucrats, accusing them of being careerist, money-grubbing gossips with spiritual alzheimers. german cardinal gerhard mueller complained that francis treated vatican monsignors like uneducated children. a major u.s. critic emerges francis biggest conservative critic was the vaticans former ambassador to the u.s., archbishop carlo maria vigano. in 2018, he said francis had covered up accusations that then-cardinal theodore mccarrick, an american, had slept with his seminarians. vigano demanded francis resign for allegedly rehabilitating mccarrick from sanctions imposed by benedict. the furor faded after francis defrocked mccarrick and vigano was discredited with conspiracy theories about covid-19. mccarrick died earlier this month. in 2024, francis excommunicated vigano after finding him guilty of schism. papal biographer austen ivereigh said francis dismantled much of the resistance. he lists the amazonian synod as a defining positive moment of his pontificate - not because of the incident with the statues but because the meeting emphasized his key pastoral priority of accompanying the faithful. the native peoples of amazonia were right here in st. peters square, and francis walked across to the synod with them, ivereigh said, recalling the feathered headdresses and indigenous statues that were on display. the pastor among his people, walking together. and i thought, that is him. that sums him up, he said.

  Title: Trump finally goes all in on tariffs. Free traders on the right and left are furious
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-03 23:05:03)

climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the

unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. free trade advocates in the republican partys old guard piled on donald trump as the stock market tumbled sharply downwards on thursday in response to the white houses tariff plan. wednesdays announcement of across-the-board tariffs on nearly all countries that export goods to the us sent markets spiraling in after-hours trading, which solidified into a steep drop thursday morning. reuters reported that the first us job losses from import tariff hikes were taking place in michigan and indiana, where automaker stellantis announced hundreds of temporary layoffs due to idling production facilities in mexico and canada. signs of the backlash from within conservative circles were already evident wednesday afternoon, as a handful of gop senators including former majority leader mitch mcconnell sided with democrats to condemn the presidents trade action. make no mistake goods made in america will be more expensive to manufacture and, ultimately, for consumers to purchase, with higher broad-based tariffs, mcconnell said after his vote. center-right media hammered trump on thursday while us allies showed no signs of backing down and instead openly plotted their own tariff measures in response. a trade war appears imminent on the road ahead. assuming the policy sticksand we hope it doesntthe effort amounts to an attempt to remake the u.s. economy and the world trading system, the murdoch-owned wall street journal editorial board wrote thursday morning. if the response is widespread retaliation, the result could be shrinking world trade and slower growth, recession, or worse, the journal continued. there will certainly be higher costs for american consumers and businesses. on the bulwark, host jonathan last sarcastically quipped thursday the woke socialist markets do not seem to appreciate the brilliance of trumps beautiful, very strong tariffs. the white house fired out its own news release highlighting praise from a handful of industry trade groups, as well as republican members of congress. but over wednesday evening and thursday morning the media and economic experts spent the hours picking apart apparent inconsistencies and other confusing aspects of the liberation day announcement. a top target of ridicule for the white houses usual critics were the 10 percent duties levied on the heard and mcdonald islands, a remote pair of islands controlled by australia with no human population and extremely limited fishing activity, according to forbes. virtually zero exports from the penguin-infested rocks reach the us. impressed the crack white house economic team not only found the heard and mcdonald islandsan uninhabited australian territory which is a two week sail from the mainland requiring a permit to visitbut that they managed to figure out the optimal retaliatory tariff to impose on penguins, wrote justin wolfers, a senior fellow at the brookings institution. on consumer news channel cnbc, one reporter could not hide his disdain for the formula used to calculate the reciprocal tariffs put into place by the white house, which according to a number of economists did not appear to actually factor in tariffs put into place by us trade partners. i started calling international trade economic experts, steve liesman said on the network thursday morning. nobody ever heard of this formula. nobody has ever used this formula. so im sorry, but the conclusion seems to be that the president kind of made this up as he went along. he made it up. ian bremmer of the eurasia group, added this is incredibly stupid. yales nonpartisan budget lab was out with increasingly dire predictions for the us economy after the presidents announcement this week. clothing and apparel prices are set to spike by nearly 20 percent nationwide, according to an analysis published wednesday, while the overall economy will shrink and american households in the middle income bracket will be hit with an annual income loss of around 1,700. i expect the fallout to continue into next week, as everyone is trying to assess what the effect will be on final consumer prices, michael tamvakis, a professor and economist with city st. georges university of london, told the independent on thursday. i imagine any good not available in the domestic us market will be affected, especially any food commodities which have to be imported promptly and have a short shelf life, tamvakis predicted. electronics, pharmaceuticals and auto sales would be among the sectors affected immediately, he explained, with higher drug prices in particular having the potential to hurt poorer americans the most. with the trump administration under a self-acknowledged mandate to bring down consumer prices and inflation, the president could be setting republicans up in a very uncomfortable spot come midterm season. the state of the us economy is likely to be very close to the top of voters minds as congressional reelection campaigns begin in earnest next year and later in 2024, for some. high grocery prices and other issues caused by a trade war could easily lead voters to hand the house back to democratic control for the remainder of trumps term, even if the senate remains out of reach. the real danger trump faces could be from dividing the coalition which has now elected him twice traditional republican voters who want to see the us economy grow and thrive, and maga true believers who are willing to see a contraction if it means reorganizing the economy under an america first vision. democrats, of course, are counting on this as their party continues to grapple with a crisis of confidence. voters remain unhappy with congressional democrats, especially senate minority leader chuck schumer, amid the doge-ification of the federal government and the collapse of democratic resistance in the senate, both in the face of the laken riley act and more recent government shutdown fight. schumer, who saw his party shed three seats in the senate last year, maintains that he still has a winning record in terms of both elections and legislating. a tanking us economy could make that pronouncement a reality come next year. if trump doesnt see things turn around for the us economy before the end of the year, he could well end up handing schumer a lifeline right when his rival needs it most. join thought-provoking

  Content: atlanta ap trump administration officials were out in force across the television networks sunday defending president donald trumps economic policies after another week of reeling markets that saw the republican administration reverse course on some of its steepest tariffs. trump, meanwhile, said on his social media platform that there ultimately will be no exemptions for his sweeping tariff agenda, disputing characterizations that he has granted tariff exceptions for certain electronics, including smart phones, whose production is concentrated in china. rather, trump said, those products are subject to the existing 20 fentanyl tariffs, and they are just moving to a different tariff bucket. white house advisers and cabinet members tried to project confidence and calm amid trumps on-again, off-again approach to tariffs on imported goods from around the world. but their explanations about the overall agenda, coupled with trumps latest statements, also reflected shifting narratives from a president who, as a candidate in 2024, promised an immediate economic boost and lower prices but now asks american businesses and consumers for patience. a week ago, trumps team stood by his promise to leave the impending tariffs in place without exceptions. they used their latest news show appearances to defend his move to ratchet back to a 10 universal tariff for most nations except china 145, while seeming to grant exemptions for certain electronics like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and semiconductor chips. here are the highlights of what trump lieutenants said last week vs. sunday there are varying answers on the purpose of the tariffs long before launching his first presidential campaign in 2015, trump bemoaned the offshoring of u.s. manufacturing. his promise is to reindustrialize the united states and eliminate trade deficits with other countries. last week commerce secretary howard lutnick, interviewed on cbs face the nation, played up national security. youve got to realize this is a national security issue, he said, raising the worst-case scenarios of what could happen if the u.s. were involved in a war. we dont make medicine in this country anymore. we dont make ships. we dont have enough steel and aluminum to fight a battle, right? he said. sunday lutnick stuck to that national security framing, but white house trade adviser peter navarro focused more on the import taxes being leverage in the bigger economic puzzle. the world cheats us. theyve been cheating us for decades, navarro said on nbcs meet the press. he cited practices such as dumping products at unfairly low prices, currency manipulation and barriers to u.s. auto and agricultural products entering foreign markets. navarro insisted the tariffs would yield broader bilateral trade deals to address all those issues. but he also relied on a separate justification when discussing china the illicit drug trade. china has killed over a million people with their fentanyl, he said. speaking before trumps truth social post disputing the notion of exemptions, lutnick alluded to that coming policy. theyre going to have a special focus-type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored, he told abcs this week. the status of negotiations with other nations, including china, remains fuzzy last week with the higher rates set to be collected beginning april 9, administration officials argued that other countries would rush to the negotiating table. ive heard that there are negotiations ongoing and that there are a number of offers, kevin hassett, director of the white house economic council, told abc. he claimed that more than 50 countries were reaching out, though he did not name any. sunday navarro named the united kingdom, the european union, india, japan, south korea, indonesia and israel as among the nations in active negotiations with u.s. trade representative jamieson greer, lutnick and other officials. greer said on cbs that his goal was to get meaningful deals before 90 days - the duration of trumps pause - and i think were going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks. talks with china have not begun, he said. we expect to have a conversation with them, he said, emphasizing it would be between trump and chinese president xi jinping. trump took an aggressive tone himself sunday in his social media post, saying we will not be held hostage by other countries, especially hostile trading nations like china, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the american people. navarro was not as specific about beijing. we have opened up our invitation to them, he said. lutnick characterized the outreach as soft entrees through intermediaries. pressed on whether there is any meaningful back and forth, navarro said, the president has a very good relationship with president xi. then he proceeded to criticize several chinas polices and trade practices. the pitches are different, but confidence is constant last week navarro was bullish even after u.s. and global trading markets suffered trillions of dollars in losses. the first rule, particularly for the smaller investors out there, you cant lose money unless you sell. and, right now, the smart strategy is not to panic, he said on fox news channels sunday morning futures. sunday navarros optimism did not waver despite another net-loss week for securities markets and rocky bond markets. so, this is unfolding exactly like we thought it would in a dominant scenario, he said. others confronted some of the more complex realities of trying to achieve trumps goal of restoring a bygone era of u.s. manufacturing. lutnick suggested the focus is on returning high-tech jobs, while sidestepping questions about lower-skilled manufacturing of goods such as shoes that could mean higher prices because of higher wages for u.s. workers. but some of that high-tech production is what trump has, for now, exempted from the tariffs that he and his advisers frame as leverage for forcing companies to open u.s. facilities. hassett did acknowledge widespread angst. the survey data has been showing that people are anxious about the changes a little bit, he said, before steering his answer to employment rates. the hard data, he said, has been really, really strong.

  Content: analysis trumps tariffs are making it harder for republicans to cut taxes and spending, eric garcia writes from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. if president donald trump hoped to get a better day on wall street two days after his massive tariff announcement, he was sorely mistaken. the dow jones industrial average closed on friday losing 2,231.07 points, or 5.50, another brutal dive. federal reserve chairman jerome powell spoke to journalists at a business reporters conference friday and while he did not comment on politics, he did offer a withering assessment of the effects of the tariffs. while uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth, powell said. trump nominated powell to lead the central bank in 2018, and powell earned such plaudits for the way he handled the economic fallout from the covid-19 pandemic that joe biden renominated him. but just before powell made his remarks, trump sent a message to the chairman via truth social. he is always late, but he could now change his image, and quickly, trump said on his social media platform. energy prices are down, interest rates are down, inflation is down, even eggs are down 69, and jobs are up, all within two months a big win for america. cut interest rates, jerome, and stop playing politics! trumps decision to wage a trade war came at a point that forced maximum pain for republicans and when his domestic agenda hangs in the balance. republicans historically have not liked tariffs and have supported free trade as part of their larger ideology that barriers to business stifle competition and kill jobs. trumps style of nationalism refuted that position, and his first speech as president denounced free trade deals. now republicans find themselves in a difficult place when they might need to defy trump for political and policy reasons. on wednesday, iowa senator chuck grassley, the senior-most republican, told the independent before trumps announcement that he worried the tariffs would drive up the cost of potash, which farmers use to grow soybeans and corn. that evening, four republicans lisa murkowski of alaska, susan collins of maine and kentuckys rand paul and mitch mcconnell- joined the democrats to pass legislation that would roll back trumps tariffs on canada. by thursday, grassley announced that he and democratic senator maria cantwell of washington would co-sponsor legislation that would require a president to explain the rationale and effects of new tariffs. the bill would also mandate that any new tariffs would expire without the approval of congress. grassley is not the only one sweating the effects of tariffs. senator ted cruz of texas, an archconservative who hails from a state that shares a border with mexico, warned on his podcast that the tariffs will raise the cost of automobiles immensely. its not just foreign cars that will go up all the american cars, their prices are going to go up, too, he said, adding that a manufacturer from one of the major automobile companies in the united states told him that by june, the price of american-made cars would jump by 4,500. all the while, republicans in the senate are hoping to begin the heavy lifting of passing trumps agenda. later on friday evening, the senate will begin a vote-a-rama for amendments to pass a budget resolution that would allow them to begin negotiating the details of the one, big, beautiful bill to drive through trumps domestic policy agenda. that would only be the beginning of the senates problems though. the committee for a responsible federal budget flagged that the proposed legislation would add almost 6 trillion to the debt with only a pittance of spending cuts. this will likely infuriate house republicans, whose budget resolution calls for 4.5 trillion in tax cuts only if the house finds 2 trillion worth of spending cuts. democrats have said that the 880 billion worth of spending cuts that the house energy and commerce committee needs to find would come out of medicaid. all of this comes as trumps proposed tariffs will eat away at americans wallets, and while their retirement savings get crushed in the stock market. as trumps approval rating continues to take a hit, republicans will feel a continued sense of urgency to pass his agenda, but that would make it even more politically unpopular. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

reacted with shock and concern on wednesday to the sweeping series of tariffs donald trump announced on all u.s. trading partners. despite the trump administration framing the measures as a way to bolster u.s. manufacturing, those within american industry warned the tariffs might do the opposite. manufacturers are scrambling to determine the exact implications for their operations, national association of manufacturers president and ceo jay timmons said in a statement on wednesday. the stakes for manufacturers could not be higher. the tariffs, which trump continues to erroneously claim will mean other countries paying the u.s., will in fact threaten investment, jobs, supply chains, and, in turn, americas ability to outcompete other nations and lead as the preeminent manufacturing superpower, according to timmons. other industry leaders had a similar outlook. the national restaurant association warned the tariffs will create change and disruption, as small business owners struggled with increased prices. many restaurant operators source as many domestic ingredients as they can, but its simply not possible for u.s. farmers and ranchers to produce the volumes needed to support consumer demand, the groups ceo michelle korsmo said in a statement. what we have heard from business of all sizes, across all industries, from around the country is that these broad tariffs are a tax increase that will raise prices for american consumers and hurt the economy, the u.s. chamber of commerce added in a statement of its own. this is catastrophic for american families, matt priest, president and chief executive of the footwear distributors and retailers of america, told the new york times. we had hoped the president would take a more targeted approach, but these broad tariffs will only drive-up costs, reduce product quality and weaken consumer confidence. political reaction to the tariff plan which includes 25 percent tariffs on imported autos, 10 percent baseline tariffs on all imports, and double-digit reciprocal tariffs on numerous individual nations was split on predictable partisan lines, though a handful of senate republicans joined all democrats in the upper house for a largely symbolic vote wednesday evening to reject the national emergency determination the trump administration has used to justify tariffs on canada. democratic critics of trump hammered the president, arguing the tariffs would do the opposite of the republicans campaign promises to lower prices and aid american families. rep. nydia velazquez of new york warned in a post on x directed at trump of the working families, small businesses, and everyday americans getting crushed by your half-baked trade war. others emphasized that the tariffs, which, despite trumps claims to the contrary, are paid by u.s. companies importing goods, functionally act as tax hikes on u.s. consumers. donald trump just imposed the largest tax hike in our lifetime, california governor gavin newsom said on wednesday on x. liberal political commentator jonathan chait argued in the atlantic that trump, whose tariff plans sent stocks declining after hours and raised fears of a recession, might become the first one to kill off a healthy economy through an almost universally foreseeable unforced error. some cheered the economic overhaul. hes resetting the negotiating table. hes resetting the deck here, rep. andy ogles, republican of tennessee, said in a video statement on wednesday, adding, at the end of the day, i know trump is going to be proactive. hes going to put america first and put american workers first, which is what we should do. todays tariff action will cement president trumps legacy as one that ushered in a new golden age of american industrialization and prosperity, nick iacovella of the coalition for a prosperous america said on x. absolutely massive day for those of us that care about strengthening our nations industrial capacity and creating working-class jobs. on the international front, leaders also showed concern. it is the american people who will pay the biggest price for these unjustified tariffs, australian prime minister anthony albanese said after trumps announcement. we will do everything we can to work towards an agreement with the united states, with the goal of avoiding a trade war that would inevitably weaken the west in favor of other global players, added italtys giorgia meloni. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

wall street, the nasdaq broke a record with its largest single-day point drop in the markets 50-year history as investors responded to president donald trumps tariff plan. both the nasdaq and dow jones suffered their worst days since march 2020 amid the covid-19 pandemic. the dow fell 1,679 points, which ranks in the top five for most points lost in a single day. the nasdaq fell 1,050 points for its largest one-day drop. the drop happened as investors got spooked over the potential impact from president donald trumps tariff plan and fears it could spark a global trade war. trump has said the policy is necessary to level the playing field for american manufacturers. however, many economists have warned his plan could have a negative impact on the economy as tariffs are expected to raise prices. despite thursdays historically bad day, some analysts believed it could have been worse. markets may actually be underreacting, especially if these rates turn out to be final, given the potential knock-on effects to global consumption and trade, sean sun, portfolio manager at thornburg investment management, told the associated press. but trump remained confident. the markets are going to boom, the president predicted outside the white house thursday. the country is going to boom. against the backdrop of sliding markets thursday, white house officials defended the new tariffs. today, the world starts taking us seriously. our workforce will finally be treated fairly, commerce secretary howard lutnick said in a statement. hours earlier he told cnn the world should stop exploiting the united states. treasury secretary scott bessent issued a statement the presidents historic actions will level the playing field for american workers and usher in a new age of economic strength. but former treasury secretary under bill clinton, larry h. summers, said he would have left his post if such a plan was unveiled. if any administration of which i was a part had launched an economic policy so totally ungrounded in serious analysis or so dangerous and damaging, i would have resigned in protest, he wrote thursday on x. while announcing his sweeping plan, trump vowed to usher in a golden age for america. but thursdays stock market lacked any of that luster. major companies including restaurant chains, retailers, and tech giants that rely on products from around the globe saw their stocks decline as they brace for supply chain disruptions. starbucks ended the day down 11 percent while chipotle fell nearly 4 percent. shares gap tanked 20 percent and macys dropped almost 14 percent. apple plunged more than 9 percent while amazon dipped nearly the same amount. some automakers also endured a rough day as trumps 25 percent tariff on imported cars took effect. tesla stock dropped almost 6 percent and stellantis, parent company of jeep, chrysler, and dodge, slid nearly 10 percent. stellantis announced thursday it was halting production at its factories in mexico and canada. about 900 u.s. employees are expected to be laid off, the automaker said thursday. meanwhile, investors seemed to have found some solace in comfort foods. french fry producer lamb weston gained 10 percent while general mills, coca-cola and kraft heinz each gained nearly 3 percent. thursdays market plunge didnt seem to ease fears that trumps liberation day could dwindle retirement funds tied to the stock markets. georgia taylor, founder of tailored wealth, told the financial times those near retirement must monitor their pensions closely. withdrawing during market downturns can deplete funds faster, so seeking advice on a flexible withdrawal strategy is crucial. this highlights the growing need for financial planning to make pensions last longer. the effect on the retirement savings will depend on the years a person has left until retirement, maggie switek, senior director on the research team at the milken institute, told the independent. for young adults, with a longer time horizon left until retirement, the effects may be offset by future changes in the market, with the stock markets trending upward over longer periods of time. hedge fund manager bradley wickens predicted thursday was just the beginning of a long road ahead for the fallout of trumps tariff plan. he told the wall street journal the true nature of how negative this is is going to take time to manifest itself during april and may, as it all dawns on everyone that, wow, these tariffs are here for a long time. the final impact of trumps plan is still to be determined as companies and other countries determine their response. european commission president ursula von der leyen called trumps decision a major blow to the global economy, adding we are now preparing for further countermeasures, to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail. canadian prime minister mark carney announced that his country plans to match the u.s.s 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles we take these measures reluctantly. and we take them in ways that is intended and will cause maximum impact in the united states and minimum impact in canada. in the face of tariff panic and market turbulence, asked how he thought things were going, trump replied i think its going very well. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their

  Title: Donald Trump’s Tariff Blitz Is Political Suicide - New York Magazine

  Content: save this article to read it later. find this story in your accounts saved for later section. give donald trump some credit he is following through, absolutely, on a campaign promise. while few americans imagined that electing trump again would make elon musk a de facto president, tasked with eviscerating the federal bureaucracy, it was no secret that tariffs would be on the menu if trump returned to the white house. tariffs and trade deficits have been a trump obsession for decades. he could be heard talking them up in the 1980s and 1990s, and he has long romanticized a protectionist economy. and while trumps liberation day tariffs are unnecessarily punitive and ultimately counterproductive in an inflationary environment, not all of them can be dismissed out of hand. it is true that globalization and free-trade agreements crippled onetime industrial powerhouses in the northeast and midwest. the white and black working classes were punished in cities like gary and youngstown and detroit as manufacturers fled the country and cheap, foreign-produced clothing, toys, and automobiles flooded the market. joe bidens industrial policy targeted china for tariffs on electric vehicles and solar panels, and there are plenty of reasons for trump to continue or even stiffen tariffs on our greatest geopolitical rival. it is true, as his treasury secretary, scott bessent, recently said, that the american dream is not merely access to cheap goods. the american worker shouldnt suffer so another export champion overseas can flourish. of course, trump is trump, and there is no subtlety to his latest tariffs and no sense of proportion. trump announced a 10 percent universal tariff on all goods barring certain exemptions imported into the u.s., beginning april 5. goods from china were hit with an enormous tariff rate of 54 percent. japan was taxed at 24 percent, europe at 20 percent, and there are many more reciprocal tariffs, which will take effect on april 9. this morning, a 25 percent tariff on all automobile imports kicked in. canada and mexico, already targeted for tariffs, were not a focus of the so-called liberation day. various analysts rate these tariffs as among the very highest in american history, surpassing the smoot-hawley tariff act of 1930 and rivaling the protectionist regimes of the 1890s. an open question remains how long they will last or if most of them represent yet another trump negotiating tactic. bessent seemed to suggest that the tariffs could be provisional. one of the messages that id like to get out tonight is everybody sit back take a deep breath dont immediately retaliate. lets see where this goes, he said, according to cnn. because if you retaliate, thats how we get escalation. if the tariffs hold, trade wars are coming and life is going to get more expensive, whether american manufacturing glory is restored or not. inflation could increase, and the economy may, in the short term, tip toward a recession. for the market-conscious trump, it will be grim times on wall street, which wrongly gambled that trump wasnt serious about levying heavy tariffs on americas trading partners. investors are bound to get more skittish. the postelection stock-market gains have already been wiped out. this is the real problem for trump. his calling card has always been the economy. as democrats, throughout his first term, fulminated about the state of the republic, trump could point to low inflation, low interest rates, and a strong stock market. during bidens presidency, americans felt nostalgia for the pre-pandemic 2010s, and that was trumps time in the sun. as much as they may have found his conduct disconcerting, voters believed he could be an adequate steward of the economy. individual presidents cant wholly dictate economic conditions, but its inarguable that trump, less radicalized than he is today, did relatively little to destabilize the 2010ss financial environment. tariffs were reasonable, the federal bureaucracy was preserved, and the gop-run congress failed in its politically toxic bid to destroy the affordable care act. surveys already show trump posting poorer numbers on the economy. his strong suit is gone, and its probably not coming back not with tariffs, doge, or attempts to gut medicaid. there is virtually nothing trump is doing in his second term to improve the everyday reality of working-class people. mass layoffs of federal employees merely punish those who had stable jobs and make interacting with crucial bureaucracies like the department of veterans affairs all the more challenging. a stiff tariff wont lower a grocery bill. and if republicans do follow through on their bid to lower the deficit by slashing medicaid, which offers health care to some 70 million americans plenty of them republicans in rural areas the backlash will be severe. the bloom is already off the maga rose. the wisconsin supreme court race was a devastating outcome for the trump-musk wing of the party at this point perhaps its only real wing and an indication of where we are probably headed. democrats and independents are furious and ready to vote against trump-aligned candidates. had elise stefanik not been returned to her district in the north country, theres an outside chance that a special election there could have turned a deep-red seat blue. if trump is serious about bringing back 1930s- or 1890s-style protectionism to america, he should consult a history textbook and find out what happened to the republican governments that instituted the tariffs. neither of them survived, with herbert hoover, in the teeth of the great depression, giving way to franklin d. roosevelt and a democratic majority that wouldnt be broken for a generation. democrats have a long, long way to go to reach their fdr-era heights. but trump, through his chaos, is helping them along plenty. by submitting your email, you agree to our terms and

  Title: Trump Is Defiant as Tariff Moves Roil Markets a Second Day
  Source: www.nytimes.com (2025-04-04 23:50:21)
  Content: two days after president trump announced his expansive global tariffs, the united states confronted wide-ranging and painful blowback, as china retaliated against american goods and markets plummeted again on worries of a persistent, damaging trade war. no portion of the global economy appeared unscathed as the world braced for mr. trump to begin imposing his nearly across-the-board taxes on imports saturday, marking the first salvo in a potentially costly trade conflict that the president has vigorously defended. china, which mr. trump has already hit with 20 percent tariffs, announced plans to retaliate. beijing promised to impose a 34 percent tariff on american goods next week, including on agricultural products. china calibrated its tariffs to match mr. trumps decision to add a 34 percent tax to chinese imports. the tit-for-tat delivered a huge blow to financial markets, as wall street reckoned with the rising odds of an escalating global trade standoff. by the closing bell, the sp 500 had fallen by almost 6 percent, pulling it closer into a bear market, a widely used wall street term for a decline of at least 20 percent from its peak. the tech-heavy nasdaq fell 5.8 percent, pushing it into bear market territory. as china took aim at the united states, ngozi okonjo-iweala, the director general of the world trade organization, warned on friday against a cycle of retaliatory measures that lead to further declines in trade. in the united states, jerome h. powell, the chair of the federal reserve, struck his own downbeat note over the unpredictable trajectory of the economy. while uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected, mr. powell said. the same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth. but mr. trump responded to the day of chaos by striking a defiant tone. having decamped from washington to mar-a-lago, his home in florida, he declared on truth social my policies will never change. instead, the president insisted in another post that his strategy was already working, as he held up a newly released and better-than-expected jobs report, which reflected u.s. hiring increased in the month before the announcement of his tariffs. at one point, the president even circulated another users video that argued trump is purposely crashing the market, in a bid to force the fed to lower interest rates. he later called on mr. powell to do just that, demanding that the independent chair of the central bank stop playing politics. and mr. trump eventually turned his attention to china, attacking the country for having played it wrong by retaliating against the united states. the president and his aides previously have signaled they could ratchet up their tariff rates if other nations look to exact retribution on u.s. goods. the global scramble in many ways underscored the weight of mr. trumps tariffs and the significance of his grand aspirations to recalibrate the global trading system. the white house sees these levies as critical toward resetting u.s. trade relationships, which the president contends are unfair, while boosting u.s. manufacturing and raising new revenue. but the tariffs, which are taxes on imports, threaten to fall hard on businesses that could face new costs to produce their goods. that, in turn, could hammer consumers, who are likely to shoulder the burden of any price increases. economists widely believe the result could be a rising rate of inflation, and a slowdown in consumer spending and business investment, which together crimp u.s. growth and push the economy into a recession. markets are expressing a vote of no confidence in the new tariff regime, said joe brusuelas, the principal and chief economist at the consulting firm rsm. he added that mr. trumps commentary on friday only adds to the consternation and concern that theres no strategic road map. but mr. trump and his top aides have swatted away those dour projections in recent days. fanning across cable news, they have dismissed the ebb and flow of the markets and acknowledged the possibility that tariffs could create short-term economic pain, which the president has likened to a sick patients painful yet necessary medical operation. the administration and its conservative allies have also labored to deflect criticism from economists, repeatedly portraying them as naysayers who had wrongly judged the presidents agenda in the past. i think its very clear the rhetoric of the economic community, in particular, is almost entirely ideological and out of proportion to the actual sort of risk-reward calculation, oren cass, the chief economist at american compass, a conservative economic think tank, said friday. global leaders, american politicians and others rejected that view, saying mr. trumps approach threatened to weaken the global economy and send prices soaring just as much of the world was finally returning to a sense of balance after two years of rapid inflation. ms. okonjo-iweala, the director general of the w.t.o., warned in a statement friday that mr. trumps policies could lead to an overall contraction of around 1 percent in global merchandise trade volumes this year, representing a downward revision of nearly four percentage points from previous projections. the state of california signaled it would try to negotiate its own trade deals, as gov. gavin newsom, a democrat, looked to protect local agriculture and other businesses. in a statement, mr. newsom said the presidents tactics would be felt in pretty profound ways to real people, including those who voted for donald trump and are now being betrayed by this very administration. even video games could not escape the fray japans nintendo announced that it would delay presales of its widely anticipated upcoming console, the switch 2, as it cited a need to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. mr. trump has said japan will face a 24 percent tariff on its exports to the united states. some foreign governments also mounted a last-minute scramble to figure out how, or if, to retaliate, while trying to persuade washington to relax its coming taxes on imports. maros sefcovic, the trade commissioner for the european union, said friday that he had a frank exchange with mr. trumps trade emissaries, posting on the social-media site x, i was clear us tariffs are damaging, unjustified. earlier friday, mr. trump said he had spoken by phone with to lam, the general secretary of the communist party of vietnam, which stands to see a 46 percent tariff on its exports to the united states beginning next week. by mr. trumps telling, vietnam wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s., though the president did not explicitly say if he would accept such a deal. the trump administration has sent mixed signals over its willingness to cut a deal some of mr. trumps advisers have said they do not intend to haggle, but the president himself told reporters earlier in the week that he could be open to negotiation if the united states received something phenomenal in return for relaxing tariffs. reporting was contributed by ana swanson, laurel rosenhall, colby smith, zachary small and keith bradsher.

  Title: Tariff turmoil: How Tesla and other companies are dealing with the uncertainty of the trade war

  Content: by damian j. troise, ap business writer new york ap uncertainty over tariffs and an unpredictable trade war is weighing heavily on companies as they report their latest financial results and try to give investors financial forecasts. some tariffs remain in place against key u.s. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. the tariff and trade picture has been shifting for months, sometimes changing drastically on a daily basis. those shifts make it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales. on tuesday, treasury secretary scott bessent said he expects a de-escalation in the trade war between the u.s. and china, but cautioned that talks between the two sides had yet to formally start. heres how several big companies are dealing with the tariff confusion tesla is in a better position than most car companies to deal with tariffs because it makes most of its u.s. cars domestically. but it still sources materials from other nations and will face import taxes. the bigger impact will be seen in the companys energy business. the company said the impact will be outsized because it sources lfp battery cells from china. the broader trade war could also hurt the company as china, the worlds largest electric vehicle market, retaliates against the u.s. tesla was forced earlier this month to stop taking orders from mainland customers for two models, its model s and model x. it makes the model y and model 3 for the chinese market at its factory in shanghai. ceo elon musk, an adviser to president donald trump, on tuesday reiterated that he believes lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity. but he added that ultimately the president decides on what tariffs to impose. the amsterdam-based maker of paints and coatings for industrial and commercial use said the big risk from tariffs could come in the form of lower demand for its products. the company said almost all sales of finished goods in the u.s. were locally produced, with the majority of raw materials locally sourced. over the years, we deliberately localized both our procurement and production in the u.s., said ceo gregoire poux-guillaume, in a conference call with analysts. we also largely run china for china and use the rest of asia instead as an export base. the companys products range from paints and coatings for the automotive industry to the do-it-yourself homeowner. broader tariffs could squeeze consumers and businesses and hurt sales. the medical device maker said it expects most of the effecs of tariffs to hit the company during the second half of the year, but that it can absorb the impact. the company raised its earnings and revenue forecasts for the year, despite the tariffs. it estimates a 200 million impact from tariffs in 2025, but said it can offset that through higher sales and reductions in discretionary spending. the company said it has a long-standing supply chain around the globe and has made significant investments in the u.s. boeing said much of its supply chain is in the u.s. and many of its imports from canada and mexico are exempt from tariffs under an existing trade agreement. the company does have suppliers in japan and italy, but it expects to recover those tariff costs. the net annual cost of higher tariffs on the supply chain is less than 500 million. a bigger concern is the potential for retaliatory tariffs, which could impact its ability to deliver aircraft. china, a key target for u.s. tariffs, has retaliated in part by no longer accepting deliveries of boeing aircraft. att, like its peers in the telecommunications sector, faces higher costs for cellphones and other equipment. the company said it believes it can manage anticipated higher costs, based on the current pause in some tariffs and its supply chain. the magnitude of any increase will depend on a variety of factors, including how much of the tariffs the vendors pass on, the impact that the tariffs have on consumer and business demand, said ceo john stankey, on a conference call with analysts.

  Title: Trump announces huge new tariffs to promote US manufacturing, risking inflation and trade wars
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 20:57:51)
  Content: by josh boak associated press washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the new tariffs, coming on what trump has named liberation day, are a bid to boost u.s. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he says are years of unfair trade practices. but by most economists assessments, the move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and upend decades-old alliances. the white house is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble. april 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern american history, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said tuesday. she said the new tariffs would take effect immediately. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. based on the possibility of broad 20 tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. because trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. leavitt is among three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the associated press on first and fifth amendment grounds. the ap says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. the white house says the ap is not following an executive order to refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america. associated press writers mike householder in oldcastle, ontario, sylvie corbet in paris and lisa mascaro contributed to this report.

  Title: 5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday - CNBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-21 12:04:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism in international relations theory posits states as primary actors pursuing self-interest in an anarchic global system. The article text, particularly phrases like 'trumps trade war with china...continues to escalate', 'beijing promised to retaliate', and 'china will resolutely take reciprocal countermeasures', exemplifies this. These snippets reveal a dynamic of escalating tensions and retaliatory threats between major geopolitical actors driven by perceived national interests and power struggles, aligning with realist interpretations of state behavior.; Theories_and_interpretations: Keynesian economics emphasizes the role of aggregate demand and consumer sentiment in economic cycles. The article states 'americans have grown more sour on trumps handling of the economy...as tariffs and efforts to slash federal government spending hit sentiment' and 'more americans now believe the economy will get worse'. This textual evidence suggests a decline in consumer confidence and economic outlook directly linked to government policies (tariffs, spending cuts), supporting a Keynesian interpretation where government actions significantly influence economic sentiment and potentially trigger downturns.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions 'threats to the federal reserves independence after trump hinted at the termination of fed chair jerome powell' without detailing the nature of these 'threats' or the context of Trump's 'hint'. This omission is noteworthy because central bank independence is crucial for economic stability. What specific actions or statements constitute these 'threats', and what are the potential implications for market confidence if central bank autonomy is perceived to be compromised?; Intriguing_angles: The article twice states 'more americans now believe the economy will get worse than at any time since 2023'. This repetition, and the recent year 2023 as a negative benchmark, is unusual. Is this repetition an error, or is it intentional emphasis? Why is 2023 specifically highlighted? Does this reference point to a particular economic shift or policy change around that time that is being implicitly compared to the current situation, thus framing current pessimism as a significant recent decline?

and computer chips. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose have caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy, despite the risk of political backlash as voters in last years election said they wanted trump to combat inflation. senior administration officials, who insisted on anonymity to preview the new tariffs with reporters ahead of trumps speech, said the taxes would raise hundreds of billions of dollars annually in revenues. they said the 10 baseline rate existed to help ensure compliance, while the higher rates were based on the trade deficits run with other nations and then halved to reach the numbers that trump presented in the rose garden. in a follow-up series of questions by the associated press, the white house could not say whether the tariff exemptions on imports worth 800 or less would remain in place, possibly shielding some imports from the new taxes. based on the possibility of broad tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most outside analyses by banks and think tanks see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnating growth. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress . president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. how will trumps tariffs work? how soon until prices might rise?apr. 2, 2025, 854 p.m. trump has blunt words on possible car price hikes amid new tariffsmar. 31, 2025, 956 a.m. because trump had hyped his tariffs without providing specifics until wednesday, he provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. powered by

  Title: Trump Advisers Say 50-Plus Countries Have Reached Out for Tariff Talks With White House
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-06 18:32:26)
  Content: fort lauderdale, fla. ap top administration officials said sunday that more than 50 countries targeted by president donald trumps new tariffs have reached out to begin negotiations over the sweeping import taxes that have sent financial markets reeling, raised fears of a recession and upended the global trading system. the higher rates are set to be collected beginning wednesday, ushering in a new era of economic uncertainty with no clear end in sight. treasury secretary scott bessent said unfair trade practices are not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks. the united states, he said, must see what the countries offer and whether its believable. trump, who spent the weekend in florida playing golf, posted online that we will win. hang tough, it wont be easy. his cabinet members and economic advisers were out in force sunday defending the tariffs and downplaying the consequences for the global economy. there doesnt have to be a recession. who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week? bessent said. what we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity. trumps tariff blitz, announced april 2, fulfilled a key campaign promise as he acted without congress to redraw the rules of global trade. it was a move decades in the making for trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the u.s. he is gambling that voters will be willing to endure higher prices for everyday items to enact his economic vision. countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with china and others retaliating quickly. top white house economic adviser kevin hassett acknowledged that other countries are angry and retaliating, and, he said, by the way, coming to the table. he cited the office of the u.s. trade representative as reporting that more than 50 nations had reached out to the white house to begin talks. adding to the turmoil, the new tariffs are hitting american allies and adversaries alike, including israel, which is facing a 17 tariff. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is set to visit the white house monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion with trump along with the war in gaza and other issues. another american ally, vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs. trump said vietnams leader said in a telephone call that his country wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s. and a key european partner, italian premier giorgia meloni, said she disagreed with trumps move but was ready to deploy all the tools negotiating and economic necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized. commerce secretary howard lutnick made clear there was no postponing tariffs that are days away. the tariffs are coming. of course they, he said, adding that trump needed to reset global trade. but he committed only to having them definitely remain for days and weeks. in congress, where trumps republican party has long championed free trade, the tariff regiment has been met with applause but also significant unease. several republican senators have already signed onto a new bipartisan bill that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to congress. lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. wyomings john barrasso, the no. 2 member of the senates gop leadership, said trump is doing what he has every right to do. but, he acknowledged, there is concern, and theres concern across the country. people are watching the markets. therell be a discussion in the senate, barrasso said of the tariffs. well see which way the discussion goes. trumps government cost-cutting guru, billionaire businessman elon musk, had been relatively silent on trumps tariffs, but said at a weekend event in italy that he would like to see the u.s. and europe move to a zero-tariff situation. the comment from the tesla owner who leads trumps department of government efficiency drew a rebuke from white house trade adviser peter navarro. elon, when he is on his doge lane, is great. but we understand whats going on here. we just have to understand. elon sells cars, navarro said. he added hes simply protecting his own interest as any business person would do. lawrence summers, an economist who was treasury secretary under democratic president bill clinton, said trump and his economic team are sending contradictory messages if they say they are interested in reviving manufacturing while still being open to negotiating with trade partners. if other countries eliminate their tariffs, and the u.s, does, too, he said, its just making a deal, then we dont raise any revenue nor do we get any businesses to relocate to the united states. if its a permanent revenue source and trying to get businesses to relocate to the united states, then were going to have these tariffs permanently. so the president cant have it both ways. bessent was on nbcs meet the press, hassett and summers appeared on abcs this week, lutnick and barrasso were on cbs face the nation and navarro was interviewed on fox news channels sunday morning futures. ______ associated press writers giada zampano in rome and fatima hussein in jupiter, florida, contributed to this report. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: The World Reacts With Caution to US 'Reciprocal' Tariffs Against Dozens of Nations
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-02 22:55:26)
  Content: bangkok ap the sweeping new tariffs announced wednesday by u.s. president donald trump were met initially with measured reactions from key trading partners, highlighting the lack of appetite for a full-fledged trade war. trump presented the import taxes, which he calls reciprocal tariffs and range from 10 to 49, in the simplest terms the u.s. would do to its trading partners what he said they had been doing to the u.s. for decades. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, he said. but it is not going to happen anymore. the president promised that jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country. he framed it not just as an economic issue, but a question of national security that threatens our very way of life. financial markets were jolted, with u.s. stock futures down by as much as 3 early thursday and tokyos market leading losses in asia. oil prices sank more than 2 a barrel and the price of bitcoin dropped 4.4. nobody wants a trade war shortly after trumps announcement, the british government said the united states remains the u.k.s closest ally. business secretary jonathan reynolds said the u.k. hoped to strike a trade deal to mitigate the impact of the 10 tariffs on british goods announced by trump. nobody wants a trade war and our intention remains to secure a deal, said reynolds. but nothing is off the table and the government will do everything necessary to defend the u.k.s national interest. italys conservative premier giorgia meloni described the new 20 tariffs against the european union as wrong, saying they benefit neither side. we will do everything we can to work towards an agreement with the united states, with the aim of avoiding a trade war that would inevitably weaken the west in favor of other global players, meloni said in a facebook post. brazils government said it was considering taking the case to the world trade organization. and later, in a rare display of unity, brazils congress unanimously passed a reciprocity bill to allow its government to retaliate against any country or trade bloc that imposes tariffs on brazilian goods. no basis in logic some countries took issue with the white houses calculations. australian prime minister anthony albanese said the u.s. tariffs imposed on his country were totally unwarranted, but australia will not retaliate. president trump referred to reciprocal tariffs. a reciprocal tariff would be zero, not 10, said albanese. the u.s. and australia have a free trade agreement and the u.s. has a 2-to-1 trade surplus with australia. this is not the act of a friend. trump said the united states bought 3 billion of australian beef last year, but australia would not accept u.s. beef imports. albanese said the ban on raw u.s. beef was for biosecurity reasons. the 29 tariff imposed on the tiny south pacific outpost of norfolk island came as a shock. the australian territory has a population of around 2,000 people and the economy revolves around tourism. to my knowledge, we do not export anything to the united states, norfolk island administrator george plant, the australian governments representative on the island, told the ap thursday. we dont charge tariffs on anything. i cant think of any non-tariff barriers that would be in place either, so were scratching our heads here. new zealand also took issue with trumps tariff logic. we dont have a 20 tariff rate, said trade minister todd mcclay, adding that new zealand was a very low tariff regime and the correct figure was below the 10 baseline rate applied by the u.s. to all countries. we wont be looking to retaliate. that would put up prices on new zealand consumers and it would be inflationary, he said. spared for the moment from the latest round of tariffs were mexico and canada, so far as goods that already qualified under their free trade agreement with the united states. yet, the previously announced 25 tariffs on auto imports were scheduled to take effect at midnight. mexico president claudia sheinbaum said wednesday she would wait to take action on thursday when it was clear how trumps announcement would affect mexico. its not a question of if you impose tariffs on me, im going to impose tariffs on you, she said wednesday morning. our interest is in strengthening the mexican economy. canada had imposed retaliatory tariffs in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, imposed taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including bourbon, prompting trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. little to gain as trump read the list of countries that would be targeted wednesday, he repeatedly said he didnt blame them for the trade barriers they imposed to protect their own nations businesses. but were doing the same thing right now, he said. in the face of unrelenting economic warfare, the united states can no longer continue with a policy of unilateral economic surrender, trump said. speaking from a business forum in india, chilean president gabriel boric warned that such measures, in addition to causing uncertainty, challenge the mutually agreed rules and the principles that govern international trade. colombia president gustavo petro, who has clashed with trump before, said via x that the tariffs marked a global milestone today the neoliberalism that proclaimed free-trade policies all over the world has died. analysts say theres little to be gained from an all-out trade war, neither in the united states or in other countries. once again, trump has put europe at a crossroads, said matteo villa, senior analyst at italys institute for international political studies. if trump really imposes high tariffs, europe will have to respond, but the paradox is that the eu would be better off doing nothing, he added. villa also noted that retaliation would certainly be a further blow to the united states, but it would hurt europe even more, as the eu bloc depends more on exports to the u.s. than vice versa. on the other hand, trump seems to understand only the language of force, and this indicates the need for a strong and immediate response, villa said. probably the hope, in brussels, is that the response will be strong enough to induce trump to negotiate and, soon, to backtrack. __ ap journalists around the world contributed to this story. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: Executives, Trade and Labour Associations on Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-03 09:34:17)
  Content: reuters -u.s. president donald trump said on wednesday he would impose a 10 baseline tariff on all imports to the united states and higher duties on some of the countrys biggest trading partners, a move that could escalate a trade war and upend the global economy. here are latest reactions from company executives, trade and labour associations companies on holding weve taken note of the announced tariffs and are constantly monitoring the evolving situation and continuing policy changes. our global value and supply chain are well-positioned. germanys fresenius we . strongly support pharmaceuticals not being included in the reciprocal tariff proposal, as a blanket tariff would potentially risk shortages of essential medicines for american patients. steel group aperam regarding the limited volumes we export from the eu to the u.s., we will explore on a case by case basis the feasibility of relocating some of our production. unfortunately, the current lack of regulatory predictability creates an unfavorable business environment on both sides of the atlantic. stellantis the carmaker said it would temporarily pause production at some of its canadian and mexican assembly plants, such as its windsor assembly plant in canada. antonio baravalle, ceo, lavazza we had already planned to increase local production in the u.s. to 100. we are ready to go . but now there is this other element that is to be investigated, the duties for brasil . if they put a 10 duty on brazil, the duty of 20 is somehow already halved. the coffee maker currently produces around 50 of what it sells in the u.s. locally. ferrari purchase contracts for ferraris have clear and standard clauses allowing the company to adjust prices in case trade conditions change before the vehicles delivery. new tariffs will also apply to ferrari cars ordered months ago but not yet delivered to the u.s., a company spokesperson said. motofumi shitara, ceo, yamaha motor our exports would certainly be impacted. if these tariffs continue long-term, including for vehicles, we will need to respond by raising prices or reducing costs. maersk we generally expect customers to be a bit more cautious about their inventory levels. in the very short term, were likely to see some rush air freight orders in the u.s. ahead of the announced tariffs going into effect. it is also likely we will see an increase in demand for bonded storage as customers will want to hold off clearing goods while they get more certainty. gerresheimer the tariffs primarily affect our exports from our plant in mexico to the u.s. these include injection vials, for example . we will pass these customs duties on to our clients as additional costs. if necessary and if the customs duties are to remain in place in the longer term, we will also be able to relocate capacities. massimo battaini, ceo, prysmian on first reaction, the announcement appears to have a positive impact on local production. the tariffs will be applied to finished products, and therefore removes the risk that u.s. production could have been undercut from abroad. anders vindegg, head of media relations, hydro we are working actively both from norway and in the eu in brussels to inform and to work actively with the organisations and other measures that were a part of to leverage the importance of norwegian aluminium to europe. associations ipc, a global association for electronics manufacturing we welcome president trumps commitment to strengthening american manufacturing, particularly his focus on revitalizing the defense industrial base. tariffs will not achieve this goal.trade is essential to supply-chain resilience, innovation, and cost competitiveness. without it, tariffs risk raising costs for american businesses and further driving production offshore. retail industry leaders association the presidents plan is not a targeted attempt to protect american innovation or national security but will hit every familys budget. these newly announced tariffs and the expected retaliatory tariffs on american businesses risk destabilizing the u.s. economy, undermining the goals of bolstering domestic manufacturing and growth. european retail industry body eurocommerce eurocommerce calls on eu and u.s. administrations to engage in constructive dialogue. if negotiations fail, the eu has a legal basis to respond to unfair trading practices by third countries. with the anti-coercion instrument, the eu has an extensive toolbox which could help address the situation. international apparel federation the u.s. governments announcement of heavy taxes on its trade with the rest of the world is a major shock to our global apparel industry. it unnecessarily creates a new and often irrational reality affecting billions of dollars of investments and the lives of tens of millions of people working in our industry globally. ultimately, someone will have to pay the price. canadian steel association to reduce our dependency, the canadian steel industry urgently requires the adoption of strict border measures that address unfair steel trade in canada and helps to recapture the canadian market for our industry, our workers and our communities. spanish association of olive oil exporters the spanish olive oil sector is seriously disadvantaged by this 20, compared to 10 for other producing countries not belonging to the european union. 98 of olive oil consumed in the united states comes from imports, so these tariffs will result in a higher purchase price that will have to be borne by u.s. consumers. kevin craven, ceo, ads group, on aerospace components we are absolutely not clear whether that exemption from all tariffs on items that are classified as air worthy by regulators continues and whether these tariffs apply or not. so potentially that might make it more painful. eu farming group copa-cogeca the introduction of additional tariffs threatens to disrupt global supply chains, drive up prices, and limit market access for farmers and agri-cooperatives on both sides of the atlantic, with significant economic consequences for the agricultural sector. anthony brun, head of french cognac growers association ugvc one could have feared much higher tariffs, but this risk is not off the table and remains with a potential conflict over bourbon whiskey. we already face tariffs in china, now there are the u.s., and the consequences will be very brutal to wine growers. sigrid de vries, director general, european automobile manufacturers association we urge our leaders to meet urgently so that they can find a solution to any issues preventing free and fair trade between historic allies and allow the eu-us relationship to flourish once again. swiss business group economiesuisse a further escalation of the trade conflict must be prevented. the federal council and swiss economic diplomacy are called upon to quickly find solutions at the negotiating table with the u.s. government. from an economic perspective, there are no comprehensible reasons for u.s. tariffs against switzerland quite the opposite. dirk jandura, head of germanys exporters association bga we will have to pass these tariffs on as price increases, and that will hit turnover in many cases . this is an economic blind alley at whose end lie welfare losses for both

afford it. donald trump is preparing to unveil a raft of new tariffs on wednesday afternoon in what the president has repeatedly billed as liberation day. trump has promised to roll out reciprocal dollar-for-dollar tariffs on nations that levy duties on u.s. goods as part of an aggressive attempt to fulfill his administrations america first agenda and correct years of what he deems unfair trade. international markets wait tentatively as the president is expected to unveil his plans at 4 p.m. wednesday at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden at the moment american markets close. plans remain under wraps with trumps team reportedly weighing options through tuesday. however, white house press secretary karoline leavitt stated that the president had already decided his course of action and that the tariffs would go into effect almost immediately. the only way to avoid the new levies, she said, is to move production to the u.s. it follows the liberal candidate for a critical seat on the wisconsin supreme court, susan crawford, who defeated conservative brad schimel in a race seen as a referendum on trump and his billionaire adviser elon musk. former republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is on board with an effort by democrats in the upper chamber led by senators tim kaine, amy klobuchar, and mark warner to end donald trumps made-up emergency that the president has declared against canada allowing him authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on the u.s.s northern neighbor. trump claims the authority by declaring a national emergency caused by the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migration from canada as well as mexico and china. president trump is saying that there is an emergency with canada. canada is a friend, not an adversary. canada is a sovereign nation, not a 51st state, senator kaine of virginia said on tuesday. this morning, cnns haley talbot reports that the list of republicans who will vote yes on a tariffs resolution up for a vote today at around 7 p.m. has grown to include the former gop leader of the senate. kaine said he approached mcconnell last night and didnt even get to the question before the kentucky senator said im with you. other republicans in support of the move to at least symbolically rebuke the president on his trade policy just a few hours after his liberation day announcement on reciprocal tariffs expected to cover a large swathe of u.s. trading partners include senators susan collins, lisa murkowski, and rand paul. senator thom tillis also told cnn that he doesnt plan on voting for kaines resolution, but has some concerns with the trade policies being discussed, adding, we need to see what comes out tomorrow wednesday and be instructed by that before we take action. earlier, trump wrote in part on truth social mitch mcconnell of kentucky, susan collins of maine, lisa murkowski of alaska, and rand paul, also of kentucky, will hopefully get on the republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize canada for the sale, into our country, of large amounts of fentanyl, by tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy. they are playing with the lives of the american people, and right into the hands of the radical left democrats and drug cartels. the senate bill is just a ploy of the dems to show and expose the weakness of certain republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the house will never approve it and i, as your president, will never sign it. after breaking the record for the longest senate speech in history, cory booker now seems to have broken the internet, with a slew of praise, memes and even tiktok videos commemorating his mammoth achievement. the new jersey democrat took to the senate floor on monday evening, saying he would remain there as long as he was physically able. the speech lasted a whopping 25 hours and 5 minutes. mike bedigan looks at some of the online reactions. it was fitting that cory booker was recounting a story about the late civil rights leader john lewis as he entered the 19th minute and 24th hour of a historic speech to the senate on tuesday evening. in that moment, the first black senator for new jersey broke a record for the longest speech ever made in congress, one that was set 67 years ago by the segregationist democrat strom thurmond, who spoke for a day and a night in opposition to the civil rights act. overcome with emotion, booker looked up to the ceiling and touched his heart as his fellow democrats in the chamber applauded his effort. one of msnbcs morning joe hosts is delighting in the fact that the wisconsin supreme court candidate

reports from washington, d.c. the u.s. has sent a three-person team to myanmar to help respond to the 7.7-magnitude earthquake, in a move criticized as weak and irrelevant by a former aid official.

by immigration enforcement agents in new york and taken to a detention facility in texas, a nonprofit says as it calls for their release. immigration and customs enforcement officers detained the

this was the most important thing, musk posted on x in response to a post on voter id. madeline sherratt has the full story. kelly loeffler, former georgia senator and now head of the small business administration in the trump administration, hailed donald trumps liberation day as the single greatest salvation, for not just small businesses, but for america, during an appearance on fox business this morning. the president eagerly posted a clip of her conversation with maria bartiromo to his truth social account italys prime minister giorgia meloni and the countrys top business lobby warned on wednesday that impending u.s. tariffs could significantly impact the nations exports and its already struggling economy. it is clear that the introduction of new tariffs would have heavy repercussions for italian producers, meloni said while hosting a prize-giving ceremony for italian cuisine in rome. meloni added that she did not rule out adequate responses to protect the exports of the euro zones third largest economy, though she did not provide further details. italy recorded a trade surplus with the united states of 39 billion euros 42.14 billion in 2024, the third largest in the 20-nation euro area, according to eurostat data. earlier on wednesday, the business association confindustria reported that italys economy is expected to grow by 0.6 this year, half of the governments official target and down from a 0.9 forecast made by the group in october. the economy expanded by a modest 0.7 in both 2024 and 2023. it managed to achieve 0.1 growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the previous three months, after stagnating in the third quarter. most analysts do not foresee any significant rebound in the near term. confindustria indicated that while its forecasts accounted for the already-announced u.s. tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as what it termed record levels of uncertainty regarding trade policy, they did not consider the effects of an escalating trade war. in a worst-case scenario, with permanent 25 u.s. tariffs on all imports, rising to 60 for china, coupled with retaliatory measures against u.s. exports, italys growth could decline to around 0.2 this year, it said. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
