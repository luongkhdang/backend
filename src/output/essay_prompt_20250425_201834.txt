  Title: 100 DAYS OF PUNISHING FOES...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article demonstrates how Trump actively shapes the public's perception by prioritizing certain narratives (e.g., 'political weaponization,' 'lies and abuses') and repeatedly emphasizing them. The text states Trump 'repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate' and 'denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him.' This constant reinforcement influences which issues voters deem important, potentially overshadowing other concerns.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the speed and scope of Trump's actions, noting that 'even the smallest slights drawing reprisals.' This suggests a potential underlying mechanism of personal vendettas driving policy decisions, raising questions about the stability and predictability of the administration's actions. What are the long-term consequences of such personalized governance?; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work.' This raises questions about the ethical implications of such arrangements and whether they constitute a form of extortion or coercion. Does this set a dangerous precedent for future interactions between the government and private entities?

  Content: reuters -hours after swearing an oath to defend the u.s. constitution on january 20, president donald trump signed an executive order directing his attorney general to scour the justice department and other agencies for evidence of political weaponization. the same day, pentagon staff took down a portrait of mark milley, a trump critic who as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been the highest-ranking military officer during trumps first term. that evening, trump stripped his former national security adviser, john bolton - who wrote a memoir critical of trump - of the protective secret service detail he had been given after the justice department said iran had threatened boltons life. in his first 100 days, trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies. these include former intelligence officials who investigated alleged russian ties to his 2016 election campaign and major law firms as well as former biden administration members and prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against him while he was out of power. trumps actions served notice that his campaign promise of political retribution was anything but rhetorical, after he repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate. but the speed and sweep of his actions have caught many by surprise, with even the smallest slights drawing reprisals. the republican president has used the machinery of the state and the power of the presidency to go after people and institutions that have aggrieved him in more expansive ways than any of his predecessors, historians said. its not unusual for presidents to have enemies, said jeremi suri, a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin. what is unusual is for the president to use the entirety of the federal government, not simply to exclude someone, but to directly punish them. trump has made particular use of executive orders - typically used by presidents to direct policy priorities - to target perceived foes by stripping them of security clearances, blocking them from government buildings or directing agencies to probe them for wrongdoing. he has launched multiple federal probes into maine after a verbal spat with the states governor, reached deep into the traditionally independent justice department to fire those he views as disloyal, pulled protective security details from his critics and ordered investigations into former officials who challenged his false claims that his 2020 election loss was rigged. on his first day in office, he removed clearances for 50 former national security officials who had signed a letter suggesting russia was behind a story about salacious material found on a laptop belonging to president joe bidens son hunter. no evidence of russian involvement has emerged. he has also taken away clearances for all three democrats who ran against him in presidential contests biden, hillary clinton and kamala harris. trump has focused much of his attention on the criminal justice system after claiming during his 2024 presidential campaign that his four indictments were motivated by politics. then-president joe bidens administration denied the accusations. in trumps first 100 days, his justice department has fired or demoted dozens of officials, prosecutors and fbi agents, including rank-and-file employees who worked on investigations into trump and the january 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob of trump supporters. in a speech at the justice departments headquarters in february, trump denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him with illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. traditional presidencies have failed to bring meaningful change to the ways of washington, and the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy, a white house spokesman, harrison fields, said in response to questions about trumps retribution efforts and whether they represent an abuse of power. utilizing every tool afforded by the constitution, the trump administration is prioritizing efficiency eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and fulfilling every campaign promise. the ferocity and the scope during his first term, trumps instincts for revenge were sometimes thwarted by his own appointees, many of whom were experienced government hands or establishment republicans. by contrast, trump has filled his second-term administration with steadfast loyalists more likely to back his directives than caution against them. meanwhile, the republican majority in congress has shown little interest in opposing his actions. trump has taken steps as well to eliminate internal watchdogs who might seek to constrain him, purging inspectors general and firing government ethics officials. all administrations, particularly when you see a switch from one party to another, seek to control the executive branch, said historian timothy naftali, the former director of the richard nixon presidential library and museum. its the ferocity and the scope of what hes done that makes it unprecedented. the republican nixon famously had a list of enemies, but he plotted against them in secret. his most aggressive ideas, such as using the tax-collecting internal revenue service to audit his foes, were often blocked by his own officials. other presidents have used their power to penalize rivals in more muted ways, suri said. democrat lyndon johnson sought to discredit his political rival, robert kennedy, in the news media, and republican george w. bush banned brent scowcroft, a former national security adviser, from the white house after scowcroft wrote a column opposing the iraq war. thats often how presidents use their power to go after enemies they keep them out of their administration and spread rumors about them, suri said. trump has frequently intertwined his personal animus against political opponents with his administrations ideological and policy objectives. in february, trump digressed from remarks during a white house meeting with governors to address maine governor janet mills, warning her to comply with an order banning transgender athletes. see you in court, mills, a democrat, replied defiantly. within a day, three separate federal departments had initiated inquiries into whether the state was violating civil rights law, imperiling millions of dollars in federal funding. the justice department sent mills a letter telling her maine was on notice while trump demanded a full-throated apology before the case can be settled. in early april, trumps agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, wrote mills to confirm that some school funding had been frozen. this is only the beginning, rollins warned her. nine days later, the education department said it was taking steps to cut off all federal school funding to the state, and last week attorney general pam bondi announced the justice department had sued maine in federal court. in recent weeks, trump has attacked law firms that once employed attorneys he views as enemies, arguing they undermined the judicial process by doing so. in february, he suspended security clearances for attorneys at the law firm covington burling who had represented smith, the former special counsel investigating him, and sought to cancel any government work the firm had. making little effort to hide his primary motivation, trump suggested sending the pen he used to sign the order to smith as a souvenir. trump has signed executive orders targeting five other law firms, in each case indicating that revenge was an essential factor. his order punishing wilmerhale, for instance, noted that it once employed robert mueller, who investigated whether trumps 2016 campaign had improper connections with russia. nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work on mutually agreed projects backed by the administration. in some cases, trump simply appears determined to get even with former members of his 2017-2021 administration who irked him. this month, the president ordered the justice department to investigate christopher krebs, his former cybersecurity chief who disputed trumps false claims about election fraud in 2020, and miles taylor, a former homeland security official who anonymously wrote a 2019 book critical of trump. signing the executive order targeting the two former officials, trump called taylor a traitor. i think hes guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth, but well find out, he said. dissent isnt unlawful, taylor responded on x. it certainly isnt treasonous. reporting by

  Title: Fake Alpine Quest Mapping App Spotted Spying on Russian Military
  Source: hackread.com (2025-04-22 21:26:10)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Realism, the article highlights the ongoing competition between states (or state-affiliated actors) in the cyber domain. The targeting of Russian military personnel through a compromised app, as evidenced by "fake alpine quest app laced with spyware was used to target russian military android devices, stealing location data, contacts, and sensitive files," demonstrates a pursuit of strategic advantage through intelligence gathering. This suggests a constant state of low-intensity conflict where information is a valuable resource.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that "at the time of writing, the group behind the campaign has not been identified, and it remains unclear whether this operation is domestic or foreign in origin." This lack of immediate attribution, despite similarities to past Ukrainian hacktivist activities, raises questions about the complexity of cyber warfare. Could this ambiguity be intentional, designed to obscure the true source and avoid direct repercussions?

  Content: fake alpine quest app laced with spyware was used to target russian military android devices, stealing location data, contacts, and sensitive files. a malicious version of alpine quest, a popular android navigation app, has been found carrying spyware aimed at russian military personnel. security researchers at doctor web uncovered the modified software embedded with android.spy.1292.origin spyware capable of harvesting data and extending its functionality through remote commands. alpine quest is commonly used by outdoor enthusiasts, but its also relied on by soldiers in russias military zones due to its offline mapping features. that made it a convenient cover for attackers, who repackaged an older version of the app and pushed it as a free download through a fake telegram channel. the link led to an app store targeting russian users, where the infected software was listed as a pro version of the app. once installed, the spyware collects all sorts of information. each time the app is opened, it sends the users phone number, account details, contacts, geolocation, and a list of files stored on the device to a remote server. some of this data is also sent to a telegram bot controlled by the attackers, including updated location details every time the user moves. left telegram channel promoting the malicious alpine quest app in russian via dr. web right english translation of the image using yandex ai, via hackread.com. doctor webs analysis shows that this spyware is capable of more than passive tracking. after identifying which files are available, the malware can be instructed to download new modules designed to extract specific content. based on its behaviour, the attackers appear especially interested in documents shared through messaging apps like telegram and whatsapp. it also seeks out a file called loclog, created by alpine quest itself, which logs user movements in detail. because the spyware is bundled with a working version of the app, it looks and functions normally, giving it time to operate unnoticed. its modular design also means its capabilities can grow over time, depending on the attackers goals. doctor web advises users to avoid downloading apps from unofficial sources, even when they appear to offer free access to paid features. even on official app stores, its best to avoid installing apps you dont truly need. malicious apps have been known to slip past review processes on both google play and the app store. at the time of writing, the group behind the campaign has not been identified, and it remains unclear whether this operation is domestic or foreign in origin. however, similar operations in the past have been linked to ukrainian hacktivist groups, including cyber resistance, also known as the ukrainian cyber alliance. in 2023, they reportedly targeted spouses of russian military personnel, extracting sensitive and personal data. however, there is still no confirmed attribution for the group behind this spyware campaign.

  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism is relevant here. The article illustrates how a shift in the U.S. administration's policies and rhetoric, specifically "steep trade tariffs" and "suggestions that canada should become a u.s. state," directly impacts Canada's economic and social well-being. This aligns with Realism's emphasis on states acting in their self-interest and the pursuit of power, leading to a competitive and sometimes conflictual international environment. The resulting "chill that has blanketed relations" and the economic consequences for both countries demonstrate the core tenets of Realist thought.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that some Canadians are "quietly preparing to let go of their second homes" but "holding back to see how things play out." This suggests a level of uncertainty and a potential for further shifts in behavior depending on future political developments. What specific political or economic indicators are these Canadians monitoring, and what threshold would trigger a more widespread exodus?; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the economic reliance of South Florida on Canadian snowbirds, stating they "either own property and pay property tax or rent for the winter months - either way, a boost to the economy." However, it doesn't quantify the overall economic impact or explore potential mitigation strategies. What percentage of South Florida's economy is directly attributable to Canadian snowbirds, and what alternative revenue streams are being considered to offset the potential loss?

      > Snippet: canadians spent close to 6 billion on u.s. real estate from april 2023 to march 2024 - making up 13 of all foreign transactions - more than any other nationality
  Content: by doyinsola oladipo and mrinalika roy reuters -the number of canadian snowbirds planning to sell their second homes in sunny florida and arizona has surged this spring, many of them put off by the sudden chill that has blanketed relations between their homeland and the u.s. real estate agents say they are seeing more canadians cashing out, further softening property prices in warm-weather states that have long attracted retirees and tourists from cold and snowy canada. canadians spent close to 6 billion on u.s. real estate from april 2023 to march 2024 - making up 13 of all foreign transactions - more than any other nationality, according to data from the national association of realtors. nearly half of the homes purchased by canadians were for vacation purposes, with florida, arizona and hawaii ranking as the top markets. last week, tracy and dale mcmullen sold their vacation home in buckeye, arizona, a property they owned for five years. the alberta residents, who usually spend four to five months in arizona a year, said they are not planning to come back. we decided to sell the property after the current potus took office, said dale, referring to u.s. president donald trump, who was inaugurated for the second time in january. it was time to leave. we felt we could not trust what he might do next to us as individuals and to our country. we no longer felt welcome nor safe. canadians are feeling stung by the actions and words of the trump administration, which has imposed steep trade tariffs on its northern neighbor, threatening canadas export-dependent economy. trumps repeated suggestions that canada should become a u.s. state, and his derogatory references to now-former prime minister justin trudeau as governor have annoyed canadians and offended their national pride. as a result, many canadians are boycotting u.s.-made goods, such as bourbon and produce and canceling trips to u.s. destinations. canadian return flights from the u.s. fell 13.5 in march from a year earlier, according to statistics canada. canadian-resident return trips by automobile fell about 32. real estate is now facing a similar pullback in demand. laurie lavine, a realtor in arizona who helped the mcmullens with their sale, told reuters that he currently has 18 listings from canadians looking to sell, compared with the usual two to four per quarter. trade friction and the current weakness of the canadian dollar are also contributing to the pullback, lavine said. canadians are also feeling picked on, with u.s. border agents enforcing stricter rules on entering the country, he added. beginning this month, the trump administration is requiring all foreigners 14 or older to register and submit fingerprints if they stay beyond 30 days. canadians, who previously could visit for up to six months without a visa, are subject to the new requirement. the sour feelings that many canadians suddenly feel toward the u.s. are having a big impact on the property market in florida, one of the closest warm-weather states to ontario and quebec, canadas most populous provinces. south floridas residential market has for decades been reliant on the annual influx of canadian snowbirds who either own property and pay property tax or rent for the winter months - either way, a boost to the economy, said ermengarde jabir, a director of economic research at moodys analytics. the first quarter is typically the peak buying season for condominiums in the region, coinciding with when many snowbirds are in town, said andrea hartmann, managing partner of the sandy hartmann group, a real estate firm in the tampa bay area. since the beginning of the year we have not received an offer from a canadian buyer even once, and normally we would, she said. floridas housing market is already reeling. prospective buyers have faced rising insurance premiums, concerns over climate change and a series of devastating hurricanes in recent years. in the tampa-st. petersburg-clearwater region, mortgage lock volume for second homes - or the number of buyers securing rates ahead of purchases - fell 25 on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2025, according to optimal blue, a mortgage technology and data company. now with the political issue, the cost of maintaining a place here in florida and the insurance, a lot of them decided to sell and go, said ken obrian, owner of southwest coast realty in naples, which has specialized in helping canadians purchase properties in florida for about 20 years. there is no incentive to come to the states anymore, said donny b., a native of ontario who is looking to sell his two investment properties in florida. like many snowbirds interviewed for this story, he declined to give his surname, saying he feared backlash. he said he decided to sell because of the political uncertainty, the exchange rate and concern about whether floridians would still welcome canadians in the current climate. i got down here on wednesday and i was nervous. im like, are people going to be pissed off at me? other states have started to see an exodus as well. agents in los angeles and palm springs, california, are working with canadian sellers who are quietly preparing to let go of their second homes, said fatima malik, global real estate advisor at engel volkers beverly hills. some are holding back to see how things play out, but others are already shifting their sights toward places like portugal, mexico, and parts of france, she added. reporting by doyinsola oladipo in new york and mrinalika roy in bengaluru editing by frank mcgurty and paul simao

  Title: Trump ‘Liberation Day’ live: President set to unveil secret tariff plan as world braces for its economic impact
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-02 14:47:57)
  Content: all eyes are on president trump as he prepares to reveal the next phase of his sweeping tariff agenda, leaving global markets fearing a trade war from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. donald trump is preparing to unveil a raft of new tariffs on wednesday afternoon in what the president has repeatedly billed as liberation day. trump has promised to roll out reciprocal dollar-for-dollar tariffs on nations that levy duties on u.s. goods as part of an aggressive attempt to fulfill his administrations america first agenda and correct years of what he deems unfair trade. international markets wait tentatively as the president is expected to unveil his plans at 4 p.m. wednesday at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden at the moment american markets close. plans remain under wraps with trumps team reportedly weighing options through tuesday. however, white house press secretary karoline leavitt stated that the president had already decided his course of action and that the tariffs would go into effect almost immediately. the only way to avoid the new levies, she said, is to move production to the u.s. it follows the liberal candidate for a critical seat on the wisconsin supreme court, susan crawford, who defeated conservative brad schimel in a race seen as a referendum on trump and his billionaire adviser elon musk. former republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is on board with an effort by democrats in the upper chamber led by senators tim kaine, amy klobuchar, and mark warner to end donald trumps made-up emergency that the president has declared against canada allowing him authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on the u.s.s northern neighbor. trump claims the authority by declaring a national emergency caused by the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migration from canada as well as mexico and china. president trump is saying that there is an emergency with canada. canada is a friend, not an adversary. canada is a sovereign nation, not a 51st state, senator kaine of virginia said on tuesday. this morning, cnns haley talbot reports that the list of republicans who will vote yes on a tariffs resolution up for a vote today at around 7 p.m. has grown to include the former gop leader of the senate. kaine said he approached mcconnell last night and didnt even get to the question before the kentucky senator said im with you. other republicans in support of the move to at least symbolically rebuke the president on his trade policy just a few hours after his liberation day announcement on reciprocal tariffs expected to cover a large swathe of u.s. trading partners include senators susan collins, lisa murkowski, and rand paul. senator thom tillis also told cnn that he doesnt plan on voting for kaines resolution, but has some concerns with the trade policies being discussed, adding, we need to see what comes out tomorrow wednesday and be instructed by that before we take action. earlier, trump wrote in part on truth social mitch mcconnell of kentucky, susan collins of maine, lisa murkowski of alaska, and rand paul, also of kentucky, will hopefully get on the republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize canada for the sale, into our country, of large amounts of fentanyl, by tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy. they are playing with the lives of the american people, and right into the hands of the radical left democrats and drug cartels. the senate bill is just a ploy of the dems to show and expose the weakness of certain republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the house will never approve it and i, as your president, will never sign it. after breaking the record for the longest senate speech in history, cory booker now seems to have broken the internet, with a slew of praise, memes and even tiktok videos commemorating his mammoth achievement. the new jersey democrat took to the senate floor on monday evening, saying he would remain there as long as he was physically able. the speech lasted a whopping 25 hours and 5 minutes. mike bedigan looks at some of the online reactions. it was fitting that cory booker was recounting a story about the late civil rights leader john lewis as he entered the 19th minute and 24th hour of a historic speech to the senate on tuesday evening. in that moment, the first black senator for new jersey broke a record for the longest speech ever made in congress, one that was set 67 years ago by the segregationist democrat strom thurmond, who spoke for a day and a night in opposition to the civil rights act. overcome with emotion, booker looked up to the ceiling and touched his heart as his fellow democrats in the chamber applauded his effort. one of msnbcs morning joe hosts is delighting in the fact that the wisconsin supreme court candidate backed by elon musks lost - even after the tech mogul dumped millions into the race. wisconsin voters elected liberal justice susan crawford to the states supreme court on tuesday, beating brad schimel by more than 200,000 votes in the most expensive judicial election in u.s. history. the vote keeps the high courts 4-3 liberal majority intact. musk repeatedly played up the stakes of the election, claiming it will direct the destiny of humanity and the future of the world is at stake. now, morning joe host joe scarborough is reveling in the massive loss musk suffered. katie hawkinson reports from washington, d.c. the u.s. has sent a three-person team to myanmar to help respond to the 7.7-magnitude earthquake, in a move criticized as weak and irrelevant by a former aid official. much larger russian and chinese teams have already been helping search-and-rescue efforts in the country for days. steffie banatvala reports. a mother and her three children were wrongfully detained by immigration enforcement agents in new york and taken to a detention facility in texas, a nonprofit says as it calls for their release. immigration and customs enforcement officers detained the mother - whose birth country was not disclosed - and her kids, one of whom is in third grade, on march 27 while they were executing an arrest on a farm in sackets harbor, new york, according to the new york immigration coalition. kelly rissman reports. elon musk broke his silence after suffering defeat in the wisconsin supreme court race, which cemented a liberal majority for the next three years. susan crawfords win keeps the court under a 4-3 liberal majority in the face of crucial litigation surrounding abortion access, voting rights and redistricting. like president donald trump, musk chose to focus on the background win of wisconsin voters approving the constitutional amendment to enshrine voter id laws, a vote that was being held at the same time as the supreme court race. this was the most important thing, musk posted on x in response to a post on voter id. madeline sherratt has the full story. kelly loeffler, former georgia senator and now head of the small business administration in the trump administration, hailed donald trumps liberation day as the single greatest salvation, for not just small businesses, but for america, during an appearance on fox business this morning. the president eagerly posted a clip of her conversation with maria bartiromo to his truth social account italys prime minister giorgia meloni and the countrys top business lobby warned on wednesday that impending u.s. tariffs could significantly impact the nations exports and its already struggling economy. it is clear that the introduction of new tariffs would have heavy repercussions for italian producers, meloni said while hosting a prize-giving ceremony for italian cuisine in rome. meloni added that she did not rule out adequate responses to protect the exports of the euro zones third largest economy, though she did not provide further details. italy recorded a trade surplus with the united states of 39 billion euros 42.14 billion in 2024, the third largest in the 20-nation euro area, according to eurostat data. earlier on wednesday, the business association confindustria reported that italys economy is expected to grow by 0.6 this year, half of the governments official target and down from a 0.9 forecast made by the group in october. the economy expanded by a modest 0.7 in both 2024 and 2023. it managed to achieve 0.1 growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the previous three months, after stagnating in the third quarter. most analysts do not foresee any significant rebound in the near term. confindustria indicated that while its forecasts accounted for the already-announced u.s. tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as what it termed record levels of uncertainty regarding trade policy, they did not consider the effects of an escalating trade war. in a worst-case scenario, with permanent 25 u.s. tariffs on all imports, rising to 60 for china, coupled with retaliatory measures against u.s. exports, italys growth could decline to around 0.2 this year, it said. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Analysis-Trump Uses Power Against Foes Unlike Any Other Modern US President
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-02 05:05:38)
  Content: by james oliphant and jeff mason washington reuters -in just 10 weeks in office, donald trump has imposed his will on perceived adversaries in business, politics, the media and allied nations by leveraging power in ways no other modern u.s. president has tried. his administration has sought the arrest and deportation of student protesters, withheld federal funds from colleges, ostracized law firms tied to his political opponents, threatened judges and tried to pressure journalists. at the same time trump has downsized the federal government dramatically and purged it of workers who could stand in his way. central to this effort has been trumps use of policy-making executive orders to target opponents as never before. he has been unafraid to employ lawsuits, public threats and the power of the federal purse to bring institutions to heel. what unites all these efforts is trumps desire to shut down every potential source of resistance to the maga agenda and to his personal power, said peter shane, a law professor at new york university. some targets have rushed to placate the president, a few have fought back and many are still trying to figure out how to respond. many of trumps actions are being challenged in courts, where some judges have tried to slow him down. the stunning speed and breadth of the republican presidents actions have caught democrats, public-service unions, ceos and the legal profession off guard. trumps supporters say he is simply using the full reach of his presidency to achieve the goals he set as a candidate. hes laid out these broad battle lines, whether its with people that he thinks have tried to ruin him personally, whether its with people he thinks have tried to ruin western civilization, said republican strategist scott jennings, a longtime adviser to senator mitch mcconnell. everything he said he was going to do on the campaign, hes doing. trumps aims are not just political. his actions show he wants to reorder american society with an all-powerful executive at the top, where financial, political and cultural institutions carry his stamp and where opposition is either co-opted or curtailed. with a compliant congress controlled by his party and a u.s. supreme court dominated by conservatives, trump is operating with fewer checks on his power than any of his modern-day predecessors. trump has attempted to subdue and cajole his adversaries on an almost-daily basis, backed by the fearsome might of the law enforcement and regulatory agencies at his command. he has often succeeded. he managed to wring concessions out of several of his targets, including storied columbia university, powerful law firms and corporate titans such as meta and disney. all of them settled with the white house rather than endure the pressure, surrendering some independence and setting what some view as damaging precedents. others are taking preemptive measures to avoid trumps wrath. more than 20 of americas largest companies and financial firms, including goldman sachs, google and pepsico, have rolled back diversity programs that had drawn trumps ire. three law firms cut deals with the administration rather than risk losing their lawyers security clearances, access to government buildings and perhaps, as a result, clients, while three others targeted by trumps executive orders sued in response. trumps orders have also been his vehicle to remake the government, deport alleged venezuelan gang members with little due process and levy tariffs against u.s. trading partners. he has sued u.s. media corporations and silenced the voice of america, taken control of the kennedy center, a leading arts facility, and sought to put curbs on the smithsonian institution, whose mission is to chronicle history. his administration has detained student protesters whose political views it says are a threat to the country. trump has pushed a mineral-rights deal on ukraines leadership with the veiled threat of ending u.s. support for kyiv in the russian war in ukraine. he has threatened nato ally denmark to try to wrest control of greenland, spoken of annexing canada and threatened to take the panama canal back from its home country. tailored strikes mark zaid, a washington lawyer who represents whistleblowers against the federal government and who himself had his security clearance stripped away by trump, said the presidents conduct is like nothing he has seen in his 30-year career. executive orders have never been designed to specifically target individuals nor non-government actors for purposes of retaliation or retribution, zaid said. the white house and trumps allies deny the president is acting out of revenge. a white house spokesman said more traditional approaches have failed to bring meaningful change. unconventional is precisely what the american people voted for when they elected president trump, white house spokesman harrison fields said. the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy. in his first term from 2017-2021, trump was hamstrung by a variety of factors a federal probe into russian interference, his aides lack of experience and greater democratic opposition in congress. with those roadblocks gone, an emboldened trump has demonstrated at the start of his second term that he has learned how to use the resources available to him more fully to get what he wants. he really does know how to pull the levers of power this time, more so than last time, said rina shah, a republican strategist. claire wofford, a political science professor at the college of charleston, said trump has used executive orders not only to push forward a policy agenda, but also to send messages to his political base, as in his attempt to scale back birthright citizenship, and to test the limits of his power, as with his invocation of an 18th-century law to designate some migrants as alien enemies. what strikes me most at this point is how strategic trump is - but in new ways, wofford said. funding and litigation in cases such as with columbia university, trump has used the federal purse as a cudgel, concluding his targets have financial interests that make them vulnerable to coercion. in other cases, he has used the courts, forcing companies such as disney and meta into favorable settlements after trump filed lawsuits against them. cbs news, another trump lawsuit target, is under pressure to settle its suit because its parent, paramount, is eager to have its proposed merger with skydance media approved by trump administration regulators. but not every institution has bent the knee. many of trumps actions, particularly those regarding his cuts in government, remain tied up in federal court. in the last two weeks alone, judges have ruled against trump in matters challenging his deportation policies, attacks against law firms and plans to eliminate government agencies. in response, trump and his allies have called for judges who rule against the administration to be impeached and drawn a rare rebuke from chief justice john roberts. walter olson, a senior fellow at the libertarian cato institute, said trumps attacks on law firms and judges are without precedent and are reminiscent of other nations with authoritarian regimes. clipping the wings of law firms and the courts, olson said, is the behavior of an autocrat. reporting by james oliphant and jeff masonediting by colleen jenkins and howard goller

  Title: Republican backlash to Trump tariffs grows as Senate rebels decry ‘bad policy’
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-03 17:29:12)
  Content: the first signs of an internal us political backlash against donald trumps declaration of a global trade war are starting to emerge amid tanking stock markets worldwide, including on wall street, and widespread international criticism of the move. hours after trump unveiled a sweeping panoply of tariffs in an event he dubbed liberation day, four republican senators openly defied him by voting for a senate resolution from democrats demanding that the 25 tariffs on canadian products be reversed. the resolution lacks the force of law but its support from mitch mcconnell and rand paul, both of kentucky, susan collins of maine, and lisa murkowski of alaska, immediately signaled the deep misgivings among some republicans over trumps tariff gambit, which has triggered a global sell-off. mcconnell, the former senate majority leader, issued a scathing denunciation after wednesday evenings vote, calling tariffs bad policy that would trigger economic hardship. trade wars with our partners hurt working people most, he said in a statement. tariffs drive up the cost of goods and services. they are a tax on everyday working americans. further criticism came from trumps former vice-president, mike pence, who called the tariffs the largest peacetime tax hike in us history. these tariffs are nearly 10 times the size of those imposed during the trump-pence administration, and will cost american families over 3,500 per year, he posted. the four republicans who voted with democrats did so despite a public appeal from trump not to support the resolution, tabled by tim kaine, a democratic senator for virginia who was hillary clintons running mate in the 2016 presidential election, which trump won. the resolution was aimed at curtailing the powers trump claimed under the international emergency economic powers act, which he has invoked to tackle the uss 1.2tn trade deficit and, in the case of canada, cited the influx of fentanyl through its border. mcconnell pulled no punches in his attack on trumps policy. preserving the long-term prosperity of american industry and workers requires working with our allies, not against them. with so much at stake globally, the last thing we need is to pick fights with the very friends with whom we should be working with to protect against chinas predatory and unfair trade practices, he said. he added at a time when americans are tightening their belts, we would do well to avoid policies that heap on the pain. we ought to strengthen our friendships abroad, and reinforce our allies as pillars of american prosperity and security. paul, his fellow kentuckian, said the tariffs were unconstitutional. our constitution was very specific that taxes tariffs are a tax taxes originate in the house, come to the senate and then go the president, he told reporters. they dont just go to the president and no one else. what kind of system would it be if all of our taxes and laws were passed by one person? he later told fox news trade is proportional to wealth. the last 70 years of international trade has been an exponential curve upwards, and the last 70 years of prosperity has been upwards also. we are richer because of trade with canada, and so is canada. collins, the senator for maine, said tariffs would damage lobstering, agriculture and the pulp and paper industries in her state, which borders canada. she also lambasted imposing tariffs on us allies. the fact is, the vast majority of fentanyl in america comes from the southern border rather than from canada, she said on the senate floor. one of my biggest concerns is we should be distinguishing between allies and our adversaries and not treating them the same way. murkowski, a senator from alaska, said tariffs would also hurt her state and urged trump to find a better way to mutually secure our borders and address fentanyl trafficking than by starting a trade war. while not all canadian trade practices are fair, im keenly aware of the negative impacts in store for alaskan families and businesses should tariffs drive up the costs of essential goods, she posted on x. in alaska we share more than 1,538 miles of border with canada. we are friends, neighbors, partners, and allies when it comes to our economies, our mutual defense, our cultures, and, yes, our trade. the outspoken republican criticism hinted at a wider unease in the party that is mostly being kept muted for fear of repercussions from trump. thom tillis, a republican senator for north carolina, warned about potential irreparable damage to his farming constituents before wednesdays announcement. anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right need to talk to my farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy, he told cnn. they dont have time. so weve got to be crisp on this implementation. john thune, the republican senate majority leader, tried to reconcile his concerns with loyalty to trump. ive got my issue. i represent a state that is very dependent upon exports, he told reporters. but i do appreciate the presidents focus on making sure were getting better deals, and giving business an incentive to do business here in the united states. such equivocation contrasted with unambiguous condemnation from democrats, some of whom openly lauded the republican anti-tariff rebels. this is what happens when people speak up, posted the new jersey senator, cory booker, citing images of news headlines about the four senators votes and obliquely referencing his record-breaking senate floor speech this week denouncing trumps policies. chuck schumer, the democratic leader in the senate, posted 54 tariffs on china, 10 tariffs on iran, 0 tariffs on russia alongside a puzzled emoji. brian schatz, a hawaii senator and the democrats chief whip, posted ive never seen a president ruin the economy on purpose. responding, chris murphy, the outspoken connecticut senator who has emerged as an articulate advocate of the need for a democratic anti-trump fightback, wrote this is the thing to understand. its all on purpose. creating chaos and crisis.

  Title: Trump Advisers Say 50-Plus Countries Have Reached Out for Tariff Talks With White House
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-06 18:32:26)
  Content: fort lauderdale, fla. ap top administration officials said sunday that more than 50 countries targeted by president donald trumps new tariffs have reached out to begin negotiations over the sweeping import taxes that have sent financial markets reeling, raised fears of a recession and upended the global trading system. the higher rates are set to be collected beginning wednesday, ushering in a new era of economic uncertainty with no clear end in sight. treasury secretary scott bessent said unfair trade practices are not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks. the united states, he said, must see what the countries offer and whether its believable. trump, who spent the weekend in florida playing golf, posted online that we will win. hang tough, it wont be easy. his cabinet members and economic advisers were out in force sunday defending the tariffs and downplaying the consequences for the global economy. there doesnt have to be a recession. who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week? bessent said. what we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity. trumps tariff blitz, announced april 2, fulfilled a key campaign promise as he acted without congress to redraw the rules of global trade. it was a move decades in the making for trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the u.s. he is gambling that voters will be willing to endure higher prices for everyday items to enact his economic vision. countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with china and others retaliating quickly. top white house economic adviser kevin hassett acknowledged that other countries are angry and retaliating, and, he said, by the way, coming to the table. he cited the office of the u.s. trade representative as reporting that more than 50 nations had reached out to the white house to begin talks. adding to the turmoil, the new tariffs are hitting american allies and adversaries alike, including israel, which is facing a 17 tariff. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is set to visit the white house monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion with trump along with the war in gaza and other issues. another american ally, vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs. trump said vietnams leader said in a telephone call that his country wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s. and a key european partner, italian premier giorgia meloni, said she disagreed with trumps move but was ready to deploy all the tools negotiating and economic necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized. commerce secretary howard lutnick made clear there was no postponing tariffs that are days away. the tariffs are coming. of course they, he said, adding that trump needed to reset global trade. but he committed only to having them definitely remain for days and weeks. in congress, where trumps republican party has long championed free trade, the tariff regiment has been met with applause but also significant unease. several republican senators have already signed onto a new bipartisan bill that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to congress. lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. wyomings john barrasso, the no. 2 member of the senates gop leadership, said trump is doing what he has every right to do. but, he acknowledged, there is concern, and theres concern across the country. people are watching the markets. therell be a discussion in the senate, barrasso said of the tariffs. well see which way the discussion goes. trumps government cost-cutting guru, billionaire businessman elon musk, had been relatively silent on trumps tariffs, but said at a weekend event in italy that he would like to see the u.s. and europe move to a zero-tariff situation. the comment from the tesla owner who leads trumps department of government efficiency drew a rebuke from white house trade adviser peter navarro. elon, when he is on his doge lane, is great. but we understand whats going on here. we just have to understand. elon sells cars, navarro said. he added hes simply protecting his own interest as any business person would do. lawrence summers, an economist who was treasury secretary under democratic president bill clinton, said trump and his economic team are sending contradictory messages if they say they are interested in reviving manufacturing while still being open to negotiating with trade partners. if other countries eliminate their tariffs, and the u.s, does, too, he said, its just making a deal, then we dont raise any revenue nor do we get any businesses to relocate to the united states. if its a permanent revenue source and trying to get businesses to relocate to the united states, then were going to have these tariffs permanently. so the president cant have it both ways. bessent was on nbcs meet the press, hassett and summers appeared on abcs this week, lutnick and barrasso were on cbs face the nation and navarro was interviewed on fox news channels sunday morning futures. ______ associated press writers giada zampano in rome and fatima hussein in jupiter, florida, contributed to this report. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

points on trumps 10 across-the-board tariff on almost all us imports, with higher rates targeted at about 60 countries. if the intention was to calm nerves with a clear statement of intent, then it backfired as top officials gave starkly contrasting signals. howard lutnick, the billionaire commerce secretary, struck an aggressive note on cbs newss face the nation in which he portrayed the tariffs as here to stay. asked whether there was a chance that tariffs would be postponed to allow countries to negotiate a deal with washington, he replied there is no postponing they are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks, that is sort of obvious. lutnick added that trump intended to reset global trade. the president has made it crystal, crystal clear, he said. however, two other cabinet members gave the opposite take, suggesting that negotiations with individual countries were very much on the cards. scott bessent, the treasury secretary, told meet the press on nbc news that trump had created maximum leverage for himself, and more than 50 countries have approached the administration about lowering their non-tariff trade barriers, lowering their tariffs, stopping currency manipulation. the agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, echoed bessent by flagging up possible talks. weve got 50 countries that are burning the phone lines into the white house, she told cnns state of the union. the scale of trumps tariffs have sent shockwaves around the world, catching us investors as well as top republican politicians by surprise. in just two days last week, more than 6tn was wiped off wall streets market value. trump told us consumers in a post on his truth social network to hang tough, it wont be easy, but the end result will be historic. yet as he spent the weekend golfing at his mar-a-lago resort in florida, his unprecedented tax increase goaded senior republicans to speak out, in a vanishingly rare display of criticism of their leader. trumps former vice-president, mike pence, denounced the tariffs as the largest peacetime tax hike in us history. thom tillis, the republican senator from north carolina, said anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right needs to talk to farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy. ted cruz, a senator from texas, warned of a bloodbath for republicans in the 2026 midterm elections should the tariffs force the us into recession. democrats are detecting opportunity in such unusual challenges to trump from within his own party. adam schiff, the democratic senator from california, floated on meet the press what sounded like a draft campaign strategy for the midterms. if we head into a recession, it will be the trump recession, he said. of trump, schiff also said hes wrecking our economy. tim walz, the governor of minnesota who ran as the democrats vice-presidential candidate in last novembers defeat to trump, called the tariffs really, really terrifying on state of the union. he warned that if you punish dependable trading partners like mexico and canada, they dont come back overnight. as the tariffs kick in, analysts are increasingly pointing to the chances of a recession, which is normally assessed as being two consecutive quarters of falling gdp. the head of economic research at jp morgan, bruce kasman, has raised the probability of global recession to 60, a figure that he included in a memo titled there will be blood. larry summers, the us treasury secretary during bill clintons presidency, called the tariffs the biggest self-inflicted wound weve put on our economy in history. speaking on abc newss this week, he gave his own estimate of the total loss to us consumers at 30tn equivalent to doubling petrol prices at the pump. skip past

attempted to use rhetorical devices as a way of assuaging rattled investors and consumers. rollins said the markets werent crashing they were adjusting. asked what he would say to americans close to retirement who had just watched their lifetime savings drop significantly in recent days, bessent called that a false narrative. americans who want to retire right now, they dont look at the day-to-day fluctuations of whats happening, bessent said. bessents answer was coloured, perhaps, by his own net worth, which has been put at more than 521m. there were moments of the surreal in the exchanges between trumps top officials and the political show hosts. asked by cnns jake tapper why 10 tariffs had been placed on heard island and mcdonald islands, which are populated by penguins near antarctica but no humans, rollins said i mean, come on, whatever. listen, the people that are leading this are serious, intentional, patriotic the smartest people ive ever worked with. tapper then pushed back on the agriculture secretarys justification for the 20 reciprocal tariffs that have been imposed on eu goods sold to the us. rollins said that honduras bought more pork from the us than the entire european union. tapper pointed out that the eu had tight restrictions on hormone use in livestock production. the eu banned use of synthetic hormones in 1981, and blocked imports of animals that had been treated in that way. rollins then accused the eu of using fake science to prohibit us products. thats just absolute bull, she said. we produce the safest, the most secure, the best food in the world.

street opened on thursday morning after donald trump unveiled his latest wave of tariffs on what the president called liberation day. trumps announcement sent shockwaves through markets around the globe, and shortly after the bell rang at the new york stock exchange, the dow jones industrial average fell 1,150 points or 2.7. the sp 500 dropped more than 3, and the tech-focused nasdaq more than 4.2. the president announced that blanket 10 percent tariffs will be imposed on all nations in a speech at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden shortly after regular trading hours closed in the u.s. about 60 countries deemed the worst offenders including china where a majority of apples devices are manufactured face higher reciprocal levies nearing, in some cases, 50 percent leaving world leaders reeling. the baseline tariffs go into effect on saturday and reciprocal tariffs on wednesday. meanwhile, four republican senators joined every democratic senator in a

donald trumps ability to impose tariffs and requiring congressional approval for new levies within 60 days. republican senator chuck grassley and democrat maria cantwell presented a bill that mandates the president to notify congress about new tariffs, providing an explanation of the rationale along with an analysis of the potential impact on u.s. businesses and consumers. congress must pass a joint resolution of approval for the new tariff within 60 days otherwise, all new tariffs on imports would expire. this bill reasserts congress role over trade policy to ensure rules-based trade policies are transparent, consistent, and benefit the american public, cantwell said. as representatives of the american people, congress has a duty to stop actions that will cause them harm. the bill is based on the war powers resolution of 1973 and aims to reestablish limits on the presidents authority to impose unilateral tariffs without congressional approval. for too long, congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch, grassley said. grassleys home state of iowa relies significantly on farm crop exports, whereas cantwells washington state hosts many export-driven companies like boeing. the senate passed legislation on wednesday that would terminate new tariffs on canada. with reporting from reuters the

  Title: Trump's agenda grapples with political and economic reality - BBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-05 00:02:40)
  Content: donald trump, in announcing his sweeping new tariffs on us imports on wednesday, promised that the history books would record 2 april as americas liberation day. after two days of stock market turmoil, however, this may also be remembered as the week the presidents second-term agenda ran headfirst into economic - and political - reality. us stocks have been in a tailspin since trump unveiled his tariffs at wednesday afternoons white house rose garden event, with signs that americas trading partners - canada, the european union and china, most notably - are not backing away from a fight. meanwhile, other presidential efforts, on foreign policy and immigration, and at the ballot box - have faced notable setbacks in recent days. the white house on thursday felt a bit like a building battening down for a coming storm. the four big posters showing americas reciprocal tariffs on a long list of countries were on prominent display in the press briefing room, but administration officials available to respond to media questions were few and far between. out on pennsylvania avenue, workers unloaded pallets of metal fencing, which will ring the white house grounds in preparation for what officials anticipate to be a large anti-trump demonstration at the nearby washington monument on saturday. the first lady announced that a white house garden tour event that had been scheduled for that day was postponed because of security concerns. even the normally loquacious president stopped only briefly to talk with the crush of reporters on his way to board the marine one helicopter on the first leg of his journey to florida. i said this would be exactly the way it is, he declared when asked about the days stock market turmoil. the markets - and america as a whole - would soon boom, he said. the president, it seems, is willing to wait out the tempest created by his tariff plan. he appears confident that his economic vision of a rebuilt, job-rich american manufacturing sector protected from foreign competition - a vision he has closely held for decades - will ultimately be proven right. the trump agendas close encounter with cold, hard reality wasnt limited to trade this week, however. his two top foreign policy priorities - ending the wars in gaza and ukraine - both appear mired in the kind of messy details and conflicting agendas that often obstruct lasting peace. israel has once again moved into gaza and escalated a bombing campaign that is generating reports of widespread civilian casualties. the ceasefire that trump touted in the days before he took office appears to be in tatters. russia, meanwhile, continues to pile new conditions on to negotiations for a full ceasefire with ukraine, which is an indication that the nation may be buying time to allow its ground forces to take more territory. if i think theyre tapping us along, i will not be happy about it, trump said of russia. but he added that he still believes president vladimir putin wants to make a deal. evidence so far indicates the contrary, according to jake sullivan, who was president joe bidens national security adviser. in an interview with the bbc, he accused trump of handing russia most of its demands, though he acknowledged it was still early in the process and things could yet change. so the current dynamic in these negotiations a is not in fact producing russian willingness to reach a fair and just compromise, but b is actually stimulating a view in moscow that if they just keep holding out, theyre just going to keep getting concessions from the united states. and so far that is what has happened. even trumps deportation and immigration enforcement efforts, which still have high public support, have been at least partially derailed by legal challenges. while his administration has successfully completed several flights transferring alleged tren de aragua venezuelan gang members to an el salvadoran high-security prison, the judge presiding over a case challenging those deportations said on thursday there was a fair likelihood officials had violated his court order to turn the flights around. other court challenges - to trumps suspension of political asylum processing and refugee resettlement, his attempt to end birthright citizenship and his revocation of temporary protected status for about 350,000 venezuelans - are currently working their way through the us legal system. at some point, the us supreme court is expected to weigh in on many of these disputes. this week also marked the biggest round of elections since trumps november 2024 victory, as voters headed to the polls in wisconsin to elect a state judge and in two florida special elections for seats in the house of representatives. while the republican candidates in florida prevailed, their winning margins were about 15, which is about half of what trump posted in those congressional districts in november. in wisconsin, a key political battleground state, the democratic-backed candidate won. democrats were able to maintain the liberal majority on the court despite the tens of millions of dollars spent by conservative groups, including by tech billionaire elon musk, who campaigned there in person. taken as a whole the results suggest that democrats are doing well in hotly contested races and may be making inroads even in reliably conservative areas - in part by campaigning against musk and his efforts to massively cut federal programmes and staff. that could be an indication that the party will have the political wind at their backs in state elections this november and the midterm congressional elections next year. the stock market tumult, and those ballot-box results, may be behind a few scattered signs of dissent within republican ranks. ted cruz, an arch-conservative senator from texas, said on his podcast on friday that trumps tariffs could hurt jobs and could hurt america - particularly if other nations retaliate, as china has already done. if were in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now, with massive american tariffs, and massive tariffs on american goods in every other country on earth, that is a terrible outcome, he continued. on wednesday night in the us senate, four republicans joined with democrats to support rescinding the emergency declaration that justifies trumps earlier canada tariffs. and on thursday, republican senator chuck grassley of iowa joined with democrat maria cantwell of washington to back a measure that would require congress to directly approve tariffs that stay in effect longer than 60 days. republicans by and large have been sticking with the president. they seem unwilling, or unable, to sway trump from his current course on tariffs and government cuts and appear fearful of the political consequences of breaking with the man who has a vise-like grip on the party. but if the current economic shock becomes a long-term hardship, and if government programme cuts translate into tangible disruptions in popular services or if trumps standing in opinion polls continues to sag, members of his own party may begin eyeing the exit signs for the first time in years. and that would bring an unceremonious end to some of trumps most ambitious efforts. trump, no longer worried about standing before voters, may feel liberated from the immediate political consequences of his actions - but reality has a way of asserting itself in the end.

  Title: Trump steps back from cliff edge of global trade war - BBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-10 00:17:31)
  Content: for days, donald trump and his white house team had insisted they were fully committed to their decision to impose sweeping reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries. they even derided a report on tuesday that said the president was considering a 90-day pause news that triggered a brief stock market surge. but now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality. the reordering of the global economic order is on hold, and trumps promise of a golden age of american manufacturing will have to wait. the white house has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along. weve had more than 75 countries contact us, and i imagine, after today, there will be more, treasury secretary scott bessent told reporters shortly after the announcement. that framing from the white house is not surprising, of course. and it is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market and growing chorus of republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement. so was it a strategic retreat in the face of unexpected resistance, or yet another example of trumps art of the deal negotiating strategy at work? it didnt take long for trumps aides many of the same people who said he would never back down to fan out and celebrate the presidents move. trade adviser peter navarro said trumps tariff situation unfolded exactly the way it should. you clearly failed to see what president trump is doing here, press secretary karoline leavitt told a crowd of gathered reporters. the entire world is calling the united states of america. they were less clear about the details of trumps tariff suspension, announced via a post on his truth social website. did the reprieve in higher tariffs apply to the eu? were mexico and canada, which had avoided the original 10 baseline tariffs, somehow now included? were tariffs targeting specific sectors affected? ultimately, the white house provided some clarity on these questions but for hours us trading partners were left to scrutinise trumps truth social post and glean details from answers to questions shouted by reporters at press gaggles. on wednesday afternoon, trump acknowledged that the markets had looked pretty glum and that people were getting a little queasy a reflection that undercut some of the bravado he expressed over the past week and could hint at the real reason for his tariff change of course. earlier in the day, he was on truth social, urging people to be cool! and promising that everything is going to work out. and on monday he lashed out at what he called panicans - a party based on weak and stupid people who werent patient with his efforts. in the end, it was trump who made an abrupt change of course. he insisted, however, that his tariff announcement was one that had to be made, and that any economic disruptions reflected a sickness that had been allowed to fester in the american economy. democrats, meanwhile, painted a less rosy picture. senate minority leader chuck schumer accused trump of governing by chaos. he is reeling, he is retreating, and that is a good thing, he said. in the end, the thought process behind trumps decision may not really matter. the reality is that the us is now making nice or at least nicer - with nations that had faced their retaliatory trade fire, even though trump is still imposing a 10 across the board tariff that by itself would have been huge news just a few weeks ago. it is enough of a step down for the stock market to bounce back, however, and trump is now leaning into a trade war with china which he hit with 125 tariffs. that will have global economic repercussions of its own, but it is more in line with recent american foreign policy - including that of democratic president joe biden - as it seeks to constrain chinese ambitions. the big unknown, however, is whether trumps actions over the past week setting allies scrambling and threatening the established global order will have made such a strategy more difficult to pursue. and in 90 days, when trumps pause expires, this weeks economic drama and uncertainty could begin all over again. follow the twists and turns of trumps second term with north america correspondent anthony zurchers weekly us politics unspun newsletter. readers in the uk can sign up here. those outside the uk can sign up here. six people have been confirmed to have died following the crash near to the new jersey side of the hudson. the us government admitted kilmar abrego garcia was deported to el salvador due to administrative error. five of the individuals on board were a family of tourists from spain and the sixth person was the pilot, officials say. news of the us presidents plan to halt higher-band taxes came as a surprise on wednesday, but was it part of a plan?

  Title: Full Episode: Trump announces tariff policy, DeSantis takes on Fine over CD-6 results - Spectrum News 13
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-03 00:30:00)
  Content: president donald trump announces his latest tariff policy, and lawmakers in the florida house advance a proposal to reduce sales taxes in the state. president donald trump ordered the implementation of reciprocal tariffs on nations around the globe wednesday, bucking concerns from members of his own party and volatile markets to levy import taxes on billions of dollars of products that could raise consumer costs for american households by thousands of dollars a year, at least in the short term. trump said at event at the white houses rose garden that the move, which will transform u.s. trade relations with trade partners around the globe, comes on one of the most important days, in my opinion, in american history and is in response to years of the u.s. being looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations, in the presidents words. its our declaration of economic independence. for years, hardworking american citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense, trump said at the event after walking out to a backdrop of numerous american flags. but now its our turn to prosper and in so doing use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and itll all happen very quickly. during his remarks, trump held up a chart showing the reciprocal tariffs would be roughly half of the rate of tariffs he claims other countries levy on u.s. products, including 34 tariffs on imports from china and 20 tariffs on imports from the european union. but the white house has offered few details, and it was unclear where the data on the chart came from. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. the president has promised that factory jobs will return to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk causing a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on cars, clothes and other goods. the new tariffs, on a day trump dubbed liberation day, follow similar recent announcements of 25 taxes on auto imports levies against china, canada and mexico and expanded trade penalties on steel and aluminum. trump has also imposed tariffs on countries that import oil from venezuela and he plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. trump invited brian pannebecker, a retired autoworker who spoke at the republican national convention to speak briefly at his white house news conference on tariffs. my entire life i have watched plant after plant after plant close, pannebecker said. pannebecker, a michigan resident, is the founder of auto workers for trump. the influential union united auto workers endorsed democrat kamala harris in the 2024 election but has backed trumps plans to boost tariffs on imported vehicles. the florida house on wednesday took its first steps toward permanently reducing the states sales tax. the house ways and means committee advanced the bill unanimously, but it still has a long way to go. the florida house still needs to persuade the senate and gov. ron desantis that this is the right path forward. though at the moment, neither is looking too thrilled about the plan. under the bill, floridas 6 sales tax would lower permanently to 5.25. the house estimates that floridians under the bill could save around 5 billion every year. floridas sales tax has sat at 6 since 1988. the bill would also reduce sales tax on a variety of other things like commercial sales tax, electricity, and mobile homes. we are clearly setting a course, and a vision is going to provide immediate, meaningful relief to every single floridian that makes a purchase, state rep. wyman duggan said. i candidly have some concerns with the education budget as it pertains to my school district, but i feel confident will work that out in the budget silo and delivering relief to everyday floridians in a quick and effective way should be our commitment, state rep. anna eskamani said. the house, senate, and the governor all want some sort of tax relief passed this legislative session. the house wants to cut the sales tax, but desantis wants property tax. and the senate stated it is somewhere in between, though some are concerned about any permanent cuts and the potential for a subsequent budget shortfall. gov. ron desantis reacted to the special election results wednesday. specifically, the race in u.s. house district 6. the governor reiterated that he had predicted rep. randy fine would underperform president donald trumps metrics in that district and blamed the candidate himself. i think you have a candidate in randy fine who one, hes a squish, desantis said. he supported restrictions on second amendment rights back in 2018. he tried to defeat my immigration proposal to help president trump enforce immigration laws. and he tried to enact a de facto, make florida a de facto sanctuary state. and so when people see that, our base voters dont get excited about that, youre not giving them a reason to go out and vote. the governor also rejected the idea that the 15-point swing in the district since november was a referendum on trumps agenda. fine fired back at the governor wednesday, writing on social media, a dying star burns hottest before it fades into oblivion. im focused on working with realdonaldtrump to stop democrats from taking this country backwards, not working with them. lets go.

  Title: Trump abruptly fires the 4-star general who headed the National Security Agency
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-04 21:45:36)
  Content: president donald trump, center, arrives on air force one at miami international airport, thursday, april 3, 2025, in miami. ap photorebecca blackwell right-wing activist laura loomer speaks in front of the courthouse where the hush-money trial of donald trump is underway, april 15, 2024, in new york. ap phototed shaffrey, file washington ap president donald trump has abruptly fired the director of the national security agency, according to u.s. officials and members of congress, but the white house and the pentagon have provided no reasons for the move. senior military leaders were informed thursday of the firing of air force gen. tim haugh, who also oversaw the pentagons cyber command, the officials said. they received no advance notice about the decision to remove a four-star general with a 33-year career in intelligence and cyber operations, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel decisions. the move has triggered sharp criticism from members of congress and demands for an immediate explanation. and it marks the latest dismissal of national security officials by trump at a time when his republican administration faces criticism over his failure to take any action against other key leaders use of an unclassified signal messaging chat that included the atlantic editor-in-chief jeffrey goldberg to discuss plans for a military strike. its unclear who now is in charge of the nsa and the cyber command. also fired was haughs civilian deputy at the nsa, wendy noble. the nsa notified congressional leadership and top lawmakers of the national security committees of the firing late wednesday but did not give reasons, according to a person familiar with the situation who insisted on anonymity to discuss the matter. the person said noble has been reassigned to the office of the defense undersecretary for intelligence. the white house did not respond to messages seeking comment. the nsa referred questions about haugh to the defense department. the pentagon did not respond to questions about why he was fired or provide other details. sean parnell, the chief pentagon spokesman, would only say, in a statement, that the department thanks haugh for his decades of service to our nation, culminating as u.s. cyber command commander and national security agency director. we wish him and his family well. far-right activist and commentator laura loomer appeared to take credit friday in a post on x, saying she raised concerns to trump about haughs ties to gen. mark milley and the biden administration and questioned the nsa chiefs loyalty to the president. milley served as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff during trumps first term but has since become an outspoken critic. given the fact that the nsa is arguably the most powerful intel agency in the world, we cannot allow for a biden nominee to hold that position, loomer wrote. thank you president trump for being receptive to the vetting materials provided to you and thank you for firing these biden holdovers. loomer, who has claimed the sept. 11, 2001, attacks were an inside job, had discussed staff loyalty with trump in an oval office meeting wednesday, according to several people familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive personnel manner. a day later, trump said he fired some white house national security council officials. rep. jim himes, ranking member of the house intelligence committee, sent a letter to director of national intelligence tulsi gabbard and defense secretary pete hegseth demanding to know why haugh and noble were fired. public reporting suggests that your removal of these officials was driven by a fringe social media personality, which represents a deeply troubling breach of the norms that safeguard our national security apparatus from political pressure and conspiracy theories, himes, d-conn., wrote. sen. jack reed, a democrat from rhode island, said friday that he has long warned about the dangers of firing military officers as a political loyalty test. in addition to the other military leaders and national security officials trump has fired, he is sending a chilling message throughout the ranks dont give your best military advice, or you may face consequences, reed said in a statement. he added that trump has given a priceless gift to china, russia, iran, and north korea by purging competence from our national security leadership. another democrat, sen. mark warner of virginia, vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee, said the u.s. was facing unprecedented cyber threats and asked how firing haugh, who has served in the military for more than 30 years, makes america safer. haughs firing sets off a 60-day process. unless he is moved to another three- or four-star job in 60 days he would automatically revert to a two-star. any new high-level job would be unlikely since that would require a nomination from trump, who just fired him. as a result, haugh, who was confirmed for the nsa job in a unanimous senate vote in december 2023, would likely retire. trump hasnt commented on haugh or noble, but on thursday he dismissed the national security council firings as normal. always were letting go of people, trump told reporters aboard air force one as he made his way to miami on thursday afternoon. people that we dont like or people that we dont think can do the job or people that may have loyalties to somebody else. the firings come as trumps national security adviser, mike waltz, fights calls for his ouster after using the publicly available encrypted signal app to discuss planning for a sensitive march 15 military operation targeting houthi militants in yemen. warner called it astonishing that trump would fire the nonpartisan, experienced leader of the national security agency while still failing to hold any member of his team accountable for leaking classified information on a commercial messaging app even as he apparently takes staffing direction on national security from a discredited conspiracy theorist in the oval office. haugh met last month with elon musk, whose department of government efficiency has roiled the federal government by slashing personnel and budgets at dozens of agencies. in a statement, the nsa said the meeting was intended to ensure both organizations are aligned with the new administrations priorities. haugh had led both the nsa and cyber command since 2023. both departments play leading roles in the nations cybersecurity. the nsa also supports the military and other national security agencies by collecting and analyzing a vast amount of data and information globally. cyber command is known as americas first line of defense in cyberspace and also plans offensive cyberoperations for potential use against adversaries. associated press writers matthew lee, aamer madhani, zeke miller, david klepper and lou kesten in washington contributed to this report.

  Title: Three ex-presidents denounce current one...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-21 01:16:36)
  Content: barack obama urged americans to resist president donald trumps bullying. joe biden warned that trump is wrecking the sacred promise of social security. bill clinton decried the emphasis on grievances and the need to dominate. in an extraordinary stretch of just over two weeks, three former presidents have taken to the public stage to sound the alarm against the current occupant of the white house, despite the tradition that former presidents generally refrain from publicly criticizing their successors. obama, biden and clinton did not explicitly name trump, but their message was unmistakable. the three democrats said, as much by their presence as their words, that these are unusual times for american democracy, that norms are being disregarded and extraordinary measures are required. the only living president who has not spoken out since inauguration day is republican george w. bush, though he has made little secret of his antipathy for trump. former presidents are uniquely qualified and situated to raise their voices and warn the american people if the country is taking a dangerous turn, said timothy naftali, a historian at columbia universitys school of international and public affairs. think of them as a sort of advisory council to the people of the united states. and when the advisory council sounds the alarm, the people should listen. the ex-presidents made their statements in settings that underlined their points and their alarm. obama spoke on april 3 at hamilton college in upstate new york, one of the countrys oldest colleges, pushing back against trumps pursuit of universities and other institutions and urging those with resources to fight back. it is up to all of us to fix this, obama said. its not going to be because somebody comes and saves you. the most important office in this democracy is the citizen, the ordinary person who says, no, thats not right. biden, speaking in chicago on tuesday at the national conference of advocates, counselors and representatives for the disabled, denounced elon musks cuts to social security, his first public remarks since leaving office. the last thing beneficiaries need from their government is deliberate cruelty, biden said, adding, in fewer than 100 days, this administration has done so much damage and so much devastation. clinton spoke at an emotional ceremony in oklahoma city on saturday morning to commemorate the bombing 30 years ago of the alfred p. murrah federal building, which killed 168 people. clinton compared the way that city has come together with the current national divisions. its like everybody is arguing about whose resentments matter most, whose resentments are more valid, when its okay to stretch the truth a little bit to gain an advantage, clinton said. if our lives are going to be dominated by the effort to dominate the people we disagree with, we are going to put the 250-year march to a more perfect union at risk. clinton praised the service of federal workers at a time when trump is slashing the federal workforce. he also made a case for humility. it does you good every now and then to admit youre wrong, he said. it is unusual for a single president to publicly excoriate his successor, historians say, given the american tradition of seamless transfers of power and the principle that the country has one president at a time. for three to do so in such short order may be unprecedented. what is really significant is this is happening before the end of the first 100 days of the trump presidency, naftali said. ordinarily, former presidents give the current president space to establish himself and learn the rules of the road. but these presidents already see the contours of the changes that president trump wishes to bring. the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the three democratic presidents spoke in terms of fundamental american traditions and values. but their relationship with trump is also marked by personal animosity, as trump has aimed attacks and insults at each of them or their family members. he has repeatedly mocked sleepy joe biden as a senile, elderly figure who has no idea what he is saying much of the time. three months into his second term, trump continues to regularly disparage biden. after biden defeated him in 2020, trump falsely claimed the election was stolen, an assertion he still clings to. he has attacked bidens son hunter as a criminal and drug addict, recently ending secret service protection for hunter and bidens daughter ashley. hunter acknowledges spiraling into addiction after the death of his brother, beau. when obama first ran for president, trump falsely suggested he had not been born in the united states, an assertion seen by many as racist. and he harshly attacked clintons wife, hillary, his opponent in the 2016 election, calling her crooked hillary as his crowds chanted, lock her up! the democratic presidents, in turn, have said trumps violations of legal and democratic principles make him unfit for the presidency. biden in 2022 called trump supporters a threat to our very democracy and said the gop under him had turned toward semi-fascism. he has said he ran for president in 2020 because of trumps support of white supremacists after violence in charlottesville. obama, during the last presidential race, called trump a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems and compared him to former cuban president fidel castro ranting and raving about crazy conspiracy theories. clinton, who left office 24 years ago, mocked trumps age at the democratic national convention in august and again on saturday, noting that he himself is younger. donald trump a paragon of consistency is still dividing, blaming and belittling, clinton said. this sort of rancor is not typical for the men who have held the countrys highest office. while presidents have been at odds before, there is often a sort of camaraderie in the small club of individuals who have borne the weight of the job. after running a bitter race against each other in 1976, jimmy carter and gerald ford developed what carter called mutual respect and intense personal friendship, agreeing that the longest to live would speak at the others funeral. when bush unveiled clintons portrait in 2004, he spoke with affection, saying, the years have done a lot to clarify the strengths of this man. bill clinton loved the job of the presidency. he filled this house with energy and joy. hes a man of enthusiasm and warmth. such sentiments have not been much in evidence in recent years, even as the presidents appeared together at carters funeral and trumps inauguration, both in january. obama, biden and clinton have all seemed struck by the sheer frenzy of the first stretch of trumps second term. at the end of his talk on saturday, clinton stressed that the united states has a wealth of institutions and assets. he asked, are we really going to put them at risk to prove were always right and our resentments are more important than someone elses? this is a modal window.

  Title: How Trump Waged War on His Perceived Foes in First 100 Days
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-22 10:06:09)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article illustrates a Realist perspective on international relations applied domestically. Trump's actions, such as targeting perceived enemies and prioritizing national interests as he defines them, reflect a power-centric approach. The text states, "trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies." This demonstrates a focus on consolidating and exercising power, a core tenet of Realism.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Trump's use of executive orders to target perceived enemies, stating, "trump has made particular use of executive orders...to target perceived foes." This is intriguing because executive orders are typically used to direct policy priorities. Could this suggest a blurring of the lines between policy and personal vendettas, potentially undermining the legitimacy of the executive branch?

  Content: by joseph ax reuters -hours after swearing an oath to defend the u.s. constitution on january 20, president donald trump signed an executive order directing his attorney general to scour the justice department and other agencies for evidence of political weaponization. the same day, pentagon staff took down a portrait of mark milley, a trump critic who as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been the highest-ranking military officer during trumps first term. that evening, trump stripped his former national security adviser, john bolton - who wrote a memoir critical of trump - of the protective secret service detail he had been given after the justice department said iran had threatened boltons life. in his first 100 days, trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies. these include former intelligence officials who investigated alleged russian ties to his 2016 election campaign and major law firms as well as former biden administration members and prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against him while he was out of power. trumps actions served notice that his campaign promise of political retribution was anything but rhetorical, after he repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate. but the speed and sweep of his actions have caught many by surprise, with even the smallest slights drawing reprisals. the republican president has used the machinery of the state and the power of the presidency to go after people and institutions that have aggrieved him in more expansive ways than any of his predecessors, historians said. its not unusual for presidents to have enemies, said jeremi suri, a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin. what is unusual is for the president to use the entirety of the federal government, not simply to exclude someone, but to directly punish them. trump has made particular use of executive orders - typically used by presidents to direct policy priorities - to target perceived foes by stripping them of security clearances, blocking them from government buildings or directing agencies to probe them for wrongdoing. he has launched multiple federal probes into maine after a verbal spat with the states governor, reached deep into the traditionally independent justice department to fire those he views as disloyal, pulled protective security details from his critics and ordered investigations into former officials who challenged his false claims that his 2020 election loss was rigged. on his first day in office, he removed clearances for 50 former national security officials who had signed a letter suggesting russia was behind a story about salacious material found on a laptop belonging to president joe bidens son hunter. no evidence of russian involvement has emerged. he has also taken away clearances for all three democrats who ran against him in presidential contests biden, hillary clinton and kamala harris. trump has focused much of his attention on the criminal justice system after claiming during his 2024 presidential campaign that his four indictments were motivated by politics. then-president joe bidens administration denied the accusations. in trumps first 100 days, his justice department has fired or demoted dozens of officials, prosecutors and fbi agents, including rank-and-file employees who worked on investigations into trump and the january 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob of trump supporters. in a speech at the justice departments headquarters in february, trump denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him with illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. traditional presidencies have failed to bring meaningful change to the ways of washington, and the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy, a white house spokesman, harrison fields, said in response to questions about trumps retribution efforts and whether they represent an abuse of power. utilizing every tool afforded by the constitution, the trump administration is prioritizing efficiency eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and fulfilling every campaign promise. the ferocity and the scope during his first term, trumps instincts for revenge were sometimes thwarted by his own appointees, many of whom were experienced government hands or establishment republicans. by contrast, trump has filled his second-term administration with steadfast loyalists more likely to back his directives than caution against them. meanwhile, the republican majority in congress has shown little interest in opposing his actions. trump has taken steps as well

  Content: crowds of people angry about the way president donald trump is running the country marched and rallied in scores of american cities saturday in the biggest day of demonstrations yet by an opposition movement trying to regain its momentum after the shock of the republicans first weeks in office. so-called hands off! demonstrations were organized for more than 1,200 locations in all 50 states by more than 150 groups, including civil rights organizations, labor unions, lbgtq advocates, veterans and elections activists. the rallies appeared peaceful, with no immediate reports of arrests. pro-palestinian protesters carrying a depiction of president donald trump gather at a rally before marching toward the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ice headquarters, saturday, april 5, 2025, in washington. ap photomanuel balce ceneta thousands of protesters in cities dotting the nation from midtown manhattan to anchorage, alaska, including at multiple state capitols, assailed trump and billionaire elon musk s actions on government downsizing, the economy, immigration and human rights. on the west coast, in the shadow of seattles iconic space needle, protesters held signs with slogans like fight the oligarchy. protesters chanted as they took to the streets in portland, oregon, and los angeles, where they marched from pershing square to city hall. demonstrators voiced anger over the administrations moves to fire thousands of federal workers, close social security administration field offices, effectively shutter entire agencies, deport immigrants, scale back protections for transgender people and cut funding for health programs. musk, a trump adviser who runs tesla, spacex and the social media platform x, has played a key role in the downsizing as the head of the newly created department of government efficiency. he says he is saving taxpayers billions of dollars. asked about the protests, the white house said in a statement that president trumps position is clear he will always protect social security, medicare, and medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. meanwhile, the democrats stance is giving social security, medicaid, and medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush american seniors. kelley robinson, president of the human rights campaign advocacy group, criticized the administrations treatment of the lbgtq community at the rally at the national mall in washington, d.c., where democratic members of congress also took the stage. the attacks that were seeing, theyre not just political. they are personal, yall, robinson said. theyre trying to ban our books, theyre slashing hiv prevention funding, theyre criminalizing our doctors, our teachers, our families and our lives. we dont want this america, yall, robinson added. we want the america we deserve, where dignity, safety and freedom belong not to some of us, but to all of us. in boston, demonstrators brandished signs such as hands off our democracy and hands off our social security. mayor michelle wu said she does not want her children and others to live in a world in which threats and intimidation are government tactics and values like diversity and equality are under attack. activists protest president donald trump, who was a few miles away at his trump national golf club, during a hands off! demonstration saturday, april 5, 2025, in palm beach gardens, fla. ap photoalex brandon protesters carry signs and chant slogans against the policies of president donald trump and elon musk saturday, april 5, 2025, in miami. ap photomarta lavandier i refuse to accept that they could grow up in a world where immigrants like their grandma and grandpa are automatically presumed to be criminals, wu said. roger broom, 66, a retiree from delaware county, ohio, was one of hundreds who rallied at the statehouse in columbus. he said he used to be a reagan republican but has been turned off by trump. hes tearing this country apart, broom said. its just an administration of grievances. hundreds of people also demonstrated in palm beach gardens, florida, a few miles from trumps golf course in jupiter, where he spent the morning at the clubs senior club championship. people lined both sides of pga drive, encouraging cars to honk and chanting slogans against trump. they need to keep their hands off of our social security, said archer moran of port st. lucie, florida. activists protest president donald trump, who was a few miles away at his trump national golf club, during a hands off!

  Title: 100 DAYS OF PUNISHING FOES...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article demonstrates how Trump actively shapes the public's perception by prioritizing certain narratives (e.g., 'political weaponization,' 'lies and abuses') and repeatedly emphasizing them. The text states Trump 'repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate' and 'denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him.' This constant reinforcement influences which issues voters deem important, potentially overshadowing other concerns.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the speed and scope of Trump's actions, noting that 'even the smallest slights drawing reprisals.' This suggests a potential underlying mechanism of personal vendettas driving policy decisions, raising questions about the stability and predictability of the administration's actions. What are the long-term consequences of such personalized governance?; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work.' This raises questions about the ethical implications of such arrangements and whether they constitute a form of extortion or coercion. Does this set a dangerous precedent for future interactions between the government and private entities?

  Content: reuters -hours after swearing an oath to defend the u.s. constitution on january 20, president donald trump signed an executive order directing his attorney general to scour the justice department and other agencies for evidence of political weaponization. the same day, pentagon staff took down a portrait of mark milley, a trump critic who as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been the highest-ranking military officer during trumps first term. that evening, trump stripped his former national security adviser, john bolton - who wrote a memoir critical of trump - of the protective secret service detail he had been given after the justice department said iran had threatened boltons life. in his first 100 days, trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies. these include former intelligence officials who investigated alleged russian ties to his 2016 election campaign and major law firms as well as former biden administration members and prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against him while he was out of power. trumps actions served notice that his campaign promise of political retribution was anything but rhetorical, after he repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate. but the speed and sweep of his actions have caught many by surprise, with even the smallest slights drawing reprisals. the republican president has used the machinery of the state and the power of the presidency to go after people and institutions that have aggrieved him in more expansive ways than any of his predecessors, historians said. its not unusual for presidents to have enemies, said jeremi suri, a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin. what is unusual is for the president to use the entirety of the federal government, not simply to exclude someone, but to directly punish them. trump has made particular use of executive orders - typically used by presidents to direct policy priorities - to target perceived foes by stripping them of security clearances, blocking them from government buildings or directing agencies to probe them for wrongdoing. he has launched multiple federal probes into maine after a verbal spat with the states governor, reached deep into the traditionally independent justice department to fire those he views as disloyal, pulled protective security details from his critics and ordered investigations into former officials who challenged his false claims that his 2020 election loss was rigged. on his first day in office, he removed clearances for 50 former national security officials who had signed a letter suggesting russia was behind a story about salacious material found on a laptop belonging to president joe bidens son hunter. no evidence of russian involvement has emerged. he has also taken away clearances for all three democrats who ran against him in presidential contests biden, hillary clinton and kamala harris. trump has focused much of his attention on the criminal justice system after claiming during his 2024 presidential campaign that his four indictments were motivated by politics. then-president joe bidens administration denied the accusations. in trumps first 100 days, his justice department has fired or demoted dozens of officials, prosecutors and fbi agents, including rank-and-file employees who worked on investigations into trump and the january 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob of trump supporters. in a speech at the justice departments headquarters in february, trump denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him with illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. traditional presidencies have failed to bring meaningful change to the ways of washington, and the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy, a white house spokesman, harrison fields, said in response to questions about trumps retribution efforts and whether they represent an abuse of power. utilizing every tool afforded by the constitution, the trump administration is prioritizing efficiency eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and fulfilling every campaign promise. the ferocity and the scope during his first term, trumps instincts for revenge were sometimes thwarted by his own appointees, many of whom were experienced government hands or establishment republicans. by contrast, trump has filled his second-term administration with steadfast loyalists more likely to back his directives than caution against them. meanwhile, the republican majority in congress has shown little interest in opposing his actions. trump has taken steps as well to eliminate internal watchdogs who might seek to constrain him, purging inspectors general and firing government ethics officials. all administrations, particularly when you see a switch from one party to another, seek to control the executive branch, said historian timothy naftali, the former director of the richard nixon presidential library and museum. its the ferocity and the scope of what hes done that makes it unprecedented. the republican nixon famously had a list of enemies, but he plotted against them in secret. his most aggressive ideas, such as using the tax-collecting internal revenue service to audit his foes, were often blocked by his own officials. other presidents have used their power to penalize rivals in more muted ways, suri said. democrat lyndon johnson sought to discredit his political rival, robert kennedy, in the news media, and republican george w. bush banned brent scowcroft, a former national security adviser, from the white house after scowcroft wrote a column opposing the iraq war. thats often how presidents use their power to go after enemies they keep them out of their administration and spread rumors about them, suri said. trump has frequently

  Title: Mass protests across the U.S. signal opposition to Trump, Musk
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-05 18:04:46)
  Content: tens of thousands of people crowded in front of the washington monument and in cities across the nation on saturday to protest president donald trump and top adviser elon musks dismantling of federal agencies, imposition of sweeping tariffs and what demonstrators called the circumvention of due process. organizers said at least 1,300 hands off rallies were planned by more than 150 groups in all 50 states. photos and videos on social media showed throngs gathered in public squares or marching through the streets from boston to los angeles. rallygoers dressed in statue of liberty costumes, waved anti-trump flags and had their canines wear dogs against doge collars. in the freezing rain in providence, rhode island, they carried signs decrying the administrations deportation efforts. under sunny skies in atlanta, home to the centers for disease control and prevention, they blasted the defunding of public health. and on a beach in san francisco, they formed a human banner to send a message to the president hands off democracy! protesters rallied across the u.s on april 5 in what organizers say is the largest single-day demonstrations against president trump and elon musk. video the washington post in washington, the crowd swelled as far as the eye could see from all sides of the stage on the national mall. no moral person wants an economy-crashing dictator who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing, rep. jamie raskin d-maryland declared, laying into the trump administration for the stock market downturn, attacks on law firms and close relations with international dictators. organizers said they hoped saturdays events would be the largest trump protests since he returned to office in january. in their permit application to the national park service, rally organizers in d.c. said they anticipated a crowd of 10,000. by friday night, though, the organizers said they expected at least 20,000. saturday afternoon, they were estimating the crowd was five times as big as they predicted. the white house postponed spring garden tours scheduled for saturday because of the potential size of the event. police began closing streets around the national mall on saturday afternoon as the crowd swelled beyond the figures predicted by organizers. political protesting was a new experience for jac behrends, a 28-year-old livestock farmer from new yorks hudson valley. she drove down at 430 a.m. to be there. shes never been particularly political, but seeing musk mimic a nazi salute and seeing trumps rhetoric sway her mom into fearing immigrants spurred her to action, she said. i wanted to be at the heart of it, and d.c. is definitely the heart of it, behrends said. i really hate that billionaires and the rich are in control of our political system. that is not what this country was founded on. people gathered in response to what they see as the administrations overreach on a variety of issues nato schools libraries courts veteran services fair elections and, organizers said, our jobs, our wallets, our bodies. britt jacovich, a spokesperson for the liberal group moveon.org, which was one of the organizers, said people not only want trump to get his hands off abortion rights and civil rights issues, they want his hands off social security, medicare, medicaid, the federal workforce, the value of their 401k, the broader u.s. economy, and much more. jacovich said the breadth of the groups organizing reflects the growing opposition to trump, musk and the republican party in washington. she recalls how shes in group chats with friends and family in which everyone was watching their 401ks plummet in real time. if youre worried about donald trump or elon musk or the republican party, this rally is for you, she said. during trumps first term, protests tended to concentrate in washington but organizers want to spread the rallies out around the country, jacovich said. many of smaller rallies are forming organically among neighbors and friends, she said, reaching people who may not have protested last time he was president. we are rallying to demand an end to trumps craven power grab and his acting like the law does not apply to him, said rachel oleary carmona, executive director of womens march, a group that is helping organize the rallies. carmona said she is seeing a broader array of people who want to rally against trump. the rallies that womens march has organized, she said, have focused more on abortion rights and womens issues. the rallies on saturday were more wide-ranging in scope. its hard to get narrow in opposition when his attacks are so broad, carmona said. she said that core progressive groups are growing. womens march, she said, has added 600,000 members just this year. howard bass, 77, a retired smithsonian institution employee, arrived at the rally saturday from arlington, virginia, with a sign listing 11 hands off subjects. among them the smithsonian, academic freedom, greenland, free speech and social security. bass is no stranger to protests. i was out in the streets when nixon was president, bass said. when he heard about the rally, bass said, he decided to come in two seconds, maybe less. bass, a musician who plays the lute and guitar, said about half his income comes from social security. he also draws a pension from his smithsonian employment. he said hes concerned about the future of both. and he worries about his friends still at the smithsonian i know theyre under a lot of pressure, bass said. bass described his central emotion of these days as fear. and he compared his protests against nixon with those against trump. it many ways it was a simpler time, he said of the nixon days. there was one big target vietnam. now there are hundreds of targets to protest against. janice benton, 68, and martin benton, 77, took metro trains from their home in college park, maryland, and headed to the rally in d.c. janice on foot, martin on his mobility scooter. he was born with cerebral palsy and in recent years has developed stenosis of the spine. we cant give up, said martin, wearing a t-shirt that read make orwell fiction again. on the front of the scooter was this sign denying history is anti-american ideology. on the back resist. janice held a sign reading chose empathy not vindictive revenge. people are dying and suffering. martin, a native of monticello, georgia, spent his career a federal employee. he worked at the irs, the library of congress and, lastly, 22 years at the department of education, where he monitored and audited grants used for special education. he worries that cuts or abolishment of the education department will diminish funding and attention to children with disabilities. he was doing what musk is supposed to be doing, janice quipped about her husband of 44 years. shed spent her career in disability advocacy and ministry. janice said she had plans to spend saturday with deaf friends at a retreat an important event that she said gave way to the importance of supporting the hands-off message. she and martin worry about how many people could be affected by cuts to social security, medicare and medicaid. a graduate of the university of georgia law school, and wearing a masters golf cap, martin also worries about law firms giving in to the trump administrations demands. in a speech on thursday, former president barack obama urged law firms, universities and people across the country to stand up for democratic values and resist trump. it is up to all of us to fix this, he said, including the citizen, the ordinary person who says, no, thats not right.

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
