  Title: Karen Read's second murder trial revives debate over who killed her Boston police officer boyfriend
  Source: abcnews.go.com (2025-04-22 00:14:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article highlights the prosecution's focus on 'drinking, driving, deadly consequences,' echoing a common public safety narrative. This suggests an attempt to frame the case in a way that resonates with pre-existing public concerns, potentially influencing jury perception and minimizing focus on the defense's conspiracy claims.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the defense was prevented from implicating Colin Albert in their opening statements. This is intriguing because it suggests a limitation on the defense's ability to present their full case. What is the justification for this limitation, and how might it impact the jury's perception of the defense's claims?

  Title: Reams of documents related to L.A. County sex abuse cases never turned over, lawyers say
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:11:23)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article illustrates aspects of the Principal-Agent Problem within the context of public institutions. The county (the principal, representing the public interest) delegates authority to its probation staff (the agents). The text highlights alleged failures of the agents (abuse) and a potential failure of the principal (the county) to adequately oversee, document, and respond to these actions over decades, as evidenced by the discovery dispute and the large settlement payout. This suggests a breakdown in the mechanisms designed to ensure agents act in the best interest of the principal and those they serve.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative around AB 218 and subsequent legislative proposals (like SB 577) reflects elements of Agenda-Setting Theory. The large volume of lawsuits enabled by AB 218 (an event/policy) has forced the issue of institutional liability and financial burden onto the legislative agenda, prompting lawmakers to propose new bills aimed at managing the fallout. The framing by Senator Laird about 'restoring equilibrium' suggests an attempt to shape the public and legislative perception of the problem and the proposed solution.

  Content: thousands of documents that could contain key details about rampant childhood sexual abuse inside a defunct santa clarita detention camp including so-called grooming drawings were left scattered inside the facility and never turned over to the victims attorneys, according to a firm suing l.a. county over the decades-old incidents. as part of the preparation for a looming june trial, attorneys with law firm manly, stewart finaldi had arranged april 15 to visit camp scott, a shuttered l.a. county probation camp where many of their clients say they were sexually abused as children. inside the facility were reams of records that the county should have turned over to the firm more than a year ago through discovery, said attorney courtney thom, whose firm has about 150 civil cases alleging sexual abuse by county probation staff. you can understand my shock when im walking through where my clients got raped as children, and there are documents everywhere, thom said at a monday superior court hearing in downtown los angeles. thom said she discovered thousands of paper grievances, a locked file cabinet labeled personnel files camps a w, and a drawing she believed was signed by thomas jackson a probation deputy accused by at least 20 women of sexually assaulting them at the camp. the drawing, included in a court filing, was of the name tami in big, block orange letters and appeared to be signed by a jackson. t. attorney james sargent, who is representing the county and accompanied thom for the tour last week, called her claims inflammatory and incorrect. they want to air what they deem as dirty laundry, said sargent, who told l.a. superior court judge lawrence riff that the personnel files they discovered had nothing to do with the staff named in the lawsuits. nor did the drawing, he said. tami wilson, a former supervisor at the camp, told him she recalled being given the hand-drawn card by a youth, he wrote in a court filing. the county announced earlier this month they planned to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of alleged sexual abuse inside the countys juvenile facilities and foster homes. the settlement believed to be the largest sex abuse settlement in u.s. history arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to file civil suits against alleged predators and the agencies that employed them. a handful of prominent firms including manly, stewart finaldi declined to participate in the settlement and have ongoing litigation. in the aftermath of ab 218, state legislators have introduced several bills to attempt to make it easier for governments and school districts to deal with the financial fallout from the deluge of suits. one of these bills sb 577 is set for a hearing tuesday. the bills author, state sen. john laird, said the legislation is intended to restore some equilibrium, lessening the financial blow to public agencies while still upholding a victims right to sue. county lawyers claim one reason the state law change has had such a devastating financial toll is because many of the records they need to fight decades-old cases are long gone. attorney john manly argued the claim flew in the face of what his firm saw at camp scott. the county has been telling all of sacramento that they dont have any documents, said manly, who urged the judge to allow his firm to publicize the footage theyd taken of the heaps of documents. we need to be able to share this with legislators. riff agreed with the countys request that the videos from inside camp scott remain confidential for now due to security risks, though he instructed both sides to try to find some common ground on whether certain videos could be made public. though camp scott hasnt been used to house youths for years, sargent wrote in a filing that may soon change. l.a. county superior court judge miguel espinoza ordered the county friday to prepare to shut down los padrinos juvenile hall the countys last remaining juvenile hall, where roughly 270 youths are held due to problems stemming from chronic understaffing. the youth presently in los padrinos will need to go somewhere, and if some wind up at camp scott, the public release of photos and videos could be seriously detrimental, sargent wrote. thom noted that both reporters and television crews have been allowed to broadcast footage taken inside the camp, including a 2001 documentary, camp scott lock-up. the l.a. times has been in there to photograph, said thom. mtv videoed more than we did.

  Title: Is Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated (CORT) Among the Best Guru Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts?
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-23 17:17:07)
  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. we recently published a list of 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. in this article, we are going to take a look at where corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort stands against other guru stocks to invest in. wall street seems to be breathing a little easier after the initial panic over president trumps tariffs earlier this month, but the rollercoaster is not over just yet. all three major indexes closed last week in the red, with the dow and nasdaq both dipping over 2, and the broader market down more than 1. even though markets remain closed on april 18 for good friday, the general consensus is that the worst of the trade war headlines might be dying down. marko papic, chief strategist of geomacro strategy at bca research, remains cautiously optimistic, noting that while the idea of president trump striking 90 trade deals in 90 days sounds ambitious, they will likely be small, symbolic wins that still help calm markets. that said, volatility is expected to continue, and papic predicts the broader market could dip again before bouncing back, potentially giving investors a buying opportunity. investors are deep in earnings season right now, and some of wall streets biggest banks have reported solid first-quarter results. a big part of their success came from their trading desks, which cashed in on the recent market volatility, especially in equities. however, despite strong numbers on paper, bank ceos remain cautious and are hesitant to make big moves right now because of the market uncertainty. the us dollar also just had its worst weekly performance since 2022. meanwhile, investors are playing it safe and rapidly buying bonds, which pushed the 10-year treasury yield down to around 4.28. while some investors are seeing the current market dip as a buying opportunity, daniel von ahlen from globaldata ts lombard says otherwise. he believes the risks of a recession are being seriously underestimated. even though trumps recent tariff halt gave markets a bit of a boost, ahlen thinks that bounce will not last. in his view, this is not the time to scoop up stocks on the cheap, he is actually advising people to sell into rallies and avoid the usual buy-the-dip strategy. ahlen suggests getting a bit more cautious and selective. instead of jumping into the whole market, he recommends focusing on defensive sectors, like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare, that tend to hold up better in downturns. the market uncertainty is reflected in etfs as well, which are often considered wiser investment options due to active management strategies and lower risk compared to individual investing. for example, the guru etf is down 8.30 year-to-date as of april 18. however, over the last 12 months, the fund has posted share price returns of 13.38. similarly, five-year share returns stand at an impressive 51.57. guru gives retail investors a way to tap into the top stock picks of major hedge funds at a relatively low 0.75 expense ratio. it offers a more affordable and flexible way to try and beat the broader market using expert insights. so, lets take a look at the best guru stocks to buy. a biologist in a lab coat studying a culture of cells to find a cure for metabolic disorders. for this article, we looked up the guru etf, which had 82 holdings as of april 18. next, we manually searched for the average upside potential of each stock and selected 11 stocks with the highest values. the list below is ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of april 18. we have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment as of q4 2024. why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

  Title: Coca-Cola under fire after bombshell report exposes ties to controversial industry: 'The cost is irreversible damage to our children's health'
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-22 11:30:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying the concept of Externalities, the article highlights how the social costs of fracking and plastic production (environmental damage, health issues) are not fully borne by the companies involved (Coca-Cola, Unilever, etc.). The text states, 'the fracking process creates environmental damage and can significantly impact local communities' and mentions 'irreversible damage to our childrens health'. This suggests a market failure where the price of plastic does not reflect its true cost to society, leading to overproduction and consumption.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Coca-Cola's 'World Without Waste' initiative but then states 'its link to fracking operations suggests it is still looking to create new plastics.' This juxtaposition creates a contradiction. What are the specific mechanisms preventing Coca-Cola from fully transitioning to recycled plastics, and could these mechanisms be related to the profitability of fracking-derived plastics?

  Title: Karen Read is back on trial for murder. Here’s what to know.
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-01 10:00:00)
  Content: a bitterly contested murder case is returning to court in massachusetts, reigniting a legal battle that has captivated true crime enthusiasts and placed a small-town police force under a microscope. karen read, 45, is set to stand trial again on charges that she struck and killed her boyfriend, boston police officer john okeefe, with her suv after a night of drinking on jan. 29, 2022. her first trial ended in a deadlocked jury last summer. the retrial is set to begin april 1 with jury selection. what happened the night of okeefes death? okeefe and read, a former equity analyst and adjunct professor at bentley college, had been drinking at various bars on the night of jan. 28, 2022, according to court records. just after midnight, read dropped off okeefe at a party in the canton, massachusetts, home of brian albert, another boston police officer. okeefe, 46, was found unresponsive outside alberts house by read at about 6 a.m. jan. 29 and later pronounced dead at a hospital. an autopsy determined he had died of a combination of hypothermia and blunt force trauma. prosecutors alleged that read, his girlfriend of two years, struck him with her suv while turning around after dropping him off. during the trial, they pointed to first responders called to the scene who claimed they heard her yell, i hit him. i hit him. oh my god. i hit him, as well as angry messages she allegedly sent okeefe before his death and vehicle data from the suv. the defense argued that okeefe was assaulted during a party inside alberts house and was left outside in a snowstorm with his injuries staged to suggest he was struck by a car. they said authorities failed to search the house for evidence of a struggle and highlighted potential conflicts of interest between investigators and other members and associates of law enforcement who were at the party that night. prosecutors rejected their claims. what happened during the first trial? read was charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating under the influence of alcohol, and leaving the scene of personal injury and death. more than 70 witnesses testified during the nine-week trial and jurors sifted through more than 600 pieces of evidence only to remain deadlocked, leading judge beverly cannone to declare a mistrial on july 1. two expert witnesses, brought in by the u.s. department of justice to review law enforcements handling of the case, testified that okeefes injuries and the physical evidence did not align with the prosecutions theory that reads suv struck him. the lead investigator, massachusetts state police trooper michael proctor, admitted on the witness stand to sending texts in which he mocked reads health condition, used crude insults to describe her and joked with colleagues about searching her phone for nude photos. in one message, he wrote that he wished she would kill herself. proctor said his comments had zero impact on the investigation. after the mistrial, massachusetts state police removed him from the detective unit. on march 19, the massachusetts state police trial board voted to dishonorably discharge proctor. he was found guilty of three charges of unsatisfactory performance and one charge of consuming alcohol while on duty. the family of okeefe filed a wrongful-death lawsuit last august against karen read as well as two canton bars the couple visited the night he died. a judge ordered a stay in the case to allow reads second criminal trial to proceed. what is expected to happen at the retrial? the theories put forward by the prosecution and defense dont normally change much after a mistrial but strategies do, according to michael cassidy, a criminal law professor at boston college law school and a former state and local prosecutor in massachusetts. cassidy said he expects prosecutors to pare down their case and call fewer witnesses. the defense will probably try to signal as strongly as possible to jurors that there was a previous trial jurors are not told they are at a retrial. the jurys awareness theres a retrial can help the defense, cassidy said they might think, someone else had reasonable doubt about this case, why shouldnt i? prosecutors might leverage the extensive media participation by read and other witnesses to their advantage, which gives prosecutors a broader pool of statements to draw from in an effort to catch inconsistencies in a sworn testimony. the more time a defendant talks to the media, that gives the prosecutors more instances to trip her up, cassidy said. cassidy said jury makeup will be a key change to watch. he suggested the defense will pursue younger jurors or those more open to ideas about conspiracies or government corruption, while prosecutors might want older, more conservative jurors who disapprove of reads alleged heavy drinking and fighting with her partner. how has the case captivated the public? true-crime fans, conspiracy theorists and cable news watchers were drawn to the case, thanks to the swirling narratives of a telegenic female murder suspect, a rocky romance and an alleged cover-up. the first trial was marked by dueling groups of demonstrators outside the courthouse. supporters of read gathered in pink shirts and held signs reading free karen read. groups of detractors held justice for john placards and chanted i hit him! i hit him! in reference to what read allegedly said after finding okeefes body.

  Title: Karen Read’s second murder trial revives debate over who killed her Boston police officer boyfriend
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-22 16:36:55)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights the prosecution's focus on 'drinking, driving, deadly consequences,' which, as Michael Coyne states, has been 'drilled into us since middle school.' This suggests an attempt to leverage pre-existing societal narratives to frame the case in a way that resonates with jurors and influences public perception.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the defense is hampered by a pretrial ruling preventing them from implicating Colin Albert in their opening statements. This is intriguing because it suggests a potential bias or constraint on the defense's ability to present a full picture of the events. What other evidence might the defense be prevented from presenting, and how might this affect the jury's perception of the case?

  Content: dedham, mass. ap the second murder trial of karen read, whose case has sparked a national debate on police accountability and won her legions of devoted fans, began with opening statements tuesday, more than three years after the death of her boston police officer boyfriend. read is accused of striking her boyfriend, john okeefe, with her suv in 2022 and leaving him to die alone in the snow outside of a house party in canton, a suburb about 20 miles 32 kilometers south of boston. she has been charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating a vehicle under the influence and leaving the scene. during the first trial last year, prosecutors said read intentionally backed into okeefe after she dropped him off at a house party and returned hours later to find him dead. the defense said that she was a victim of a vast police conspiracy and that okeefe was fatally beaten by another law enforcement officer at the party. a mistrial was declared last year after jurors said they were at an impasse and deliberating further would be futile. the biggest difference in the current trial is the lead prosecutor, hank brennan. brought in as a special prosecutor after the mistrial, the former defense attorney has represented a number of prominent clients, including notorious boston gangster james whitey bulger. brennan began his opening statement tuesday by describing the firefighter who raced to the scene in near-blizzard conditions and found read and two other women surrounding okeefes body on the ground. he stepped out into bedlam, he said. the firefighter then asked read what had happened, he said. youll hear her words, i hit him. i hit him. i hit him, brennan said. she admitted what she had done that night. brennan told jurors that facts and data will lead them to the truth, and that reads own statements will confirm it. but defense attorney alan jackson began his opening statement by saying the prosecutions case was based on a brazen and flawed assertion that is untethered to the facts and the evidence. john okeefe did not die from being hit by a vehicle, he said. the facts will show that. the evidence will show that. the data will show that. the science will show that and the experts will tell you that. many of the factors that made the first trial must-see television will feature in the second. most of the the same witnesses are back as are reads aggressive defense team and dozens of her supporters camped out near the courthouse many carrying free karen read signs and wearing pink. read, who has been featured in several documentaries about her case, has become a minor celebrity. a few dozen of reads supporters, many holding american flags, stood in front of the courthouse tuesday morning before moving a block away to comply with a court-ordered buffer zone. those who were reuniting hugged each other, while others took time to bring newcomers up to speed on the case. im here for justice, said ashlyn wade, a read supporter from canton. the murderer going to jail and karen being exonerated, that would be justice. the prosecution, however, stands to benefit from a pretrial ruling from judge beverly cannone that defense attorneys cant mention potential third-party culprits in their opening statements. they can develop a case against two law enforcement officers but cannot implicate alberts nephew, colin albert, as they did in the first trial. i view it as a blow to the defense strategy but not a knockout punch, daniel medwed, a law professor at northeastern university, said of the ruling. all the defense needs to do is create reasonable doubt about karen reads guilt, and that doesnt require pointing to an alternative perpetrator as a matter of law. legal experts expect prosecutors to focus on reads behavior as they did during the first trial her volatile relationship with okeefe and their night of heavy drinking. they also predict the prosecution will lay out a stronger and more coherent case that read clipped okeefe with the back of her suv and sent him tumbling to the ground using data from her car, video and stronger expert testimony. the commonwealth will focus on the theme drilled into us since middle school drinking, driving, deadly consequences, michael coyne, the dean of massachusetts school of law at andover, said in an email. the defense is expected to offer evidence that what they see as a sloppy police investigation was biased and that law enforcement officers set read up to protect the real killers. they could be helped by an audit of the canton police department released last month that found several mistakes with the investigation but no evidence of a cover-up. one of the key witnesses will be former state trooper michael proctor. he led the investigation but has since been fired after a disciplinary board found that he sent sexist and crude texts about read to his family and colleagues. michael proctor and his dismissal from the force may very well serve as the elephant in the courtroom throughout the proceedings, medwed said.

  Title: Karen Read heads to trial for the second time for allegedly murdering Boston cop boyfriend
  Source: nypost.com (2025-04-22 07:00:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article focuses heavily on the retrial and the prosecution's narrative, potentially influencing public perception. "Prosecutors claim that read mowed down okeefe...with her lexus suv...and then left him to die in a snowbank." This repeated framing could shape the audience's view of Read's guilt or innocence before all evidence is presented.; Theories_and_interpretations: Realism, typically applied to international relations, can be adapted to understand the power dynamics within the legal system. The mention of "a sprawling law enforcement cover-up" and the limitations placed on the defense's ability to present alternate suspects suggest a struggle for power and control over the narrative. The state, represented by the prosecution, seeks to maintain its authority and legitimacy.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that Read's case has garnered a "cult-like following" due to the defense theory and the livestreamed trial. However, it doesn't explore the reasons *why* this case has resonated so strongly with the public. What specific aspects of the case have captured the public's imagination, and what does this say about broader societal anxieties or beliefs?; Intriguing_angles: The article notes that the judge placed "new limitations on how far the defense could go in raising brian albert and higgins as alleged alternate suspects." This restriction seems significant, especially given the defense's claim of a law enforcement cover-up. What specific evidence was deemed insufficient, and what criteria were used to make that determination? Could these limitations potentially hinder the defense's ability to present a complete picture of the events?

  Title: LA County reaches tentative $4 billion settlement involving more than 6,800 claims of childhood sexual abuse - ABC7 Los Angeles
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-04 17:19:36)
  Content: los angeles kabc - los angeles county has tentatively reached a 4 billion agreement to settle more than 6,800 childhood sexual abuse claims dating back to 1959 and allegedly perpetrated in juvenile facilities or foster care, officials said friday. on behalf of the county, i apologize wholeheartedly to everyone who was harmed by these reprehensible acts, the countys chief executive officer fesia davenport said in a statement. the historic scope of this settlement makes clear that we are committed to helping the survivors recover and rebuild their lives-and to making and enforcing the systemic changes needed to keep young people safe. the settlement now must be approved by the l.a. county claims board and the board of supervisors. in a written statement to eyewitness news, the l.a. county board of supervisors said in part we hope that this settlement, once approved, can bring some measure of healing to those who experienced abuse and help them in rebuilding their lives. as a board, we are committed to holding county departments accountable for safeguarding the young people we serve, ensuring that reforms are enforced, and working with law enforcement to bring perpetrators to justice. the majority of the claims date from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s and are alleged to have happened at probation department facilities and at the maclaren childrens center, which was permanently closed in 2003, according to a news release. investigations are ongoing, and two cases have been referred to the district attorneys office for possible prosecution. this marks the costliest financial settlement in the countys history and will have a significant impact on the countys budget for years to come, the news release said, adding that the countys plan to pay for the settlement includes cash from reserve funds, issuance of judgment obligation bonds and proposed cuts in departmental budgets. the proposed settlement is scheduled to go before the claims board on april 7. if approved, it will be considered by the board of supervisors on april 29. attorney patrick mcnicholas helped negotiate the multi-billion-dollar settlement. each individual person who is going to receive settlement money has their own individual case, and each case will be presented in the settlement process individually based upon that persons facts and circumstances, the injuries and damages they sustained, mcnicholas said. in interviews with abc news last april, attorneys for some of the victims said the abuse was common among juvenile detainees who did time throughout facilities in l.a. county for more than three decades. as a teenager in the early 2000s, reanell hartley was locked up inside the fences of camp scott, a juvenile facility run by the los angeles probation department in santa clarita. hartley said she had a rough childhood, a victim of sexual abuse who was forced into prostitution when she was just 11. she had hoped camp scott would help to get her life back on track. i was excited because i was told that i was going to find discipline, i was going to find rehabilitation within the juvenile probation system, hartley told abc news. the things that i found here was a total opposite. hartley alleged in a lawsuit that at camp scott she was repeatedly sexually abused by a probation officer. camp scott is now closed, but when it opened as a girls-only juvenile facility in 1987, it was touted as a model boot camp style facility, designed to scare young women straight. detainees were told when they could eat, talk, and even when they could go to the bathroom. they showered in groups and were punished with solitary confinement. but l.a. countys juvenile halls and camps came under scrutiny following reports of abuse and unsafe conditions, including by the u.s. department of justice in 2007 which forced l.a. county probation into federal oversight for six years. these cookies are necessary for our services to function and

  Content: this is an edition of the atlantic daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. sign up for it here. late last month, jonathan braun was arrested on allegations of shoving a 3-year-old, causing a red mark on his back and substantial pain. this is only his latest brush with the law over the past four years. he was banned by federal and new york state judges from working in debt collection fined 20 million and accused of punching his wife and father-in-law, groping a nanny, and attacking a nurse with an iv-bag holder. he also allegedly threatened a man at his synagogue who asked him to pipe down during services. this crime spree is stunning, but what makes it national news is that it has all happened since 2021, when president donald trump commuted brauns 10-year prison sentence for smuggling marijuana. braun, granted clemency during the last hours of trumps first term as president, is one of many recipients of a trump pardon who has found himself back in trouble with the law. some of them are people convicted of serious offenses on january 6, 2021, and then pardoned at the outset of trumps second term in office. despite trumps depiction of the rioters as peace-loving patriots, more than a few of them have proved to be repeat offenders. braun, who is now back in prison , is not the only first-term recipient of clemency to be rearrested. eli weinstein, a convicted ponzi schemer who received a last-minute 2021 commutation, was convicted on march 31 in a 41 million fraud case. philip esformes, whose sentence for his role in a 1.3 billion medicare fraud was commuted in 2020, was arrested last year on domestic-violence-related charges, but the state dropped them a month later. the rapper kodak black has also been repeatedly arrested since receiving a commutation. but the group of people convicted in connection with january 6 has been particularly likely to have found more trouble. former proud boys leader enrique tarrio, who was sentenced to 22 years for seditious conspiracy and other crimes, was arrested for assault just a month after being pardonedat the capitol, no less. d.c. prosecutors declined to pursue charges. he also tried unsuccessfully to stir up conflict at a conference of trump critics in february. matthew huttle, an indiana man who received a pardon for entering the capitol on january 6, was fatally shot by a deputy on january 27 after reaching for a gun. emily hernandez, a missouri woman, was convicted for causing a fatal drunk-driving crash in 2022 the sentencing came days after her pardon for january 6 offenses. andrew taake of texas was pardoned in january, then arrested in february on an outstanding charge for allegedly sending explicit messages to an undercover cop he believed was an underage girl. its not just that clemency recipients have been accused of crimes since their pardons theyve also tried to use the pardons to get off for other offenses. edward kelley argued that his pardon from trump for january 6 also covered his plot to kill the fbi agents who investigated him a judge disagreed. daniel ball said that charges of illegally possessing a gun should be thrown out because the weapon was discovered in a search related to now-pardoned january 6 charges, and the acting u.s. attorney agreed , but dan wilson, a pardoned capitol rioter who made a similar argument, had less luck with a federal appeals court. other defendants have made similar claims, with varying results . david daniel, who was charged with producing and possessing child pornography, also argued that a search that turned up the material was invalid because of his january 6 pardon, but the u.s. attorney in the case disagreed . daniel has pleaded not guilty to the charges. seeing so many people who received pardons get back in trouble with the law should be deeply embarrassing for trumpthough to be fair, pardoning people for a violent assault on the capitol should have been embarrassing to him as well. he is not the first president to issue clemency for personal reasons, but presidential administrations usually carefully administer commutations and pardons, in part to avoid recidivism. the trump white house, however, has shown little regard for the process. last month, it fired justice department pardon attorney elizabeth oyer after she opposed restoring gun rights for the actor mel gibson, then tried to block her from testifying to congress. trump, the first convicted felon to serve as president, has long claimed that he will restore law and order in america, but his definition is highly selective. some of the presidents commutations and pardons are simply favors granted to people who are well connected, but in the case of the january 6 commutations, he was eager to reward loyalty and to make a political point that he and they had both been subjects of political persecution. this creates a nauseating contrast with statements this week in which administration officials have claimed that kilmar abrego garcia, a maryland resident living under protected legal status who was deported to el salvador, is a terrorist, despite a total lack of evidence and despite the fact that the government has previously acknowledged his deportation was an administrative error . the search for some offense to pin on abrego garcia is also being done to make a political point. if trump is eager to find dangerous criminals, he could do so more easily by looking at his pardon list. related here are four new stories from the atlantic todays news 1. a federal judge found probable cause to hold the trump administration in contempt over its willful disregard of his order temporarily blocking the deportations the administration has justified under a wartime law. 2. the justice department is suing maine for allowing trans students to play in girls and womens

  Title: Conservative Group Tries to Stop in Court...
  Source: www.vox.com (2025-04-04 20:58:36)
  Content: at least some gop legal elites are lining up against trumps trade policy. that could be enough to sway the justices. on thursday, one day after president donald trump announced sweeping new tariffs, what appears to be the first lawsuit challenging those tariffs was filed in a federal court in florida. that alone isnt particularly surprising. the tariffs are expected to drive up the costs of goods in the united states, and have already sent the stock market into a nose dive. that means that a lot of aggrieved potential plaintiffs have standing to challenge the tariffs in court. what is surprising is that the plaintiff in this particular case, known as emily ley paper v. trump, is represented by the new civil liberties alliance ncla, a right-wing legal shop that previously backed trumps efforts to expand executive power. get the latest developments on the us supreme court from senior correspondent ian millhiser. ncla is part of what appears to be a growing effort among prominent right-leaning intellectuals and commentators to challenge trumps tariffs. at the volokh conspiracy, an influential right-libertarian legal blog, george mason law professor ilya somin is actively recruiting plaintiffs to file a similar lawsuit challenging the tariffs somin has long been a principled libertarian critic of trump. ben shapiro, the one-time breitbart writer who is also a lawyer, criticized trumps tariffs as a massive tax increase on american consumers, and has gently advocated for trump to change course. richard hanania, a writer best known for his baroque criticisms of wokeness, responded to a pro-trump member of congress praise of the tariffs with were ruled by morons. all of this matters because conservative-minded judges, including the six republicans who dominate the supreme court, are often highly responsive to public statements from conservative legal and media elites. during president barack obamas first term, for example, liberal lawyers and legal scholars were often flabbergasted by how quickly conservative judges rallied behind a weak legal case against the affordable care act eventually persuading four republican justices to vote to repeal the law altogether. their mistake one i made as well was assuming that judges would be persuaded by the kind of careful, precedent-focused legal reasoning that earns you top grades in law school, rather than by what they were hearing from legal and political elites that they viewed as ideological allies. as yale law professor jack balkin wrote about that error, a legal argument can move from off the wall to on the wall because people and institutions are willing to put their reputations on the line and state that an argument formerly thought beyond the pale is not crazy at all. in the end, many judges cared more about what they heard on fox news or at an event hosted by the federalist society, than they did about what the supreme court said in gonzales v. raich 2005. at least on the surface, anyone who wants to challenge trumps tariffs faces a far more favorable legal landscape than obamacare opponents faced in 2010. during the obama and biden administrations, republican justices fabricated novel new legal doctrines, such as the so-called major questions doctrine, in order to strike down democratic policies they deemed too ambitious. they also threatened to revive old, once-discredited ideas like the nondelegation doctrine, which was used to frustrate president franklin d. roosevelts new deal. both of these doctrines are grounded in the idea that the judiciary has broad power to strike down policies established by the executive branch of the federal government, even if the executive can point to an act of congress that explicitly gives them the power to do what they want to do. the primary reason to be skeptical that the supreme court will actually apply one of these doctrines to strike down trumps tariffs is that the republican justices rollout of their new approach to executive power has been so partisan that it is hard not to suspect that they are acting in bad faith. the same six republican justices who said that democratic president joe bidens student loan forgiveness program was an egregious power grab, despite the fact that that program was authorized by a federal statute empowering the executive to waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs, also said that republican president donald trump is allowed to use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes. similarly, the best legal argument against trumps tariffs is rooted in the courts major questions doctrine, which holds that judges should cast a skeptical eye on executive branch actions of vast economic and political significance according to the budget lab at yale, the tariffs are expected to reduce the average american households real annual income by nearly 3,800. that seems like a matter of vast economic and political significance. but the short history of this major questions doctrine would give any serious legal scholar great pause. the idea that programs of vast economic and political significance are suspect was first articulated in utility air regulatory group v. epa 2014, in order to criticize a hypothetical environmental protection agency regulation that was never enacted, that no one ever proposed, and that likely would have shut down all construction of hotels in the united states if it had ever actually existed. a year later, the court used the major questions doctrine again to repudiate an imaginary health regulation that would have collapsed the individual health insurance markets in most states. having used these strawmen to invent a completely new legal doctrine that appears nowhere in the constitution or in any statute, the court let this major questions doctrine lay dormant for trumps entire first term only to revive it with a vengeance once a democrat became president. to date, the doctrine has only been used to strike down actual, rather than theoretical, policies during the biden administration. one of the most important questions looming over trumps second term is whether a republican supreme court will apply the same rules it invented to thwart democratic administrations to trump and his subordinates. we do not know yet how the justices will answer this question. but, as balkin writes, the answer is likely to be shaped by how elite conservatives in the legal profession, the media, and in elected office urge the justices to behave. one of the most important questions is whether elected republicans join groups like ncla or commentators like shapiro in criticizing the tariffs. what really accelerates the movement of constitutional arguments from off the wall to on the wall is neither intellectuals nor social movements, balkin wrote about the obamacare fight. instead, the most important factor is often what republicans in political office want the courts to do. when establishment politicians who, after all, have to stand for election and dont want to be thought out-of-touch to their constituents get behind a constitutional argument, they often help move it forward quickly, balkin wrote. for now, it remains to be seen whether members of congress, governors, and other top elected republicans will speak out against the tariffs once their constituents start to experience the pain of higher prices. but if you are hoping to see these tariffs go away, you should take the fact that the first spear targeting the tariffs was thrown by a prominent right-wing legal shop as a very positive sign. understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news

be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. people at the u.s. center for safesport knew a former police officer was the subject of an internal investigation for sex crimes at his former job but hired him anyway, according to details released wednesday by sen. chuck grassley, who is looking into the matter. grassley, r-iowa, the chairman of the senate judiciary committee, sent a letter this week to the centers ceo, juriese colon, asking more questions about why the organization hired jason krasley as an investigator even though it had knowledge of his potential legal trouble. you conceded that this was concerning information but hired him nonetheless after being unable to ascertain additional information, grassley wrote to colon, who had revealed that information to the senator in response to his original request in february, which stemmed from reporting by the associated press about krasleys arrests. i find this deeply troubling, grassley wrote. krasley has been charged with multiple sex crimes, including rape, sex trafficking and soliciting prostitution, from episodes that occurred during his time at the allentown, pennsylvania, police department, and before he was hired by the center in 2021. the center, which investigates sex-abuse cases in olympic sports, fired krasley in november, two months after learning of his initial arrest for allegedly stealing money the allentown police vice team had seized in a drug bust. later came krasleys arrest for sex crimes and, in june 2024, an arrest for harassment that was resolved in december. grassleys letter recounts what colon wrote to him that one of krasleys references during the hiring process shared with you that he was the subject of an internal investigation by the allentown police department. the case, the letter said, was based on statements from an alleged victim that the person later recanted. the center provided the ap with its response to grassley, dated march 14, in which colon writes that the case has triggered several changes in the centers vetting process. under the new rules, she wrote, this disclosure would have raised a red flag and prompted additional scrutiny into the alleged conduct that led to the internal investigation. colon outlined enhancements of the centers code of ethics and the addition of an ethics clause employees must adhere to. she said she is now personally interviewing all final candidates for jobs and that the center plans to contract with an outside consultant to review its recruiting and hiring process. she also said the center now checks the national decertification index ndi, which keeps track of discipline related to officer misconduct. the centers letter said krasley handled 124 cases, including 15 involving minors. he had 15 open cases when he was terminated. the center said there were no complaints of sexual misconduct while krasley worked there. the ex-cop is free on bail awaiting trial. his attorney has asserted his clients innocence in the sex-crime cases, which date to 2015, most recently calling them meritless and uncorroborated allegations from drug-addled and impaired prostitutes. the center has also hired a third-party firm to reach out to people whose cases were handled by the former cop. that carried potential to retraumatize victims, one of whom, jacqui stevenson, told the ap the centers outreach about a case that had long been resolved triggered a total panic attack. in her letter, colon explained that the two-month delay in firing krasley was because of a concerted effort not to take steps that would compromise the criminal investigation reasoning that did not sway grassley. i imagine you appreciate that impressions regarding safesports judgment in hiring and firing decisions impact impressions of safesports ability to properly investigate and resolve allegations of misconduct in the sports community, grassley wrote. grassley sent a separate letter to the centers chair, april holmes, saying there appears to be a lack of oversight by the board to adequately supervise the ceo . and other officers and directors in their duties to the organization. the senator questioned whether an increase in funding something colon has asked for from its current budget of around 21 million a year would solve its problems, some of which he suggested are rooted in the complex nature of resolving sex-abuse allegations. he said there is concern that safesport is not prioritizing serious sexual and child abuse cases over other cases, which is causing more serious cases to languish without proper investigation. there was criticism of the centers spending, including its 2.4 million in billing for legal services in 2023. also, grassley pointed out 50,000 on dues and subscriptions, 36,000 on bank fees and credit cards and more than 390,000 on travel, all expenses that seem excessive for a non-profit organization and financial decisions that seem counter-productive to the organization. grassley asked holmes to answer a series of questions, including how the board determined salaries for executives, including colon, who made more than 400,000 in 2023, which included a 58,000 bonus. ap sports httpsapnews.comhubsports

  Title: Reams of documents related to L.A. County sex abuse cases never turned over, lawyers say
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:11:23)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article illustrates aspects of the Principal-Agent Problem within the context of public institutions. The county (the principal, representing the public interest) delegates authority to its probation staff (the agents). The text highlights alleged failures of the agents (abuse) and a potential failure of the principal (the county) to adequately oversee, document, and respond to these actions over decades, as evidenced by the discovery dispute and the large settlement payout. This suggests a breakdown in the mechanisms designed to ensure agents act in the best interest of the principal and those they serve.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative around AB 218 and subsequent legislative proposals (like SB 577) reflects elements of Agenda-Setting Theory. The large volume of lawsuits enabled by AB 218 (an event/policy) has forced the issue of institutional liability and financial burden onto the legislative agenda, prompting lawmakers to propose new bills aimed at managing the fallout. The framing by Senator Laird about 'restoring equilibrium' suggests an attempt to shape the public and legislative perception of the problem and the proposed solution.

  Content: thousands of documents that could contain key details about rampant childhood sexual abuse inside a defunct santa clarita detention camp including so-called grooming drawings were left scattered inside the facility and never turned over to the victims attorneys, according to a firm suing l.a. county over the decades-old incidents. as part of the preparation for a looming june trial, attorneys with law firm manly, stewart finaldi had arranged april 15 to visit camp scott, a shuttered l.a. county probation camp where many of their clients say they were sexually abused as children. inside the facility were reams of records that the county should have turned over to the firm more than a year ago through discovery, said attorney courtney thom, whose firm has about 150 civil cases alleging sexual abuse by county probation staff. you can understand my shock when im walking through where my clients got raped as children, and there are documents everywhere, thom said at a monday superior court hearing in downtown los angeles. thom said she discovered thousands of paper grievances, a locked file cabinet labeled personnel files camps a w, and a drawing she believed was signed by thomas jackson a probation deputy accused by at least 20 women of sexually assaulting them at the camp. the drawing, included in a court filing, was of the name tami in big, block orange letters and appeared to be signed by a jackson. t. attorney james sargent, who is representing the county and accompanied thom for the tour last week, called her claims inflammatory and incorrect. they want to air what they deem as dirty laundry, said sargent, who told l.a. superior court judge lawrence riff that the personnel files they discovered had nothing to do with the staff named in the lawsuits. nor did the drawing, he said. tami wilson, a former supervisor at the camp, told him she recalled being given the hand-drawn card by a youth, he wrote in a court filing. the county announced earlier this month they planned to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of alleged sexual abuse inside the countys juvenile facilities and foster homes. the settlement believed to be the largest sex abuse settlement in u.s. history arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to file civil suits against alleged predators and the agencies that employed them. a handful of prominent firms including manly, stewart finaldi declined to participate in the settlement and have ongoing litigation. in the aftermath of ab 218, state legislators have introduced several bills to attempt to make it easier for governments and school districts to deal with the financial fallout from the deluge of suits. one of these bills sb 577 is set for a hearing tuesday. the bills author, state sen. john laird, said the legislation is intended to restore some equilibrium, lessening the financial blow to public agencies while still upholding a victims right to sue. county lawyers claim one reason the state law change has had such a devastating financial toll is because many of the records they need to fight decades-old cases are long gone. attorney john manly argued the claim flew in the face of what his firm saw at camp scott. the county has been telling all of sacramento that they dont have any documents, said manly, who urged the judge to allow his firm to publicize the footage theyd taken of the heaps of documents. we need to be able to share this with legislators. riff agreed with the countys request that the videos from inside camp scott remain confidential for now due to security risks, though he instructed both sides to try to find some common ground on whether certain videos could be made public. though camp scott hasnt been used to house youths for years, sargent wrote in a filing that may soon change. l.a. county superior court judge miguel espinoza ordered the county friday to prepare to shut down los padrinos juvenile hall the countys last remaining juvenile hall, where roughly 270 youths are held due to problems stemming from chronic understaffing. the youth presently in los padrinos will need to go somewhere, and if some wind up at camp scott, the public release of photos and videos could be seriously detrimental, sargent wrote. thom noted that both reporters and television crews have been allowed to broadcast footage taken inside the camp, including a 2001 documentary, camp scott lock-up. the l.a. times has been in there to photograph, said thom. mtv videoed more than we did.

  Content: the former law firm of second lady usha vance, which calls itself proudly progressive, has gone to court to fight president trumps efforts to bludgeon his legal foes into submission. lawfare makes for strange bedfellows. as part of his tightening grip on power, and his assault on 200-plus years of checks and balances, president trump has bludgeoned some of the nations leading law firms into shameful submission, extracting hundreds of millions of dollars worth of free legal work for his pet causes. more significantly, the vengeful felon-in-chief has sent a clear-cut message oppose his heedless, plainly unconstitutional actions in court one of the only avenues left to fight trumps creeping authoritarianism and there will be a dear price to pay. given that choice between principle and profits many high-powered litigators have collapsed like a cheap umbrella. but not all. last week, the l.a.-based law firm munger, tolles olson filed a federal court brief denouncing trumps targeting of perkins coie which numbered hillary clinton among past clients and other legal firms facing wrongful retribution for, among other things, holding the jan. 6 rioters to account. trumps actions pose a grave threat to our system of constitutional governance and to the rule of law itself, the firm said in its brief. the looming threat . is not lost on anyone practicing law in this country today any controversial representation challenging actions of the current administration or even causes it disfavors now brings with it the risk of devastating retaliation. voices calmes the case that proves the u.s., under trump, no longer stands for rule of law the trump administrations refusal to facilitate the return of kilmar abrego garcia is an attack on our most basic expectations of american justice. the ranks of munger, tolles used to include one usha vance, who resigned in the summer after her husband, jd, was chosen as trumps vice presidential running mate and avenging mini-me. small world. the political views of americas second lady are something of a well-kept mystery. though she clerked for the conservative chief justice john g. roberts jr. and the even-more conservative judge brett m. kavanaugh before his ascension to the supreme court, vance was a registered democrat until at least 2014. by signing on with munger, tolles, the yale law school graduate embraced a firm that describes its corporate culture as radically progressive. its reputation is no secret. in a 2019 column, the american lawyer called munger, tolles a top contender in the cool, woke category which is about as far removed from the trump world groove as it gets. kind of like a drag queen showing up at a maga picnic. its impossible to know whats going on inside vances head as she finds her old law firm so fiercely at odds with her new political peer group. but there was a definite hostage-video vibe to her appearances during the presidential campaign, giving students of body language a speculative field day. also worth noting the second ladys mom is a uc san diego provost and big promoter of diversity, equity and inclusion which trump regards with the enmity other presidents once reserved for al qaeda and the former soviet union. who wouldnt love to be a fly on the wall when the extended vance family gets together? as it happens, the nations former second gentleman, as doug emhoff was known, is also crossways with his legal firm. kamala harris spouse, a longtime entertainment, media and intellectual property attorney in los angeles, joined the white-shoe law firm of willkie farr gallagher after the former vice president left the white house. this month, willkie farr caved to trumps intimidation campaign, agreeing to provide at least 100 million in pro bono legal work during trumps presidency and beyond. the firms services will be dedicated to helping veterans, gold star families, law enforcement offices and first responders all unarguably meritorious individuals deserving of support. still, blackmail is no way to enlist the firms good counsel. by coincidence, emhoff spoke to georgetown law school students shortly before a preening trump announced willkie farrs surrender on social media. politics defying courts in deportation cases, trump risks a tipping point, experts say president trumps defiance of court orders in a case involving a resident of maryland being wrongly deported to a salvadoran prison has pushed the country to a constitutional tipping point, according to legal experts. the rule of law is under attack. democracy is under attack, emhoff said. and so, all of us lawyers need to do what we can to push back on that. us lawyers have always been on the front lines, fighting for civil rights, for justice. . i love being a lawyer, this is what we do we fight for people. we fight for whats right. emhoff subsequently made known his unhappiness with the firms capitulation, though hes stopped short of quitting as some have urged to protest its bended knee. i disagree with the decision that my firm made to settle i do, he said at a recent los angeles fundraiser for bet tzedek, a legal aid organization emhoff has supported for more than 30 years. i wanted them to fight a patently unconstitutional potential executive order. our legal system depends on the willingness of institutions law firms, clients to stand firm, and stand together, he went on. they need to do that in the face of pressure and we need to do it to defend the principles that define our democracy. at this very critical moment, i urge my colleagues across the legal profession to remain vigilant, engaged and unafraid to challenge actions that may erode our fundamental rights. emhoffs summons was a clarion call, crisp and clear. would that a certain resident of the vice presidential mansion add her public voice to the fight to preserve the rule of law and protect our imperiled democracy.

  Title: Judge Denies L.A. DA Motion To Delay Menendez Brothers’ Resentencing Hearing, Defense Lawyer Accuses Prosecution Of Playing Politics With Case

the answer is not no. the answer is not yet. and the reason i say not yet is that we have identified a pathway for the menendez brothers to come forward acknowledge all the lies they have told for the past 30 years. and then at that point, if they do it, unequivocally and sincerely, and they convince the court, because ultimately the court has to make the decision here, then they can then say to the court, we have come clean, we have been rehabilitated. we no longer constitute a risk of danger to society. but until that happens, the answer is not yet for resentencing. even before the da spoke thursday, geragos wasnt buying it, and accused the ambitious hochman of playing politics with the menendez brothers fate and their familys emotions why is it that this da is abusing the victims? the media-savvy attorney rhetorically asked. why is it that he thinks its appropriate to go hold a press conference when one of his actions 30 hours later, arguably put one of the matriarch of this family into the hospital after being found unresponsive, geragos added of the horrific 1989 crime scene photos showing josé menendez which have been made public before that were unexpectedly flashed on screen during an april 11 pre-hearing session. i would ask you to ask the da why, at the last minute, he does a hail mary filing of a motion to continue and does not notify any of the victims or the victims lawyer, why? geragos added. what is going on? whose interest is he vindicating ask him if hes vindicating his victims rights, the publics rights, or if hes just trying to placate some disgruntled da is in his own office for political purposes? amid this weeks resentencing hearings, newsom will ultimately make the final decision on all this after early last month ordering a risk assessment of the brothers to inform a clemency request on his desk since late 2024. the brothers are set to appear individually before the parole board june 13. after getting recommendations from the board, who would have to oversee any potential resentencing and pass that on to newsom, the governor will announce his decision. under the twists of california law, if jesic does determines that the menendez brothers life without parole sentence should be reassessed, it is actually the state parole board that conducts a probe into the matter which, with the way things have turned out, puts this all in the governors hands either way. best of deadline sign up for deadlines newsletter. for the latest news, follow us on facebook, twitter, and instagram.

  Title: In unprecedented payout, L.A. County will settle sex abuse claims for $4 billion
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-04 16:30:44)
  Content: a woman who alleges she was sexually assaulted as a child at the now-closed maclaren childrens center. thousands of former foster children have sued, alleging abuse by staff there. los angeles county plans to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of childhood sexual abuse that allegedly occurred inside its juvenile facilities and foster homes, dwarfing the largest sex abuse settlements in u.s. history. the mammoth settlement, which still needs to be approved by both the county claims board and county supervisors, is a billion dollars more than what county officials had anticipated as the worst-case scenario to resolve a flurry of lawsuits and far more than other organizations notorious for allowing unchecked sex abuse have paid victims. the boy scouts of america, by comparison, agreed to pay 2.46 billion. the archdiocese of los angeles has paid out about 1.5 billion for alleged abuse at the hands of catholic priests. victims of usc gynecologist george tyndall got 1.1 billion. michigan state university paid 500 million to victims of team doctor larry nassar. the unprecedented settlement stems from ab 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to sue, even though the statute of limitations had expired. many california counties, which are responsible for the care of children in foster homes and juvenile halls, saw an uptick in lawsuits. for l.a. county, it was a deluge that still hasnt stopped. thousands of men and women came forward to say they had been molested or raped by probation officials decades ago while incarcerated as children in the countys sprawling network of juvenile halls and camps. thousands more alleged sexual abuse at the now-shuttered maclaren childrens center , a county-run home for foster children that plaintiffs attorneys have compared to a house of horrors. a report found that the facility went decades without doing criminal background checks on its staff. taken together, the thousands of lawsuits, most of which involve alleged abuse from the 1980s through the 2000s, paint a picture of a government that failed to intervene as its facilities turned into hunting grounds for predators, who held immense power over the children in their custody. on behalf of the county, i apologize wholeheartedly to everyone who was harmed by these reprehensible acts, said l.a. county chief executive officer fesia davenport in a statement. she said the county has worked in recent years to crack down on sexual abuse of minors. improvements touted by the county include bolstering the vetting of foster parents and probation staffers and winding down the use of group homes like maclaren childrens center. davenport made headlines in 2023 when she estimated in a public budget hearing that the county could be looking at 1.6 billion to 3 billion in liability for the roughly 3,000 sex abuse claims it expected. her estimate was met with shock and a dash of skepticism from seasoned attorneys suing the county, who said it would blow any previous sex abuse payout out of the water. since then, thousands of additional victims have sued, with more coming forward every month. in addition to creating a three-year window for victims, which closed at the end of 2023 , the new state law let plaintiffs sue if they were under the age of 40 or had recently discovered the abuse they suffered as children. the county said the 4-billion settlement covers most but not all of the childhood sexual abuse lawsuits. some attorneys were not willing to participate in the global mediation process, and negotiations are underway with plaintiffs in those cases, according to the county. the settlement does not include any of the 150 cases filed by manly, stewart finaldi, one of the most high-profile sex-abuse law firms negotiating with the county, according to courtney thom, a partner with the firm. resolving those cases could end up costing the county millions more. patrick mcnicholas, whose law firm is representing 1,200 plaintiffs, said he was mindful during settlement discussions to reach for a number that would bring some justice to the thousands of victims without bankrupting the county, which serves as the regions social safety net. he reasoned that the government could stay solvent with a 4-billion payout and yet it was still the largest sex abuse payout he has ever heard of. this is a historic settlement, he said, noting that he couldnt find a larger sex abuse settlement anywhere in the world. it recognizes the horrific harm that has been done. dominique anderson, pictured around age 11, is one of thousands of plaintiffs who have sued over abuse at the countys juvenile faculties. anderson said her probation officers boss molested her in a motel room when she was around 13. dominique anderson the 4-billion payout will be a huge blow to a county already in tumultuous financial waters, thanks to threats of funding cuts from the trump white house and the cost of recovering from the devastating palisades and eaton wildfires. davenport has warned that the county government , which has a roughly 49-billion budget, could face a fiscal crisis unless hiring is frozen. county officials have said the money will come from draining the countys rainy day fund, slashing department budgets and taking out bonds. the county is expected to owe hundreds of millions of dollars in interest on those bonds, which have to be paid off by 2051. the county said it will pay out the settlement money between january 2026 and jan. 30, 2030, providing the billions to independent allocators who will decide how to divvy it up among the roughly 6,800 plaintiffs. there have been few criminal prosecutions of county staffers accused of abuse in the lawsuits. the probation department presented the l.a. county district attorneys office with evidence against two staff members, thomas jackson and altovise abner, in december 2023. the status of those cases was not immediately available.

This suggests an attempt to frame the case in a way that resonates with pre-existing public concerns, potentially influencing jury perception and minimizing focus on the defense's conspiracy claims.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the defense was prevented from implicating Colin Albert in their opening statements. This is intriguing because it suggests a limitation on the defense's ability to present their full case. What is the justification for this limitation, and how might it impact the jury's perception of the defense's claims?

  Title: In unprecedented payout, L.A. County will settle sex abuse claims for $4 billion - Los Angeles Times
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-04 22:24:33)
  Content: los angeles county plans to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of childhood sexual abuse that allegedly occurred inside its juvenile facilities and foster homes, dwarfing the largest sex abuse settlements in u.s. history. the mammoth settlement, which still needs to be approved by both the county claims board and county supervisors, is a billion dollars more than what county officials had anticipated as the worst-case scenario to resolve a flurry of lawsuits and far more than other organizations notorious for allowing unchecked sex abuse have paid victims. the boy scouts of america, by comparison, agreed to pay 2.46 billion. the archdiocese of los angeles has paid out about 1.5 billion for alleged abuse at the hands of catholic priests. victims of usc gynecologist george tyndall got 1.1 billion. michigan state university paid 500 million to victims of team doctor larry nassar. this is the largest sex abuse settlement in history, said adam slater, a lead attorney in both the l.a. county and boy scouts settlements. the unprecedented settlement arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to sue, even though the statute of limitations had expired. many california counties, which are responsible for the care of children in foster homes and juvenile halls, saw an uptick in lawsuits. for l.a. county, it was a deluge that still hasnt stopped. thousands of men and women came forward to say they had been molested or raped by probation officials decades ago while incarcerated as children in the countys sprawling network of juvenile halls and camps. thousands more alleged sexual abuse at the now-shuttered maclaren childrens center, a county-run home for foster children that plaintiffs attorneys have compared to a house of horrors. a report found that the facility went decades without doing criminal background checks on its staff. when i heard the news, it felt like my heart had a door and it slammed shut, said maryalice ashbrook, 65, who was sent to maclaren as an 8-year-old in the early 1960s. ive gone to great lengths to block this out, and still, i deal with reoccurring nightmares. both ashbrook and her friend shirley bodkin, 58, who filed some of the earliest ab 218 cases against l.a. county, said the hall where they spent part of their childhoods was rife with predatory staff. im in total shock, said bodkin, who recalled being drugged, beaten and sexually abused in bathtubs and closets. ive been waiting all these years for this outcome. taken together, the thousands of lawsuits, most of which involve alleged abuse from the 1980s through the 2000s, paint a picture of a government that failed to intervene as its facilities turned into hunting grounds for predators, who held immense power over the children in their custody. on behalf of the county, i apologize wholeheartedly to everyone who was harmed by these reprehensible acts, said l.a. county chief executive officer fesia davenport in a statement. she said the county has worked in recent years to crack down on sexual abuse of minors. improvements touted by the county include bolstering the vetting of foster parents and probation staffers and winding down the use of group homes like maclaren childrens center. davenport made headlines in 2023 when she estimated in a public budget hearing that the county could be looking at 1.6 billion to 3 billion in liability for the roughly 3,000 sex abuse claims it expected. her estimate was met with shock and a dash of skepticism from seasoned attorneys suing the county, who said it would blow any previous sex abuse payout out of the water. since then, thousands of additional victims have sued, with more coming forward every month. in addition to creating a three-year window for victims, which closed at the end of 2023, the new state law let plaintiffs sue if they were under the age of 40 or had recently discovered the abuse they suffered as children. the county said the 4-billion settlement covers most but not all of the childhood sexual abuse lawsuits. some attorneys were not willing to participate in the global mediation process, and negotiations are underway with plaintiffs in those cases, according to the county. the settlement does not include any of the 150 cases filed by manly, stewart finaldi, one of the most high-profile sex-abuse law firms negotiating with the county, according to courtney thom, a partner with the firm. resolving those cases could end up costing the county millions more. patrick mcnicholas, whose law firm is representing 1,200 plaintiffs, said he was mindful during settlement discussions to reach for a number that would bring some justice to the thousands of victims without bankrupting the county, which serves as the regions social safety net. he reasoned that the government could stay solvent with a 4-billion payout and yet it was still the largest sex abuse payout he has ever heard of. this is a historic settlement, he said. it recognizes the horrific harm that has been done. the 4-billion payout will be a huge blow to a county already in tumultuous financial waters, thanks to threats of funding cuts from the trump white house and the cost of recovering from the devastating palisades and eaton wildfires. davenport has warned that the county government, which has a roughly 49-billion budget, could face a fiscal crisis unless hiring is frozen. county officials have said the money will come from draining the countys rainy day fund and taking out bonds. the county is expected to owe hundreds of millions of dollars in interest on those bonds, which have to be paid off by 2051. the county budget will also need to be slashed, davenport warned department heads in a friday email. it is unprecedented by all accounts, she wrote. after you recover from the shock of the settlement amount and how it will impact your budgets, we must regain focus and turn towards the work ahead of us. the county said it will pay out the money between january 2026 and jan. 30, 2030, providing the billions to independent allocators who will decide how to divvy it up among the roughly 6,800 plaintiffs. we hope that this settlement, once approved, can bring some measure of healing to those who experienced abuse and help them in rebuilding their lives, the board of supervisors, which is expected to approve the settlement later this month, wrote in a joint statement. there have been few criminal prosecutions of county staffers accused of abuse in the lawsuits. the probation department presented the l.a. county district attorneys office with evidence against two staff members, thomas jackson and altovise abner, in december 2023. the status of those cases was not immediately available. some of the employees accused of being the most prolific abusers were on the county payroll until recently. jackson resigned from the probation department in fall 2023, ending a 33-year career during which at least 20 women accused him of sexually abused them when they were girls.

  Content: reuters. file photo signage is seen at the legal offices of the law firm willkie farr gallagher in new york city, new york, u.s., may 19, 2021. reutersandrew kellyfile photo reuters - this april 1 story has been corrected to show that willkie has agreed to not engage in illegal diversity-related employment practices, not that it will end diversity-based hiring practices, in paragraph 2 the law firm of former vice president kamala harriss husband struck a deal with donald trump to avert an executive order targeting its business, becoming the latest firm to cut a deal with the u.s. president as he seeks to punish perceived enemies in the legal profession. willkie farr gallagher, whose partners include harris husband, doug emhoff, agreed to provide 100 million in free legal services to mutually agreed-upon projects with the trump administration and not to engage in illegal diversity-related employment practices. major law firms with ties to attorneys who have investigated trump or which have been involved in challenges to his policies have been targeted with executive orders aimed at restricting their business with the federal government. law firms paul weiss and skadden arps also reached agreements with the administration, as the divide between how to respond to trump deepens in the legal community. three firms have challenged the administration in court and two judges struck down key provisions of the orders on friday. willkie farrs leadership said in an internal email seen by reuters that the deal prevents trump from signing an executive order that could have imperiled the firm and its clients, though it acknowledged dissent about the decision. we know this news is not welcomed by some of you and you would have urged a different course of action. needless to say, this was an incredibly difficult decision for firm leadership, willkie farrs executive committee said in the email. emhoff, whose wife served in the administration of democratic president joe biden, told willkie farrs leadership that he disagreed with a decision to seek a deal with the trump administration and said they should fight back, a person familiar with the matter told reuters. emhoff did not immediately respond to a request for comment. during an event tuesday at georgetown law school before the deal was announced, he told students the rule of law is under attack, and lawyers need to do what we can to push back. in a statement announcing the deal with willkie farr on tuesday, the white house said the firm proactively reached out to president trump and his administration, offering their decisive commitment to ending the weaponization of the justice system and the legal profession. willkie farr chairmen thomas cerabino and matthew feldman said in a statement that the substance of the firms agreement with trump is consistent with our firms longstanding practices. willkie farr employs 1,200 lawyers in the u.s. and five other countries. three law firms - perkins coie, wilmerhale and jenner block - have sued the administration over executive orders seeking to cancel their contracts with the government and block their attorneys from accessing federal buildings. judges have blocked key provisions of those orders. one said it was disturbing that jenner appeared to be targeted for its representation of transgender people and immigrants, and another said the wilmerhale order would have severe spillover effects on the justice system. perkins coie, wilmerhale and jenner are among more than a dozen law firms representing plaintiffs in legal challenges to trumps policies. in striking deals with the administration to rescind or avoid similar orders against them, paul weiss and skadden arps said they would earmark money for free legal services for mutually agreeable projects with the white house. skadden executive partner jeremy london said in a statement that it had engaged proactively with trump in the interests of clients, employees and the firm. with valuations skyrocketing in 2024, many investors are uneasy putting more money into stocks. unsure where to invest next? get access to our proven portfolios and discover high-potential opportunities. in 2024 alone, propicks ai identified 2 stocks that surged over 150, 4 additional stocks that leaped over 30, and 3 more that climbed over 25. thats an impressive track record. with portfolios tailored for dow stocks, sp stocks, tech stocks, and mid cap stocks, you can explore various wealth-building strategies. by signing up you agree to our terms conditions and

  Title: Daywatch: Momentum builds for nuclear power in Illinois - Chicago Tribune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-14 12:35:47)
  Content: subscribers are entitled to 10 gift sharing articles each month. these can be shared with friends and family who are not subscribers. ! or sign in to your account. good morning, chicago. less than a year ago, two elgin detectives were named to the police departments new cold case unit. soon after chief ana lalley presented the units first and, so far, only members with an unconventional idea what if, in the spirit of generating interest and leads, detectives andrew houghton and matt vartanian regularly shared their work with the public? what if they even hosted a podcast? the detectives were dubious. they had listened to true crime podcasts before and even liked some of them. and they knew their first case the disappearance of karen schepers in april 1983 would make a compelling story. but to put a podcast together, themselves, and host it? to investigate the most difficult cases, often ones that have gone unsolved for decades, and take an audience along for the ride for the improbable victories and inevitable failures? to share with the world their search for karen schepers, a young elgin woman missing for more than 40 years? the detectives had plenty of reasons to be skeptical. their chief pushed them to do it, anyway and it worked. read the full story from the tribunes andrew carter. here are the top stories you need to know to start your day, including a look at the coal industry in illinois, a backstage tour of the cadillac palace where a touring production of moulin rouge! rolled into town with nearly 300 costumes and where to make a reservation for easter brunch. todays enewspaper edition subscribe to more newsletters asking eric horoscopes puzzles games today in history as illinois closes in on its deadline of being carbon-free by midcentury, even as demands for energy rise, legislators are looking to satisfy both needs through a strategy many so far have tried to avoid allowing new, large-scale nuclear reactors to be built in the state. gov. jb pritzker used his first-ever appearance on fox news to take his criticisms of president donald trumps sweeping tariffs to the networks conservative-leaning audience, labeling the republican administrations levies on imports taxes on working families. like a tv networks summer reruns, trump is back with a pro-coal agenda. among his targets are illinois and other states with their own clean energy laws, which promise to end the nations use of coal to generate electricity and wean the nation from gas-fired power. industry data tell another story. coal, once a dominant sector of the economy, is in steep decline because it cant compete against cleaner, less-expensive energy sources. when mayor brandon johnson came into office, his handpicked city council ethics leader hoped the new mayor promising big change might truly reform the rules meant to keep elected officials in line in the famously corrupt city. but then johnson instead fought those efforts, ethics committee chair ald. matt martin said. and he has done so again and again. the footage of two women brutally attacking a server at taco azteca, a longtime mexican restaurant in pilsen, last weekend has left a neighborhood reeling, according to residents and local leaders. the now viral video has raised concerns of safety in the neighborhood and left other workers in the area fearful. as police continue the search for the two aggressors, the images of the beating over a 50 check still haunt some of the other workers at the restaurant, said co-owner martha garcia. the worst-case scenario has come to fruition for chicago cubs left-hander justin steele. steele will undergo season-ending surgery friday to repair the flexor tendon in his elbow and address the ulnar collateral ligament ucl, manager craig counsell announced yesterday. the extent of the damage to steeles ucl wont be known until the doctor gets eyes on it during the procedure. the cubs will have a better timetable for steeles recovery after the surgery. the chicago sky loaded up on late first-round draft stock in a trade with the minnesota lynx. the sky announced they acquired the no. 11 pick in the 2025 draft in exchange for the rights to their 2026 first-round pick. this trade nullified the pick swap that minnesota initially gained in last years trade for the no. 7 draft pick, which the sky ultimately used to select angel reese. the sky now own the nos. 10, 11, 16 and 22 picks in tonights draft. chicagos field of dreams was born on an early spring day in 1938. mel thillens awoke to the sight of his kid brother standing next to his bed. ferdy thillens said he and his buddies needed a place to play softball. we put a plate in a prairie, and it just grew from there, mel thillens subsequently recalled to a tribune reporter. prairie was chicagoese for an empty lot. in this instance, it meant a substantial piece of land north of kedzie and devon avenues. each time the nationally touring production of moulin rouge! rolls into a new city, an entire truck is required to transport the shows costumes a rainbow palette of corsets, cancan skirts, tailcoats, top hats and heeled boots that evokes the opulence of the 1899 parisian setting. in total, the production travels with 297 costumes for the principal actors and ensemble performers, plus about 200 for understudies and swings. moulin rouge! the musical is currently playing through april 20 at the cadillac palace theatre. at a time when palestinian existence and resilience are under a microscope, the chicago palestine film festival is spotlighting all aspects of palestinian culture and tradition with the 24th annual event, which began saturday. much of the film festival, which runs through april 26, takes place at the gene siskel film center and includes many screenings as well as panel discussions and social gatherings. easter is one of the biggest brunch occasions of the year, but also a time for hearty dinners centering on roast lamb and honey-baked ham, and baskets filled with sweet treats. celebrations at chicago restaurants run the gamut, featuring decadent buffets, egg decorating, a traditional midnight feast and a drag show. whether youre seeking a meal where the kids can meet the easter bunny or looking for someone else to cook the food for your at-home gathering, these 70 restaurants are providing all the goodies. subscribers are entitled to 10 gift sharing articles each month. these can be shared with friends and family who are not subscribers. !

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
