  Title: Police seize enough fentanyl ‘to kill everyone in Portland twice,’ arrest 46 in multi-agency trafficking crackdown
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-22 23:31:33)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article highlights a state-level response (law enforcement agencies) to a perceived threat (fentanyl trafficking) originating from a non-state actor (Sinaloa Cartel) across international borders. This aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize security and power in an anarchic international system. The quote 'our partnership with local, state, and federal agencies makes our collective response stronger' exemplifies the state's attempt to consolidate power to address the threat.; Intriguing_angles: The article emphasizes the success of the operation and the collaboration between agencies, but it doesn't delve into the root causes of the drug crisis or the social factors contributing to drug use and trafficking. This omission could be a deliberate choice to focus on the immediate law enforcement response rather than addressing the more complex underlying issues. What are the long-term strategies to address the root causes of drug trafficking and addiction in Portland?

  Title: 100 DAYS OF PUNISHING FOES...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article demonstrates how Trump actively shapes the public's perception by prioritizing certain narratives (e.g., 'political weaponization,' 'lies and abuses') and repeatedly emphasizing them. The text states Trump 'repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate' and 'denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him.' This constant reinforcement influences which issues voters deem important, potentially overshadowing other concerns.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the speed and scope of Trump's actions, noting that 'even the smallest slights drawing reprisals.' This suggests a potential underlying mechanism of personal vendettas driving policy decisions, raising questions about the stability and predictability of the administration's actions. What are the long-term consequences of such personalized governance?; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work.' This raises questions about the ethical implications of such arrangements and whether they constitute a form of extortion or coercion. Does this set a dangerous precedent for future interactions between the government and private entities?

  Content: reuters -hours after swearing an oath to defend the u.s. constitution on january 20, president donald trump signed an executive order directing his attorney general to scour the justice department and other agencies for evidence of political weaponization. the same day, pentagon staff took down a portrait of mark milley, a trump critic who as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been the highest-ranking military officer during trumps first term. that evening, trump stripped his former national security adviser, john bolton - who wrote a memoir critical of trump - of the protective secret service detail he had been given after the justice department said iran had threatened boltons life. in his first 100 days, trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies. these include former intelligence officials who investigated alleged russian ties to his 2016 election campaign and major law firms as well as former biden administration members and prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against him while he was out of power. trumps actions served notice that his campaign promise of political retribution was anything but rhetorical, after he repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate. but the speed and sweep of his actions have caught many by surprise, with even the smallest slights drawing reprisals. the republican president has used the machinery of the state and the power of the presidency to go after people and institutions that have aggrieved him in more expansive ways than any of his predecessors, historians said. its not unusual for presidents to have enemies, said jeremi suri, a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin. what is unusual is for the president to use the entirety of the federal government, not simply to exclude someone, but to directly punish them. trump has made particular use of executive orders - typically used by presidents to direct policy priorities - to target perceived foes by stripping them of security clearances, blocking them from government buildings or directing agencies to probe them for wrongdoing. he has launched multiple federal probes into maine after a verbal spat with the states governor, reached deep into the traditionally independent justice department to fire those he views as disloyal, pulled protective security details from his critics and ordered investigations into former officials who challenged his false claims that his 2020 election loss was rigged. on his first day in office, he removed clearances for 50 former national security officials who had signed a letter suggesting russia was behind a story about salacious material found on a laptop belonging to president joe bidens son hunter. no evidence of russian involvement has emerged. he has also taken away clearances for all three democrats who ran against him in presidential contests biden, hillary clinton and kamala harris. trump has focused much of his attention on the criminal justice system after claiming during his 2024 presidential campaign that his four indictments were motivated by politics. then-president joe bidens administration denied the accusations. in trumps first 100 days, his justice department has fired or demoted dozens of officials, prosecutors and fbi agents, including rank-and-file employees who worked on investigations into trump and the january 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob of trump supporters. in a speech at the justice departments headquarters in february, trump denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him with illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. traditional presidencies have failed to bring meaningful change to the ways of washington, and the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy, a white house spokesman, harrison fields, said in response to questions about trumps retribution efforts and whether they represent an abuse of power. utilizing every tool afforded by the constitution, the trump administration is prioritizing efficiency eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and fulfilling every campaign promise. the ferocity and the scope during his first term, trumps instincts for revenge were sometimes thwarted by his own appointees, many of whom were experienced government hands or establishment republicans. by contrast, trump has filled his second-term administration with steadfast loyalists more likely to back his directives than caution against them. meanwhile, the republican majority in congress has shown little interest in opposing his actions. trump has taken steps as well to eliminate internal watchdogs who might seek to constrain him, purging inspectors general and firing government ethics officials. all administrations, particularly when you see a switch from one party to another, seek to control the executive branch, said historian timothy naftali, the former director of the richard nixon presidential library and museum. its the ferocity and the scope of what hes done that makes it unprecedented. the republican nixon famously had a list of enemies, but he plotted against them in secret. his most aggressive ideas, such as using the tax-collecting internal revenue service to audit his foes, were often blocked by his own officials. other presidents have used their power to penalize rivals in more muted ways, suri said. democrat lyndon johnson sought to discredit his political rival, robert kennedy, in the news media, and republican george w. bush banned brent scowcroft, a former national security adviser, from the white house after scowcroft wrote a column opposing the iraq war. thats often how presidents use their power to go after enemies they keep them out of their administration and spread rumors about them, suri said. trump has frequently intertwined his personal animus against political opponents with his administrations ideological and policy objectives. in february, trump digressed from remarks during a white house meeting with governors to address maine governor janet mills, warning her to comply with an order banning transgender athletes. see you in court, mills, a democrat, replied defiantly. within a day, three separate federal departments had initiated inquiries into whether the state was violating civil rights law, imperiling millions of dollars in federal funding. the justice department sent mills a letter telling her maine was on notice while trump demanded a full-throated apology before the case can be settled. in early april, trumps agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, wrote mills to confirm that some school funding had been frozen. this is only the beginning, rollins warned her. nine days later, the education department said it was taking steps to cut off all federal school funding to the state, and last week attorney general pam bondi announced the justice department had sued maine in federal court. in recent weeks, trump has attacked law firms that once employed attorneys he views as enemies, arguing they undermined the judicial process by doing so. in february, he suspended security clearances for attorneys at the law firm covington burling who had represented smith, the former special counsel investigating him, and sought to cancel any government work the firm had. making little effort to hide his primary motivation, trump suggested sending the pen he used to sign the order to smith as a souvenir. trump has signed executive orders targeting five other law firms, in each case indicating that revenge was an essential factor. his order punishing wilmerhale, for instance, noted that it once employed robert mueller, who investigated whether trumps 2016 campaign had improper connections with russia. nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work on mutually agreed projects backed by the administration. in some cases, trump simply appears determined to get even with former members of his 2017-2021 administration who irked him. this month, the president ordered the justice department to investigate christopher krebs, his former cybersecurity chief who disputed trumps false claims about election fraud in 2020, and miles taylor, a former homeland security official who anonymously wrote a 2019 book critical of trump. signing the executive order targeting the two former officials, trump called taylor a traitor. i think hes guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth, but well find out, he said. dissent isnt unlawful, taylor responded on x. it certainly isnt treasonous. reporting by joseph ax editing by ross colvin and howard goller

  Title: Team Trump Drafts Dystopian Plan to Get Women to Have More Babies
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-21 20:02:55)
  Content: the trump administration is trying to figure out how to get american women to have more babies, according to the new york times. they are exploring options like reserving 30 percent of fulbright scholarships to applicants who are parents andor married, giving mothers that 5,000 baby bonus that trump promised during the campaign season, and even a government-funded program to better educate women on their own menstrual cycles so that they know when they should be trying for a baby. the administration has not yet settled on its final plan, according to the times report. the president wants america to be a country where all children can safely grow up and achieve the american dream, press secretary karoline leavitt said in a statement. as a mother myself, i am proud to work for a president who is taking significant action to leave a better country for the next generation. the impetus for this right-wing pronatalism is undeniably project 2025 and the white ethnonationalists at the heart of it. vice president jd vance has also made childbearing a focus point, noting at the 2025 march for life that he wanted more babies in the united states of america and more beautiful young men and women to parent them. he also infamously described the democratic party as full of childless cat ladies who are anti-children.

  Title: Dodgers collaborate with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami on merchandise again. Here's how to get it
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 11:00:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article highlights how the collaboration between Takashi Murakami and the Dodgers, along with the MLB Tokyo Series, successfully captured public attention. The text states, "the overall success of the tokyo series collection delighted murakami" and "i was surprised by the overwhelming response." This suggests that the media coverage and marketing efforts surrounding the event effectively placed it on the public's agenda, leading to increased interest and demand.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions the merchandise hitting the secondary market for four times the purchase price. This suggests a potential imbalance between supply and demand, and raises the question: Was the limited availability of the merchandise intentional to drive up prices and create hype, and if so, what are the ethical implications of such a strategy?; Intriguing_angles: The article notes Murakami's surprise at the overwhelming response in Japan, stating, "honestly, i had thought baseball wasnt as major a sport in japan these days." This suggests a potential disconnect between the artist's perception and the reality of baseball's popularity in Japan. What other assumptions might be influencing the collaboration, and how might these assumptions affect its long-term success?

  Content: a month ago, dodgers gear festooned with colorful flowers in the unmistakable designs of acclaimed japanese artist takashi murakami sold out in minutes at a pop-up on fairfax avenue. a couple hundred angelenos lined up overnight to purchase gear, generating 40 million. the pop-up, called the mlb tokyo series collection, preceded the two-game, season-opening series in japan between the dodgers and chicago cubs, and items soon hit the secondary market for four times the purchase price. the merchandise was so popular that murakami and the dodgers responded by approximating the famous words of hall of fame cubs shortstop ernie banks lets play two! a new collection presented by complex and fanatics will be available april 28 during japanese heritage night at dodger stadium and the dodger clubhouse store, then can be purchased only online. murakami, 63, will throw out the ceremonial first pitch as he did before an exhibition between the dodgers and yomiuri giants at the tokyo dome on march 15. its been two months since i started practicing for the first pitch in tokyo, but given my age, its not so easy to pick up new skills, murakami said playfully in an interview with the times. still, compared to the first day when i couldnt throw the ball at all, ive improved significantly. my hope this time is to throw the ball without it bouncing. some of the dodgers merchandise created in collaboration with japanese artist takashi murakami is shown. complex murakami is unquestionably adept with a brush, a pen or a computer, creating iconic art that features manga, anime, cartoons and brightly colored anthropomorphic cherry blossoms, mushrooms and assorted flowers. he began delivering commissioned projects for luxury brands and celebrities 20 years ago, and a financial pinnacle came in 2008 when his provocative life-size figure my lonesome cowboy sold for 15.1 million at auction. since then murakami has integrated his art on louis vuitton handbags, a kanye west album cover, and the kid cudi collaboration kids see ghosts. he also had a solo exhibition in 2022 at the broad titled takashi murakami stepping on the tail of a rainbow that included sculpture, painting, wallpaper and immersive installations. now his attention has turned to baseball. the mlb tokyo series collection had his familiar colorful flora sprinkled across jerseys, bats, balls, hoodies, flip-flops and a shohei ohtani bobblehead. the surprise medium might have been collaborating with topps on baseball cards. since 2023, i have been creating trading cards and trading card games with my team, so i felt i approached this project with a good understanding of the context, murakami said. but when we filmed the unboxing event for the topps complex series and tokyo series on youtube, i recognized anew how profound the world of american sports trading cards is, which shook me with excitement. the overall success of the tokyo series collection delighted murakami, who said he remembers playing catch with his father as a child. honestly, i had thought baseball wasnt as major a sport in japan these days, so i was surprised by the overwhelming response, he said. i received messages from childhood friends and was approached by neighbors afterwards, which made me realize that baseball remains the beloved sport among the japanese public. the addition of japanese megastars ohtani, yoshinobu yamamoto and roki sasaki made collaborating with the dodgers a natural. the teams popularity in japan has never been greater. the dodgers are the team hideo nomo joined when he first played major league baseball, overcoming various obstacles, murakami said. his success had a significant impact on japanese players entering the majors, and his achievements are vivid in my memory. shohei ohtani joining the dodgers feels like a fateful story for japanese baseball, and im deeply moved by it. in that sense, i consider myself a dodgers fan. murakami added that he has felt comfortable in l.a. since his exhibition at the museum of contemporary art in 2007-2008. i believe my career as an artist in the contemporary art world took off in los angeles, he said. the moca exhibition, curated by paul schimmel, was pivotal in establishing my career in america. whenever i visit los angeles, i feel a strong connection, as if its my second hometown, with fans saying hello to me around the city. so im especially grateful for this new relationship with the dodgers in los angeles.

  Content: atlanta ap trump administration officials were out in force across the television networks sunday defending president donald trumps economic policies after another week of reeling markets that saw the republican administration reverse course on some of its steepest tariffs. trump, meanwhile, said on his social media platform that there ultimately will be no exemptions for his sweeping tariff agenda, disputing characterizations that he has granted tariff exceptions for certain electronics, including smart phones, whose production is concentrated in china. rather, trump said, those products are subject to the existing 20 fentanyl tariffs, and they are just moving to a different tariff bucket. white house advisers and cabinet members tried to project confidence and calm amid trumps on-again, off-again approach to tariffs on imported goods from around the world. but their explanations about the overall agenda, coupled with trumps latest statements, also reflected shifting narratives from a president who, as a candidate in 2024, promised an immediate economic boost and lower prices but now asks american businesses and consumers for patience. a week ago, trumps team stood by his promise to leave the impending tariffs in place without exceptions. they used their latest news show appearances to defend his move to ratchet back to a 10 universal tariff for most nations except china 145, while seeming to grant exemptions for certain electronics like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and semiconductor chips. here are the highlights of what trump lieutenants said last week vs. sunday there are varying answers on the purpose of the tariffs long before launching his first presidential campaign in 2015, trump bemoaned the offshoring of u.s. manufacturing. his promise is to reindustrialize the united states and eliminate trade deficits with other countries. last week commerce secretary howard lutnick, interviewed on cbs face the nation, played up national security. youve got to realize this is a national security issue, he said, raising the worst-case scenarios of what could happen if the u.s. were involved in a war. we dont make medicine in this country anymore. we dont make ships. we dont have enough steel and aluminum to fight a battle, right? he said. sunday lutnick stuck to that national security framing, but white house trade adviser peter navarro focused more on the import taxes being leverage in the bigger economic puzzle. the world cheats us. theyve been cheating us for decades, navarro said on nbcs meet the press. he cited practices such as dumping products at unfairly low prices, currency manipulation and barriers to u.s. auto and agricultural products entering foreign markets. navarro insisted the tariffs would yield broader bilateral trade deals to address all those issues. but he also relied on a separate justification when discussing china the illicit drug trade. china has killed over a million people with their fentanyl, he said. speaking before trumps truth social post disputing the notion of exemptions, lutnick alluded to that coming policy. theyre going to have a special focus-type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored, he told abcs this week. the status of negotiations with other nations, including china, remains fuzzy last week with the higher rates set to be collected beginning april 9, administration officials argued that other countries would rush to the negotiating table. ive heard that there are negotiations ongoing and that there are a number of offers, kevin hassett, director of the white house economic council, told abc. he claimed that more than 50 countries were reaching out, though he did not name any. sunday navarro named the united kingdom, the european union, india, japan, south korea, indonesia and israel as among the nations in active negotiations with u.s. trade representative jamieson greer, lutnick and other officials. greer said on cbs that his goal was to get meaningful deals before 90 days - the duration of trumps pause - and i think were going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks. talks with china have not begun, he said. we expect to have a conversation with them, he said, emphasizing it would be between trump and chinese president xi jinping. trump took an aggressive tone himself sunday in his social media post, saying we will not be held hostage by other countries, especially hostile trading nations like china, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the american people. navarro was not as specific about beijing. we have opened up our invitation to them, he said. lutnick characterized the outreach as soft entrees through intermediaries. pressed on whether there is any meaningful back and forth, navarro said, the president has a very good relationship with president xi. then he proceeded to criticize several chinas polices and trade practices. the pitches are different, but confidence is constant last week navarro was bullish even after u.s. and global trading markets suffered trillions of dollars in losses. the first rule, particularly for the smaller investors out there, you cant lose money unless you sell. and, right now, the smart strategy is not to panic, he said on fox news channels sunday morning futures. sunday navarros optimism did not waver despite another net-loss week for securities markets and rocky bond markets. so, this is unfolding exactly like we thought it would in a dominant scenario, he said. others confronted some of the more complex realities of trying to achieve trumps goal of restoring a bygone era of u.s. manufacturing. lutnick suggested the focus is on returning high-tech jobs, while sidestepping questions about lower-skilled manufacturing of goods such as shoes that could mean higher prices because of higher wages for u.s. workers. but some of that high-tech production is what trump has, for now, exempted from the tariffs that he and his advisers frame as leverage for forcing companies to open u.s. facilities. hassett did acknowledge widespread angst. the survey data has been showing that people are anxious about the changes a little bit, he said, before steering his answer to employment rates. the hard data, he said, has been really, really strong.

  Title: Trump goes with his gut and the world goes along for the ride
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-14 15:27:57)
  Content: washington ap after president donald trump reversed course on his tariffs and announced he would pursue trade negotiations, he had a simple explanation for how he would make decisions in the coming weeks. instinctively, more than anything else, he told reporters this past week. you almost cant take a pencil to paper, its really more of an instinct than anything else. it was the latest example of how trump loves to keep everyone on edge for his next move. trump has not only expansively flexed the powers of the presidency by declaring emergencies and shredding political norms, he has eschewed traditional deliberative procedures for making decisions. the result is that more of life around the country and the world is subject to the presidents desires, moods and grievances than ever before. we have a democratic leader who seems to have the authority to act as whimsically as a 19th century european autocrat, said tim naftali, a historian and senior research scholar at columbia university. he sneezes and everyone catches a cold. the white house rejects criticism that trump is overstepping his authority or improperly consolidating power. administration officials frequently emphasize that the republican president won a clear election victory and is now pursuing the agenda that he campaigned on. in this view, resisting his will, such as when courts block his executive orders, is the real threat to democracy. trust in president trump, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said friday while answering questions about economic policy. he knows what hes doing. the presidency has been accumulating power for years, long before trump ran for office, and it is not unusual for administrations to veer in various directions based on political and policy priorities. but trumps new term has been different in the early months, and he seems to recognize it. the second term is just more powerful, trump marveled recently. when i say do it, they do it. although international trade offers the most extensive example of trumps inclination to act unilaterally since he returned to office in january the same approach has been evident elsewhere. he installed himself as chair of the john f. kennedy center for the performing arts to overhaul programming at washingtons premier cultural institution. he issued an order to purge improper ideology from the smithsonian institutions network of museums. he punished law firms associated with his opponents. he directed the justice department to investigate former officials who crossed him during his first term. when trump decided to remove regulations on household water efficiency he wants more water flowing in showers his executive order said the normal public comment period is unnecessary because i am ordering the repeal. what the president ends up having is what he wants, which is everyones attention all of the time, naftali said. trumps ambitions stretch beyond the united states, such as his goal of annexing greenland. vice president jd vance visited the island last month to talk about its strategic location in the arctic, where russia and china want to expand their influence, but also its importance to trump himself. we cant just ignore the presidents desires, vance said. trump has spent decades trying to turn his impulses into reality, whether its skyscrapers in manhattan or casinos in atlantic city, new jersey. he once sued a journalist for allegedly underestimating his net worth. during a deposition, trump said it goes up and down with the markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings. a lawyer for the journalist appeared puzzled. you said your net worth goes up and down based upon your own feelings? trump said yes. i would say its my general attitude at the time that the question may be asked. he took a similar approach into the white house for his first term. while talking about the economy with the washington post, trump said my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody elses brain can ever tell me. leon panetta, who was white house chief of staff under democratic president bill clinton and later served in national security roles for democratic president barack obama, said there normally is a more deliberative process for critical issues. if you throw all of that out of the window and operate based on gut instincts, what youre doing is making every decision a huge gamble, panetta said. because you just havent done the homework to really understand all of the implications. when you roll dice, he added, sometimes its going to come up snake eyes. because trump does not have a clear process for making decisions, panetta said that means everybody has to kowtow to him because thats the only way youre going to have any impact. trump has seemed to enjoy that aspect of the ongoing controversy over tariffs. during a republican dinner this past week, he said foreign leaders were kissing my ass to talk him out of his trade agenda. the saga began on april 2 when trump declared that trade deficits when the u.s. buys more products from some countries than it sells represented a national emergency, enabling him to enact tariffs without congressional approval. the stock market collapsed and then the bond market began to slide. on wednesday, trump backed off his plans. although high taxes have been left in place on imports from china, many of the other targeted tariffs have been paused for 90 days to allow time for negotiations with individual countries. americans should trust in that process, said leavitt, the press secretary. scott lincicome, vice president of general economics at the conservative cato institute, expressed concern that the course of international trade was becoming dependent on the whims of a single dude in the oval office. lincicome said the white house timeline to reach trade deals was not credible given the complexity of the issues. a more likely scenario, he said, is that the resulting agreements will be nothing more than superficial nothingburgers and trump will declare a great victory and all this stuff settles down. peter navarro, trumps trade adviser, said in an interview with fox business network that theres a whole portion of our white house working day and night on negotiations. were going to run 90 deals in 90 days, he said. its possible.

  Title: Opinion: This isn’t immigration enforcement. It’s political theater. - The Salt Lake Tribune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-10 12:01:24)
  Content: federal law enforcement under president trump is engaged in dangerous political theater, with high-profile arrests of non-citizen students, workers and parents set up to score political points more than to protect national security. it is not impossible for the united states to have a humane immigration system focused on public safety that provides for the growth of the nation and local communities. ive seen those possibilities through my work in military intelligence, counterterrorism, homeland defense and cyberoperations and as the chief of staff at u.s. immigration customs and enforcement during the biden administration. border security and interior immigration are linked but separate challenges. in towns within the united states, there is an effective way to do interior immigration enforcement and protect our national security without undue emphasis on undocumented immigrants who do not have criminal convictions. right now, the government is burning thousands of federal law enforcement hours on operations that privilege political objectives over public safety, attacking constitutional protections like due process and free speech as they do. if this administration doesnt correct course, it will lock the country into a future of weaker enforcement, lowered trust in public safety officials and greater risk to americans collective safety. this is not the first administration to fail at this task. president barack obama leaned on broken enforcement policies, using deportation as a deterrent while unsuccessfully trying to reform the broader immigration enterprise. president trumps first administration implemented zero-tolerance policies that separated families, sought to end protections for children who arrived in this country as minors, prioritized draconian deterrence measures and relied on emergency public health restrictions, like title 42. the biden white house then continued to use emergency public health restrictions as a crutch to address a problem that needed a much more expansive solution. as each successive administration relied more on executive power to manage the system, congress did not pass structured, long-term immigration reform. but this moment is worse. the new trump white house is finding ever more cruel, even brutal, methods to publicly target some of the most vulnerable people in this country. while americans are distracted by sensational videos of anti-migrant enforcement actions from the trump administration on social media, the real threats grow. the homeland security secretary, kristi noem, recently announced that federal agents arrested roughly 20,000 undocumented people across the country in february. that doesnt mean 20,000 national security threats were removed from the united states. on average, the united states can deport only about 7,000 to 9,000 people monthly by plane, and detention centers were at maximum capacity. so what happened to the 13,000 other migrants who were arrested? the only rational law enforcement step would be to process and then release them. that means law enforcements time, energy and focus were wasted on a political stunt. and real people suffered. every ice agent dispatched to detain a noncriminal farmworker, construction laborer or college student many, if not most, of whom have legal standing to work and study in our communities is an ice agent not investigating fentanyl networks, cyberattacks, human trafficking or transnational gangs. those are the actual bad actors who threaten american safety and sovereignty. last month, the department of homeland security removed a maryland father to el salvador that it had no ground to deport, and despite well-documented threats against his life from local gangs. ice arrested and continues to hold in detention a tufts university student with no criminal record another case that lacks any public safety rationale. these cases send a message that law enforcement is a prop, not a protector. the machinery of federal law enforcement is powerful. thats what makes it so dangerous when misused by political opportunists. ice and u.s. customs and border protection have greater authority than most americans realize. they can detain people without a warrant, conduct searches without probable cause and deport people without criminal charges. these powers demand discipline, not spectacle. they exist to respond urgently to serious threats, prevent cross-border crime and detain individuals who pose risks when time or circumstances dont allow for traditional criminal justice processes. they do not exist to target migrant grandmothers from guatemala, unaccompanied children fleeing gang violence, haitian families seeking asylum from political collapse, palestinian and indian students who attended u.s. universities under lawful visas, or mexican and salvadoran families working and raising u.s. citizen children while trapped in immigration backlogs. over the past two decades, the united states has invested heavily in a sophisticated vetting infrastructure. it can flag threats based on identities, travel histories and behavioral patterns. its built to catch real bad actors before they can do harm. but instead of using its tools to protect children from abuse or disrupt transnational money laundering operations, they are being used to track down individuals with no criminal convictions, people who are providing our nation the benefits of their hope and hard work. when ice and c.b.p. are used in this manner, their mission is compromised. career agents are sidelined. morale drops. recruitment suffers. when communities see federal law enforcement used to punish rather than to protect, they stop cooperating. law enforcement loses tips, and witnesses. local partners hesitate to share information. thats how dangerous actors slip through. the real bad actors are getting smarter and faster. mexican cartels use tunnels and ultralight aircraft to move narcotics. cybercriminals attack hospitals and rural infrastructure. international smuggling operations launder profits through cryptocurrency. that means the best solution for public safety is not mass deportations its giving undocumented immigrants who have been in the united states for a long time the opportunity to come forward, pay a fine and gain legal status. this country needs law enforcement that goes after genuine threats, not just easy targets, and immigration enforcement that reflects who we are a nation built by immigrants and secured by law. law enforcement agents know how to do it. they built the tools. but if the current administration keeps misusing them, the people who intend to harm us will succeed. jason p. houser is a former ice chief of staff, department of homeland security counterterrorism official, afghanistan combat veteran, and u.s. cyber command liaison to israel and europe. this article originally appeared in the new york times. get the latest news by subscribing to our top stories newsletter. enter your email below to receive more stories like these right to your inbox.

  Title: Analysis-Trump Uses Power Against Foes Unlike Any Other Modern US President
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-02 05:05:38)
  Content: by james oliphant and jeff mason washington reuters -in just 10 weeks in office, donald trump has imposed his will on perceived adversaries in business, politics, the media and allied nations by leveraging power in ways no other modern u.s. president has tried. his administration has sought the arrest and deportation of student protesters, withheld federal funds from colleges, ostracized law firms tied to his political opponents, threatened judges and tried to pressure journalists. at the same time trump has downsized the federal government dramatically and purged it of workers who could stand in his way. central to this effort has been trumps use of policy-making executive orders to target opponents as never before. he has been unafraid to employ lawsuits, public threats and the power of the federal purse to bring institutions to heel. what unites all these efforts is trumps desire to shut down every potential source of resistance to the maga agenda and to his personal power, said peter shane, a law professor at new york university. some targets have rushed to placate the president, a few have fought back and many are still trying to figure out how to respond. many of trumps actions are being challenged in courts, where some judges have tried to slow him down. the stunning speed and breadth of the republican presidents actions have caught democrats, public-service unions, ceos and the legal profession off guard. trumps supporters say he is simply using the full reach of his presidency to achieve the goals he set as a candidate. hes laid out these broad battle lines, whether its with people that he thinks have tried to ruin him personally, whether its with people he thinks have tried to ruin western civilization, said republican strategist scott jennings, a longtime adviser to senator mitch mcconnell. everything he said he was going to do on the campaign, hes doing. trumps aims are not just political. his actions show he wants to reorder american society with an all-powerful executive at the top, where financial, political and cultural institutions carry his stamp and where opposition is either co-opted or curtailed. with a compliant congress controlled by his party and a u.s. supreme court dominated by conservatives, trump is operating with fewer checks on his power than any of his modern-day predecessors. trump has attempted to subdue and cajole his adversaries on an almost-daily basis, backed by the fearsome might of the law enforcement and regulatory agencies at his command. he has often succeeded. he managed to wring concessions out of several of his targets, including storied columbia university, powerful law firms and corporate titans such as meta and disney. all of them settled with the white house rather than endure the pressure, surrendering some independence and setting what some view as damaging precedents. others are taking preemptive measures to avoid trumps wrath. more than 20 of americas largest companies and financial firms, including goldman sachs, google and pepsico, have rolled back diversity programs that had drawn trumps ire. three law firms cut deals with the administration rather than risk losing their lawyers security clearances, access to government buildings and perhaps, as a result, clients, while three others targeted by trumps executive orders sued in response. trumps orders have also been his vehicle to remake the government, deport alleged venezuelan gang members with little due process and levy tariffs against u.s. trading partners. he has sued u.s. media corporations and silenced the voice of america, taken control of the kennedy center, a leading arts facility, and sought to put curbs on the smithsonian institution, whose mission is to chronicle history. his administration has detained student protesters whose political views it says are a threat to the country. trump has pushed a mineral-rights deal on ukraines leadership with the veiled threat of ending u.s. support for kyiv in the russian war in ukraine. he has threatened nato ally denmark to try to wrest control of greenland, spoken of annexing canada and threatened to take the panama canal back from its home country. tailored strikes mark zaid, a washington lawyer who represents whistleblowers against the federal government and who himself had his security clearance stripped away by trump, said the presidents conduct is like nothing he has seen in his 30-year career. executive orders have never been designed to specifically target individuals nor non-government actors for purposes of retaliation or retribution, zaid said. the white house and trumps allies deny the president is acting out of revenge. a white house spokesman said more traditional approaches have failed to bring meaningful change. unconventional is precisely what the american people voted for when they elected president trump, white house spokesman harrison fields said. the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy. in his first term from 2017-2021, trump was hamstrung by a variety of factors a federal probe into russian interference, his aides lack of experience and greater democratic opposition in congress. with those roadblocks gone, an emboldened trump has demonstrated at the start of his second term that he has learned how to use the resources available to him more fully to get what he wants. he really does know how to pull the levers of power this time, more so than last time, said rina shah, a republican strategist. claire wofford, a political science professor at the college of charleston, said trump has used executive orders not only to push forward a policy agenda, but also to send messages to his political base, as in his attempt to scale back birthright citizenship, and to test the limits of his power, as with his invocation of an 18th-century law to designate some migrants as alien enemies. what strikes me most at this point is how strategic trump is - but in new ways, wofford said. funding and litigation in cases such as with columbia university, trump has used the federal purse as a cudgel, concluding his targets have financial interests that make them vulnerable to coercion. in other cases, he has used the courts, forcing companies such as disney and meta into favorable settlements after trump filed lawsuits against them. cbs news, another trump lawsuit target, is under pressure to settle its suit because its parent, paramount, is eager to have its proposed merger with skydance media approved by trump administration regulators. but not every institution has bent the knee. many of trumps actions, particularly those regarding his cuts in government, remain tied up in federal court. in the last two weeks alone, judges have ruled against trump in matters challenging his deportation policies, attacks against law firms and plans to eliminate government agencies. in response, trump and his allies have called for judges who rule against the administration to be impeached and drawn a rare rebuke from chief justice john roberts. walter olson, a senior fellow at the libertarian cato institute, said trumps attacks on law firms and judges are without precedent and are reminiscent of other nations with authoritarian regimes. clipping the wings of law firms and the courts, olson said, is the behavior of an autocrat. reporting by james oliphant and jeff masonediting by colleen jenkins and howard goller

  Title: Trump's agenda grapples with political and economic reality - BBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-05 00:02:40)
  Content: donald trump, in announcing his sweeping new tariffs on us imports on wednesday, promised that the history books would record 2 april as americas liberation day. after two days of stock market turmoil, however, this may also be remembered as the week the presidents second-term agenda ran headfirst into economic - and political - reality. us stocks have been in a tailspin since trump unveiled his tariffs at wednesday afternoons white house rose garden event, with signs that americas trading partners - canada, the european union and china, most notably - are not backing away from a fight. meanwhile, other presidential efforts, on foreign policy and immigration, and at the ballot box - have faced notable setbacks in recent days. the white house on thursday felt a bit like a building battening down for a coming storm. the four big posters showing americas reciprocal tariffs on a long list of countries were on prominent display in the press briefing room, but administration officials available to respond to media questions were few and far between. out on pennsylvania avenue, workers unloaded pallets of metal fencing, which will ring the white house grounds in preparation for what officials anticipate to be a large anti-trump demonstration at the nearby washington monument on saturday. the first lady announced that a white house garden tour event that had been scheduled for that day was postponed because of security concerns. even the normally loquacious president stopped only briefly to talk with the crush of reporters on his way to board the marine one helicopter on the first leg of his journey to florida. i said this would be exactly the way it is, he declared when asked about the days stock market turmoil. the markets - and america as a whole - would soon boom, he said. the president, it seems, is willing to wait out the tempest created by his tariff plan. he appears confident that his economic vision of a rebuilt, job-rich american manufacturing sector protected from foreign competition - a vision he has closely held for decades - will ultimately be proven right. the trump agendas close encounter with cold, hard reality wasnt limited to trade this week, however. his two top foreign policy priorities - ending the wars in gaza and ukraine - both appear mired in the kind of messy details and conflicting agendas that often obstruct lasting peace. israel has once again moved into gaza and escalated a bombing campaign that is generating reports of widespread civilian casualties. the ceasefire that trump touted in the days before he took office appears to be in tatters. russia, meanwhile, continues to pile new conditions on to negotiations for a full ceasefire with ukraine, which is an indication that the nation may be buying time to allow its ground forces to take more territory. if i think theyre tapping us along, i will not be happy about it, trump said of russia. but he added that he still believes president vladimir putin wants to make a deal. evidence so far indicates the contrary, according to jake sullivan, who was president joe bidens national security adviser. in an interview with the bbc, he accused trump of handing russia most of its demands, though he acknowledged it was still early in the process and things could yet change. so the current dynamic in these negotiations a is not in fact producing russian willingness to reach a fair and just compromise, but b is actually stimulating a view in moscow that if they just keep holding out, theyre just going to keep getting concessions from the united states. and so far that is what has happened. even trumps deportation and immigration enforcement efforts, which still have high public support, have been at least partially derailed by legal challenges. while his administration has successfully completed several flights transferring alleged tren de aragua venezuelan gang members to an el salvadoran high-security prison, the judge presiding over a case challenging those deportations said on thursday there was a fair likelihood officials had violated his court order to turn the flights around. other court challenges - to trumps suspension of political asylum processing and refugee resettlement, his attempt to end birthright citizenship and his revocation of temporary protected status for about 350,000 venezuelans - are currently working their way through the us legal system. at some point, the us supreme court is expected to weigh in on many of these disputes. this week also marked the biggest round of elections since trumps november 2024 victory, as voters headed to the polls in wisconsin to elect a state judge and in two florida special elections for seats in the house of representatives. while the republican candidates in florida prevailed, their winning margins were about 15, which is about half of what trump posted in those congressional districts in november. in wisconsin, a key political battleground state, the democratic-backed candidate won. democrats were able to maintain the liberal majority on the court despite the tens of millions of dollars spent by conservative groups, including by tech billionaire elon musk, who campaigned there in person. taken as a whole the results suggest that democrats are doing well in hotly contested races and may be making inroads even in reliably conservative areas - in part by campaigning against musk and his efforts to massively cut federal programmes and staff. that could be an indication that the party will have the political wind at their backs in state elections this november and the midterm congressional elections next year. the stock market tumult, and those ballot-box results, may be behind a few scattered signs of dissent within republican ranks. ted cruz, an arch-conservative senator from texas, said on his podcast on friday that trumps tariffs could hurt jobs and could hurt america - particularly if other nations retaliate, as china has already done. if were in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now, with massive american tariffs, and massive tariffs on american goods in every other country on earth, that is a terrible outcome, he continued. on wednesday night in the us senate, four republicans joined with democrats to support rescinding the emergency declaration that justifies trumps earlier canada tariffs. and on thursday, republican senator chuck grassley of iowa joined with democrat maria cantwell of washington to back a measure that would require congress to directly approve tariffs that stay in effect longer than 60 days. republicans by and large have been sticking with the president. they seem unwilling, or unable, to sway trump from his current course on tariffs and government cuts and appear fearful of the political consequences of breaking with the man who has a vise-like grip on the party. but if the current economic shock becomes a long-term hardship, and if government programme cuts translate into tangible disruptions in popular services or if trumps standing in opinion polls continues to sag, members of his own party may begin eyeing the exit signs for the first time in years. and that would bring an unceremonious end to some of trumps most ambitious efforts. trump, no longer worried about standing before voters, may feel liberated from the immediate political consequences of his actions - but reality has a way of asserting itself in the end.

  Title: The New Baby Boom: How the White House is looking to jumpstart the nation’s birth rate
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-21 22:04:19)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article demonstrates how the Trump administration and affiliated organizations like the Heritage Foundation are actively trying to frame the declining birth rate as a critical issue demanding immediate policy interventions. The repeated mentions of the birth rate decline, coupled with proposed solutions like baby bonuses and changes to federal programs, serve to elevate this issue in the public consciousness. This is evident in the statement: 'the trump administration is reportedly fielding ideas for how to increase the declining u.s. birth rate.' By consistently highlighting this issue and associating it with specific solutions, the administration aims to shape public discourse and policy agendas, potentially influencing public opinion and legislative action.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article can be interpreted through the lens of Realism, particularly concerning national power and security. The concern over declining birth rates is framed as a potential threat to the nation's economic and social stability, as stated: 'A shrinking population could struggle to invigorate the economy and strain the social safety net, as the population skews increasingly older.' This aligns with Realist thought, which emphasizes the importance of a strong population base for maintaining national power and competitiveness. The proposed interventions, such as baby bonuses and prioritizing families in federal programs, can be seen as attempts to bolster the nation's demographic strength, thereby enhancing its long-term security and influence in the international arena.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the Trump administration's efforts to increase the birth rate while simultaneously cutting funding to health and human services, including those that monitor fertilization issues. This contradiction is evident in the statement: 'transportation secretary sean duffy has directed his agency to give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average...at the same time, the administrations push to slash federal spending and radically shrink the federal workforce has cut back teams that monitor fertilization issues.' This raises questions about the sincerity and effectiveness of the administration's stated goals. Could these cuts undermine the very initiatives aimed at increasing birth rates? What are the potential political motivations behind prioritizing certain communities while simultaneously reducing overall support for reproductive health?; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Elon Musk's interest in increasing the birth rate, linking it to his broader ambition of colonizing Mars and populating it with individuals of 'high intelligence.' This connection, while seemingly futuristic, raises ethical and ideological questions about the motivations behind promoting higher birth rates. The article states: 'he reportedly wants to populate the world with more babies of high intelligence as part of a wider effort to get humans to mars.' What are the potential implications of framing pro-natalist policies within the context of eugenics or selective breeding? How might this influence public perception and acceptance of such policies?

administration is reportedly fielding ideas for how to increase the declining u.s. birth rate, a longtime priority of white house figures like vice president jd vance and elon musk. since 1990 the u.s. total fertility rate has declined from 2.1 births per woman enough to fully replace the current population to 1.62 births per woman in 2023, below the replacement level, according to a march report from the u.s. centers for disease control, part of a larger decline in birth rates in wealthy peer countries. experts point to a variety of causes for the trend, including the increased prevalence of dual-income households, cost of living issues, and changing social mores. while the u.s. birth rate rests between comparable nations higher than that of japan, italy, and china, on par with the uk and australia, but lower than south korea the declining figure is a subject of concern for many. a shrinking population could struggle to invigorate the economy and strain the social safety net, as the population skews increasingly older. groups have pitched the administration on a variety of ideas, including a 5,000 baby bonus for new mothers, expanded child tax credits, funding menstrual cycle education, and reserving space in federal programs like fulbright fellowships for people who are married or have children, according to the new york times. the motivations behind such ideas are numerous, though many align with the rights emphasis on the family as the building block of society. project 2025, the conservative policy blueprint thats informed many administration ideas, opens with a chapter on how to restore the family as the centerpiece of american life, urging traditional roles for parents. trump has promised to champion new families and in vitro fertilization getty images the convener of project 2025, the heritage foundation, is reportedly involved in the birth boom discussion with the administration, urging ideas like researching root health and environmental causes of infertility, while expressing reticence over in vitro fertilization, a core cause of the administration. others at the foundation have pushed for natural fertility education on how to prevent unwanted pregnancy without using birth control by using menstrual cycle tracking. such ideas have found a willing ear in the administration, which has said it will release a blueprint for how to increase access to in vitro fertilization next month. trump has vowed to be the fertilization president, while vance has made a point of appearing at public events with his three children, and once called declining birth rates a civilizational crisis driven by cat lades on the childless left. musk frequently posts about the declining birth rate, and has claimed, the childless have little stake in the future. he is the father of at least 14 children though at least one of them has publicly criticized him for being a very critical, and absentee parent. he reportedly wants to populate the world with more babies of high intelligence as part of a wider effort to get humans to mars, according to recent reporting from the wall street journal. jd vance responds to criticism of childless cat lady remarks the push could provide a rare window for bipartisan cooperation on womens and health issues, though it faces considerable political challenges, including a divided congress, a conservative movement split over issues like in vitro fertilization, and liberals wary of certain wings of the wider natalist movement, which includes everyone from religious conservatives to opponents of same-sex couples and outright eugenicists. in practice, the administrations actions have cut a variety of directions on the birth issue. transportation secretary sean duffy has directed his agency to give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average, according to a memo obtained earlier this year. at the same time, the administrations push to slash federal spending and radically shrink the federal workforce has cut back teams that monitor fertilization issues and analyze health data, while laying off thousands from the department of health and human services and attempting to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in health research funding. critics aslo complain that while the trump administration and its supporters make abortion increasingly difficult, little is being done to help families or single mothers cope with child-raising amid poverty and a paycheck-to-paycheck existence. with cost of living a major factor in many couples decisions on whether to start a family, the continued economic chaos of the trump tariffs could also play a role. prior to the second trump term, justices appointed by the republican in his first outing were the key votes in the 2022 supreme court ruling overturning the constitutional right to an abortion, a landmark turn in u.s. policy that health experts say has caused expecting mothers to face health risks and death in states that have since moved to restrict forms of reproductive healthcare. in addition, the dangerous crackdown on doctors for example caring for women suffering miscarriages, which end as many as 20 percent of pregnancies 50 percent for women over 45, has convinced masses of doctors to choose less risky specialties or flee states with threatening conditions for obstetricians and gynecologists, leaving women scrambling to find reproductive health physicians.

  Title: How Trump Waged War on His Perceived Foes in First 100 Days
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-22 10:06:09)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article illustrates a Realist perspective on international relations applied domestically. Trump's actions, such as targeting perceived enemies and prioritizing national interests as he defines them, reflect a power-centric approach. The text states, "trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies." This demonstrates a focus on consolidating and exercising power, a core tenet of Realism.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Trump's use of executive orders to target perceived enemies, stating, "trump has made particular use of executive orders...to target perceived foes." This is intriguing because executive orders are typically used to direct policy priorities. Could this suggest a blurring of the lines between policy and personal vendettas, potentially undermining the legitimacy of the executive branch?

  Content: by joseph ax reuters -hours after swearing an oath to defend the u.s. constitution on january 20, president donald trump signed an executive order directing his attorney general to scour the justice department and other agencies for evidence of political weaponization. the same day, pentagon staff took down a portrait of mark milley, a trump critic who as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been the highest-ranking military officer during trumps first term. that evening, trump stripped his former national security adviser, john bolton - who wrote a memoir critical of trump - of the protective secret service detail he had been given after the justice department said iran had threatened boltons life. in his first 100 days, trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies. these include former intelligence officials who investigated alleged russian ties to his 2016 election campaign and major law firms as well as former biden administration members and prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against him while he was out of power. trumps actions served notice that his campaign promise of political retribution was anything but rhetorical, after he repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate. but the speed and sweep of his actions have caught many by surprise, with even the smallest slights drawing reprisals. the republican president has used the machinery of the state and the power of the presidency to go after people and institutions that have aggrieved him in more expansive ways than any of his predecessors, historians said. its not unusual for presidents to have enemies, said jeremi suri, a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin. what is unusual is for the president to use the entirety of the federal government, not simply to exclude someone, but to directly punish them. trump has made particular use of executive orders - typically used by presidents to direct policy priorities - to target perceived foes by stripping them of security clearances, blocking them from government buildings or directing agencies to probe them for wrongdoing. he has launched multiple federal probes into maine after a verbal spat with the states governor, reached deep into the traditionally independent justice department to fire those he views as disloyal, pulled protective security details from his critics and ordered investigations into former officials who challenged his false claims that his 2020 election loss was rigged. on his first day in office, he removed clearances for 50 former national security officials who had signed a letter suggesting russia was behind a story about salacious material found on a laptop belonging to president joe bidens son hunter. no evidence of russian involvement has emerged. he has also taken away clearances for all three democrats who ran against him in presidential contests biden, hillary clinton and kamala harris. trump has focused much of his attention on the criminal justice system after claiming during his 2024 presidential campaign that his four indictments were motivated by politics. then-president joe bidens administration denied the accusations. in trumps first 100 days, his justice department has fired or demoted dozens of officials, prosecutors and fbi agents, including rank-and-file employees who worked on investigations into trump and the january 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob of trump supporters. in a speech at the justice departments headquarters in february, trump denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him with illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. traditional presidencies have failed to bring meaningful change to the ways of washington, and the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy, a white house spokesman, harrison fields, said in response to questions about trumps retribution efforts and whether they represent an abuse of power. utilizing every tool afforded by the constitution, the trump administration is prioritizing efficiency eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and fulfilling every campaign promise. the ferocity and the scope during his first term, trumps instincts for revenge were sometimes thwarted by his own appointees, many of whom were experienced government hands or establishment republicans. by contrast, trump has filled his second-term administration with steadfast loyalists more likely to back his directives than caution against them. meanwhile, the republican majority in congress has shown little interest in opposing his actions. trump has taken steps as well to eliminate internal watchdogs who might seek to constrain him, purging inspectors general and firing government ethics officials. all administrations, particularly when you see a switch from one party to another, seek to control the executive branch, said historian timothy naftali, the former director of the richard nixon presidential library and museum. its the ferocity and the scope of what hes done that makes it unprecedented. the republican nixon famously had a list of enemies, but he plotted against them in secret. his most aggressive ideas, such as using the tax-collecting internal revenue service to audit his foes, were often blocked by his own officials. other presidents have used their power to penalize rivals in more muted ways, suri said. democrat lyndon johnson sought to discredit his political rival, robert kennedy, in the news media, and republican george w. bush banned brent scowcroft, a former national security adviser, from the white house after scowcroft wrote a column opposing the iraq war. thats often how presidents use their power to go after enemies they keep them out of their administration and spread rumors about them, suri said. only the beginning trump has frequently intertwined his personal animus against political opponents with his administrations ideological and policy objectives. in february, trump digressed from remarks during a white house meeting with governors to address maine governor janet mills, warning her to comply with an order banning transgender athletes. see you in court, mills, a democrat, replied defiantly. within a day, three separate federal departments had initiated inquiries into whether the state was violating civil rights law, imperiling millions of dollars in federal funding. the justice department sent mills a letter telling her maine was on notice while trump demanded a full-throated apology before the case can be settled. in early april, trumps agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, wrote mills to confirm that some school funding had been frozen. this is only the beginning, rollins warned her. nine days later, the education department said it was taking steps to cut off all federal school funding to the state, and last week attorney general pam bondi announced the justice department had sued maine in federal court. in recent weeks, trump has attacked law firms that once employed attorneys he views as enemies, arguing they undermined the judicial process by doing so. in february, he suspended security clearances for attorneys at the law firm covington burling who had represented smith, the former special counsel investigating him, and sought to cancel any government work the firm had. making little effort to hide his primary motivation, trump suggested sending the pen he used to sign the order to smith as a souvenir. trump has signed executive orders targeting five other law firms, in each case indicating that revenge was an essential factor. his order punishing wilmerhale, for instance, noted that it once employed robert mueller, who investigated whether trumps 2016 campaign had improper connections with russia. nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work on mutually agreed projects backed by the administration. in some cases, trump simply appears determined to get even with former members of his 2017-2021 administration who irked him. this month, the president ordered the justice department to investigate christopher krebs, his former cybersecurity chief who disputed trumps false claims about election fraud in 2020, and miles taylor, a former homeland security official who anonymously wrote a 2019 book critical of trump. signing the executive order targeting the two former officials, trump called taylor a traitor. i think hes guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth, but well find out, he said. dissent isnt unlawful, taylor responded on x. it certainly isnt treasonous. reporting by joseph ax editing by ross colvin and howard goller 2025 thomson reuters.

  Title: Trump announces huge new tariffs to promote US manufacturing, risking inflation and trade wars
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 20:57:51)
  Content: by josh boak associated press washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the new tariffs, coming on what trump has named liberation day, are a bid to boost u.s. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he says are years of unfair trade practices. but by most economists assessments, the move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and upend decades-old alliances. the white house is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble. april 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern american history, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said tuesday. she said the new tariffs would take effect immediately. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. based on the possibility of broad 20 tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. because trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. leavitt is among three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the associated press on first and fifth amendment grounds. the ap says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. the white house says the ap is not following an executive order to refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america. associated press writers mike householder in oldcastle, ontario, sylvie corbet in paris and lisa mascaro contributed to this report.

  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article demonstrates how Trump actively shapes the public's perception by prioritizing certain narratives (e.g., 'political weaponization,' 'lies and abuses') and repeatedly emphasizing them. The text states Trump 'repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate' and 'denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him.' This constant reinforcement influences which issues voters deem important, potentially overshadowing other concerns.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the speed and scope of Trump's actions, noting that 'even the smallest slights drawing reprisals.' This suggests a potential underlying mechanism of personal vendettas driving policy decisions, raising questions about the stability and predictability of the administration's actions. What are the long-term consequences of such personalized governance?; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work.' This raises questions about the ethical implications of such arrangements and whether they constitute a form of extortion or coercion.

  Content: in a normal nation governed by the rule of law not donald trumps america, that is the governments mistaken deportation of a maryland father to a salvadoran gulag, in violation of a federal immigration judges 2019 order, might have been easily resolved. lo! just four days after the supreme court last thursday unanimously ordered the government to facilitate kilmar abrego garcias release back to the united states, el salvadors president nayib bukele was due in the oval office. bukele could have simply given the sheet-metal worker a lift back home to his wife and three children, all u.s. citizens, as part of the salvadoran entourage. for the record an earlier version of this article said president trump repeated his wishes to send citizen criminals to foreign prisons on fox news. it was during a fox noticias interview. thats not what happened on monday, of course. the casually clad bukele, self-described worlds coolest dictator, instead arrived with just the miami club promoters clothes on his back, as jon stewart quipped . then we saw the sorry spectacle of two strongmen presidents, trump and bukele, side by side in the oval office declaring themselves powerless to restore abrego garcias freedom. they smiled smugly, both in on the joke. besides, they claimed without evidence, hes a terrorist. voices calmes what hannah arendt saw in hitlers germany, we can see in trumps america political theorist hannah arendt came of age in germany as hitler came to power. her life and writings have a chilling resonance for americans today. in truth, abrego garcia and hundreds of other men were sent to el salvadors own hotel california, the terrorism confinement center, without due process charges, hearings, evidence, juries or judges. the administration called them the worst of the worst, though several media investigations found that few of the deportees, including abrego garcia, had criminal records other than immigration law infractions, and fewer yet had ties to gangs that trump has designated as terrorist groups. abrego garcias case is especially egregious. team trump admitted in court that he shouldnt have been shipped to el salvador, the one country that the federal order in 2019 said he must not be sent to, given the clear probability of future persecution. in fact , that federal immigration judge found, abrego garcia and his family were gang victims, repeatedly extorted under threat of death in el salvador. the first trump administration didnt appeal that 2019 order, just as the second hasnt. no wonder then that another judge, u.s. dist. court judge paula xinis, ordered the government to report daily on abrego garcias well-being and its attempts to return him, so far to no avail. nothing has been done. nothing, she protested tuesday, before ordering an extraordinary two-week inquiry into the administrations stunning defiance. meanwhile, the administration said in a court filing that if somehow abrego garcia did return, it would detain and deport him again. voices calmes making america a colonizer again the trump administration is trying to force a deal on ukraine and president volodymyr zelensky that would make the imperialists of the past blush. as bad as all this is, the trump-bukele bro-fest in the oval office all but confirmed that there is worse to come. the two men joked joked first in private we know thanks to bukeles post of the video and then openly to reporters that el salvador should build more megaprisons to house undesirable u.s. citizens homegrowns, trump said a couple of times, so pleased by his branding. you gotta build about five more places, he told bukele, yeah, the next phase, bukele agreed. aides cracked up. despite the yucks, trump was serious hes said before that hed love to ship citizen criminals to foreign jails. and he repeated his wishes on tuesday on fox noticias. such citizen deportations would violate another supreme court decision , from 1936, not to mention basic expectations of american justice. trump is halfway to making america a police state was the headline in the financial times the next morning. the only debatable word there is halfway. of the other two supposedly co-equal branches of government, trump has cowed congress and now is openly defying federal courts, including the supreme one. this is confirmation of a constitutional crisis , the likes of which the nation has never seen, except in other lands . more evidence on wednesday, another federal district judge, james e. boasberg, ruled that probable cause exists to find the government in criminal contempt for its willful disregard of his march order that it return the planes ferrying migrants to el salvador. voices calmes the united states careens toward a constitutional crisis what should the american people believe - trumps denials that hes defying court orders or the evidence that can be seen and heard? mondays performance in the oval office was the most chilling since trump and vice president jd vance ganged up on ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky on feb. 28. and now the offices garish new bling all the gold ornaments, wall medallions, cherubs, frames and end tables is a metaphor for trumps desecration of that sanctum. trumps amen choir of aides, including atty. gen. pam bondi and secretary of state marco rubio , piled on with further lies about abrego garcia. for instance the whopper from the execrable stephen miller, white house deputy chief of staff, that the supreme court had ruled 9-to-0 in the administrations favor, which conservative legal authority ed whelan quickly lambasted on x as an outrageous misrepresentation. talk about gaslighting. the supreme court said this about the lower federal courts order to return abrego garcia it properly requires the government to facilitate abrego garcias release from custody in el salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to el salvador. that seems clear enough to just about anyone not on trumps payroll, however cautiously worded the justices two-page order was. and yet, with trump dug in and seemingly enjoying the controversy the better to distract from his calamitous trade war it is hard to see how abrego garcia will be returned anytime soon. supreme court expert and pundit jeffrey toobin was blunt i dont think hes coming back, basically ever, he said on cnn . democrats, laser-focused on criticizing trump about the economy and skittish about immigration issues where he enjoys more support, are finally rousing to the constitutional crisis. maryland sen. chris van hollen landed in el salvador on wednesday, and others, including rep. robert garcia of long beach, also plan trips. but the ultimate pressure must come from the voters, like those who assailed republican sen. chuck grassley at a town hall in iowa this week. when grassley insisted he wouldnt help abrego garcia because thats not a power of congress, the attendees guffawed. they know better. jackiekcalmes

  Title: WALL AGAINST WORLD...
  Source: english.elpais.com (2025-04-02 22:07:36)
  Content: white house press secretary karoline leavitt during a news conference at the white house on tuesday. evan vucci ap tariffs are a tax on your grocery bill, announced billboards paid for by the government of canada on the streets of washington this week. meanwhile, television stations are broadcasting messages by toyota in which the japanese company emphasizes how american it is. the skirmishes have already begun, but the official declaration of trade war is expected this wednesday in the white house rose garden, in a solemn ceremony for what the u.s. president pompously calls liberation day. donald trump will erect a wall against imports with tariffs that aim to exceed 20 on average, although the final details have not been revealed. trump had already said at a rally that november 5, the day of the presidential election, would be liberation day. then, on his inauguration day, he proclaimed that for the american people, january 20, 2025, is liberation day. so this is at least the third liberation day in six months. as on the previous two occasions, the world is watching washington with bated breath. the president has promised to impose what he inaccurately calls reciprocal tariffs this wednesday. in theory, it is to punish countries that impose higher tariffs on the u.s. than those the u.s. imposes on them. in practice, trump is merely targeting countries that sell more to the u.s. than they buy from it. the last time washington embarked on a relatively comparable wave of protectionism was almost a century ago, with the smoot-hawley tariffs of 1930, and the result was disastrous. the trade war contributed to the great depression, and widespread tariffs were discredited. trump points even further back, to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as an example of a period when the u.s. economy grew strongly despite high tariffs. economists note that the country currently practicing an import-substitution trade policy most similar to the one trump appears to advocate is india. the republican president aims to turn tariffs into a permanent and significant source of revenue and to boost domestic production by penalizing foreign production. the two objectives are somewhat incompatible for there to be a lot of revenue, there must continue to be a lot of imports, and if there are a lot of imports, it will be because they havent been replaced with domestic production. the squaring of this circle is completed by those who claim that the exchange rate adjustment will keep products from becoming more expensive for americans but, in that case, it would not incentivize import substitution. for now, trumps announcements and measures have weakened the u.s. economy. growth prospects have deteriorated, increasing the risk of a recession, while inflation expectations have soared, complicating the federal reserves roadmap. in 2019, during trumps much smaller first trade war, the federal reserve concluded that the impact of uncertainty on slowing investment and hiring was greater than the direct effect of tariffs. this time, uncertainty is greater, given the presidents erratic behavior and the chaotic implementation of his measures. workers pack avocados for export in peribán, mexico. ivan arias reuters the trade war will hamper global growth, with almost guaranteed recessions for mexico and canada and, at the very least, stagnation in the european union. the markets have felt the blow early. investors have taken refuge in gold. wednesdays announcements will be made starting at 400 p.m. local time in washington, after the close of trading on wall street. the trade war is about moving from a rules-based global trading system to one built on deals. the problem is that trump doesnt respect the agreements he signs. during his first term, he negotiated the u.s.-mexico-canada agreement usmca, which he praised without hesitation, but which he has now ruthlessly scuttled. the white house has been discussing until the last minute the details of what it will announce this wednesday. there are no objective criteria for penalizing imports from one country or another. the decision ultimately stems from the whim of trump, a president who has embarked on an authoritarian drift, governing by executive decree beyond his constitutional powers. in recent days, trump has said he will be lenient with his tariffs, but the u.s. president is accustomed to living with constant lies. one of his top advisors on the matter, peter navarro, stated over the weekend that the government expects to raise 600 billion annually from tariffs. considering that u.s. imports were 3.3 trillion in 2024 and that tariffs would reduce them, that figure would only be achievable with average tariffs above 20. a maximum scenario considered by bloomberg raises them to 35, from the 2.4 they were at in 2024. the answer may not even be known this wednesday. the idea is to announce a tariff applicable to each country or each trading bloc, although the latter is also unclear. this reciprocal tariff is supposed to condense into a single figure all of each countrys protectionist measures, including tariffs and non-tariff barriers, whether fiscal, regulatory, or monetary. trump baselessly considers value-added taxes a protectionist measure, which already conditions, for example, tariffs on the european union. its also not entirely clear when the new tariffs will be implemented. my understanding is that the tariff announcement will come tomorrow. they will be effective immediately, and the president has been teasing this for quite some time, white house spokeswoman karoline leavitt said at a press conference on tuesday, but events often prove her wrong. some members of trumps cabinet have indicated that negotiations with various countries would be possible after the announcement, and leavitt herself admits that this is a possibility. the president is always open to a phone call, always open to a good negotiation, she said tuesday. new cars at a logistics center in duisburg, germany. martin meissner ap trump has already imposed 25 tariffs on many imports from canada and mexico, which the president says are aimed at cracking down on immigration and fentanyl smuggling. china has also been hit with 20 tariffs, ostensibly for not doing enough to stop exports of fentanyl precursors to mexico, canada, and the u.s. he has also begun imposing 25 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. he has additionally imposed a 25 tariff on imported cars, effective thursday, and on car components this one taking effect a month later. furthermore, the president has spoken at various times about his plans to impose tariffs on oil, copper, lumber, agricultural products, microprocessors, and pharmaceuticals the latter coming very soon, among other sector-specific levies. he is also considering imposing a 25 tariff on all imports from countries that buy venezuelan oil in this case, he has delegated the decision to his secretary of state, marco rubio, but it is unknown when this will be implemented. also on the horizon is the possibility of retaliation against countries that impose a google tax or impose content moderation policies on social media. the trade war also has geopolitical implications, not only because trump uses tariffs as a tool of blackmail to achieve his foreign policy objectives, but because it accentuates a distrust of his allies that has already been evident in other areas. the long-standing relationship we had with the united states, based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation, is over, canadian prime minister mark carney proclaimed last week, in what sounded like an epitaph for an era. sign up for our

  Content: authored by travis gillmore via the epoch times emphasis ours, the federal government will facilitate and pay for the self-deportation of those who have entered the country illegally, while operations will continue to target gang members and violent criminals, president donald trump told fox noticias host rachel campos-duffy in an interview filmed at the white house that aired on april 15. president donald trump leaves after a ceremony for the ohio state buckeyes, the 2025 college football national champions, on the south lawn of the white house on april 14, 2025. madalina vasiliuthe epoch times the president said that stipends, including plane tickets and money, could help incentivize illegal immigrants to leave and pursue legal status. were going to make it comfortable for people, and were going to work with those people to come back into our country legally, trump said during the interview. and then . if theyre good, if we want them back in, were going to work with them to get them back in as quickly as we can. he did not provide further details about how much money illegal immigrants could receive or how to apply for such benefits. the president also announced a plan to work with some industries, including hospitality and agriculture, to help business owners mitigate the effect of mass deportations. were making it so that if a farmer can give recommendations to people, were going to be very soothing, he said. theyre sort of responsible, and were going to have the farmer take responsibility. but you know, ultimately, at some point, we want the people to go out, come back as legal. broadcast to a hispanic audience, the interview was conducted in english and released with spanish subtitles. trump successfully courted the hispanic vote during his 2024 campaign, according to exit polling that showed him garnering a record share for a republican party candidate. while the united states is offering paths to citizenship for many in the workforce, the president said aggressive deportation operations will continue for violent criminals. right now, were getting the murderers out, trump said. we have our total aim on the very bad ones, as you can imagine. these are rough, bad people. we want them out, and thats mostly our focus. he thanked salvadoran president nayib bukelewho visited the white house on april 14 to discuss migration and national security policiesfor housing violent deportees in his countrys terrorism confinement center. trump said white house officials are looking into the legality of potentially housing dangerous u.s. citizens in the supermax prison. i call them homegrown criminals, the president said. we are looking into it, and we want to do it. i would love to do that. regarding tariffs imposed on nations around the world, the president suggested that revenues could grow large enough to replace income taxes. were making tremendous amounts of money, taking in billions and billions, hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs from other countries that, for many, many decades, just ripped off the united states, he said. he also repeated his goals of introducing more lenient mortgage deductions allowing interest deductions for u.s.-made vehicles and eliminating taxes on tips, overtime, and social security. but he cautioned that political winds on capitol hill are challenging to overcome. i have some strange people i deal with, and we have to get it approved, trump said.

  Title: Trump steps back from cliff edge of global trade war - BBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-10 00:17:31)
  Content: for days, donald trump and his white house team had insisted they were fully committed to their decision to impose sweeping reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries. they even derided a report on tuesday that said the president was considering a 90-day pause news that triggered a brief stock market surge. but now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality. the reordering of the global economic order is on hold, and trumps promise of a golden age of american manufacturing will have to wait. the white house has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along. weve had more than 75 countries contact us, and i imagine, after today, there will be more, treasury secretary scott bessent told reporters shortly after the announcement. that framing from the white house is not surprising, of course. and it is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market and growing chorus of republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement. so was it a strategic retreat in the face of unexpected resistance, or yet another example of trumps art of the deal negotiating strategy at work? it didnt take long for trumps aides many of the same people who said he would never back down to fan out and celebrate the presidents move. trade adviser peter navarro said trumps tariff situation unfolded exactly the way it should. you clearly failed to see what president trump is doing here, press secretary karoline leavitt told a crowd of gathered reporters. the entire world is calling the united states of america. they were less clear about the details of trumps tariff suspension, announced via a post on his truth social website. did the reprieve in higher tariffs apply to the eu? were mexico and canada, which had avoided the original 10 baseline tariffs, somehow now included? were tariffs targeting specific sectors affected? ultimately, the white house provided some clarity on these questions but for hours us trading partners were left to scrutinise trumps truth social post and glean details from answers to questions shouted by reporters at press gaggles. on wednesday afternoon, trump acknowledged that the markets had looked pretty glum and that people were getting a little queasy a reflection that undercut some of the bravado he expressed over the past week and could hint at the real reason for his tariff change of course. earlier in the day, he was on truth social, urging people to be cool! and promising that everything is going to work out. and on monday he lashed out at what he called panicans - a party based on weak and stupid people who werent patient with his efforts. in the end, it was trump who made an abrupt change of course. he insisted, however, that his tariff announcement was one that had to be made, and that any economic disruptions reflected a sickness that had been allowed to fester in the american economy. democrats, meanwhile, painted a less rosy picture. senate minority leader chuck schumer accused trump of governing by chaos. he is reeling, he is retreating, and that is a good thing, he said. in the end, the thought process behind trumps decision may not really matter. the reality is that the us is now making nice or at least nicer - with nations that had faced their retaliatory trade fire, even though trump is still imposing a 10 across the board tariff that by itself would have been huge news just a few weeks ago. it is enough of a step down for the stock market to bounce back, however, and trump is now leaning into a trade war with china which he hit with 125 tariffs. that will have global economic repercussions of its own, but it is more in line with recent american foreign policy - including that of democratic president joe biden - as it seeks to constrain chinese ambitions. the big unknown, however, is whether trumps actions over the past week setting allies scrambling and threatening the established global order will have made such a strategy more difficult to pursue. and in 90 days, when trumps pause expires, this weeks economic drama and uncertainty could begin all over again. follow the twists and turns of trumps second term with north america correspondent anthony zurchers weekly us politics unspun newsletter. readers in the uk can sign up here. those outside the uk can sign up here. six people have been confirmed to have died following the crash near to the new jersey side of the hudson. the us government admitted kilmar abrego garcia was deported to el salvador due to administrative error. five of the individuals on board were a family of tourists from spain and the sixth person was the pilot, officials say. news of the us presidents plan to halt higher-band taxes came as a surprise on wednesday, but was it part of a plan?

  Title: Trump vs. the racists, an Obama-esque Iran play and other commentary

  Content: conservative trump vs. the racists the political right has come to accept that if there must be a civil-rights regime, it should be one of its own making, observes city journals christopher f. rufo. the first field of battle is higher education, where trump has shattered the illusion that ivy league leaders are heirs to the civil-rights movement. no they are active practitioners of racial discrimination. and trumps argument is straightforward racial discrimination is wrong no matter the victim, and any institution that continues to discriminate based on race is ineligible for federal support. the terms of this debate have now changed. the president has ensured that the civil-rights regime will no longer be a one-way lever. the important thing for the trump administration is not to blink. foreign desk an obama-esque iran play president donald trump is already growing impatient with the progress of the iran nuclear negotiations that his chief envoy, steve witkoff, started only on saturday, notes the free press eli lake. but the fact that trump did not say that iran cannot have a nuclear program, which is what he insisted on when he scuttled obamas nuclear deal with iran, is a red flag. yet obama never had this amount of leverage over iran. last year, israel destroyed the regimes strategic air defense systems and wrecked its two strongest proxies hezbollah and hamas. irans economy is crippled, with inflation above 30. so its baffling trump co. would signal that they are open to a deal that allows an unpopular regime to keep its nuclear production capability. get opinions and commentary from our columnists subscribe to our daily post opinion newsletter! thanks for signing up! enter your email address please provide a valid email address. by clicking above you agree to the terms of use and . never miss a story. check out more newsletters left coast watch sf turns page on crime in january, crime in san francisco hit a 23-year low, cheers the washington examiners zachary faria. why? the city now has a real prosecutor, brooke jenkins, who unlike predecessor chesa boudin believes crime is bad and criminals should go to jail. boudin focused on making sure criminals served as little jail time as possible and fighting mass incarceration. he was motivated by the fact that his terrorist parents were jailed for years for their role in the 1981 brinks robbery. now san francisco is back on track in terms of crime. it can stay that way as long as residents remember the lessons of recent years. from the right vances hope for europe in an interview with unherds sohrab ahmari, vice president jd vance argues its not good for europe to be the permanent security vassal of the united states. vance believes america can still be a friend to europe, provided european leaders are prepared to assume a more independent role on the international stage, and to be more responsive to their own voters, especially when it comes to the question of immigration. europe must also address security, vance says europes entire security infrastructure, for my entire life, has been subsidised by the united states of america. as ahmari puts it, the veep would prefer to see a strong and independent europe precisely because it could then act as a better check against the foreign-policy missteps of the americans. libertarian the rise of political violence the arson attack on pennsylvania gov. josh shapiro is only part of the wave of political violence sweeping over the country, warns reasons j.d. tuccille, from the assassination attempts on donald trump to the murder of united healthcare ceo brian thompson by allegedly a man who has since become a cult figure, to arson against tesla cars and dealers. americans especially those on the political left seem increasingly open to ideologically motivated violence. political scientists have argued for years that the right is more prone to violence than the left. that always seemed a dubious claim, but certainly has not been true since the 2024 election. and the people who embrace violence are reinforcing similar attitudes in others who share their ideological beliefs. compiled by the post editorial board

  Title: Trump seeks court approval for most aggressive union-busting attempt ever
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-04 10:00:25)
  Content: now we may know why president donald trump has not reissued his three first-term, anti-union directives that sharply reduced the ability of labor leaders to represent employees. rather than hamstring federal labor organizations, trump wants to bust the unions. in another move among many to vastly expand the power of the presidency, trump issued an executive order last week that is the most aggressive attack on collective bargaining the nation has ever seen. if the action withstands judicial challenges, it will cancel legally binding union contracts covering a large swath of federal employees in many agencies that would no longer recognize union representation. trumps order would eliminate collective bargaining agreements in about three dozen agencies across the government. although he claims this is necessary under his disputably broad definition of national security, some of the agencies have little to do with that issue. and, employees at intelligence and national security agencies such as the fbi and cia already are not allowed to unionize. notably, the american academy of diplomacy, a nonpartisan organization of national security professionals and retired u.s. ambassadors, strongly opposes the order. attempting to politicize a professional workforce that has been a faithful and nonpartisan partner of our elected leadership for over 100 years since the establishment of the foreign service, its statement said, is a profound mistake. the american federation of government employees afge estimated trumps order affects 1 million feds. a statement from the national treasury employees union nteu, which filed a lawsuit against the governments move, said trump would eliminate union rights for two-thirds of the entire federal workforce, which totals about 2.3 million civilian workers. it is by far the largest single action of union-busting in american history, said joseph a. mccartin, a georgetown university history professor and president of the labor and working-class history association. trumps current aggression against federal unions goes well beyond his may 2018 benchmark of three executive orders. they were revoked by president joe biden, but not before the directives impeded federal grievance procedures, quickened the firing process, expelled labor leaders from agency-provided office space, and severely cut their government-paid official time when representing unions in agency matters. this years order reflects a trump administration that is much better prepared than his first for a more thorough, systematic and deeper attack on organized labor and the government generally. a key part of this is his justice departments brazen ploy for a potentially friendly jurist to preemptively affirm the directive, even before a court challenge was lodged against it. despite the white houses earlier criticism of forum-shopping, justice asked a waco, texas, federal court to confirm trumps power to kill union contracts. the waco court has just one district judge, chosen by trump, leaving no doubt who will hear the case. the doj filed a similar preemptive action against the nteu in kentucky. the department and the white house did not respond to questions about the executive order or court venues. federal law allows presidents to exclude agencies from collective bargaining if their primary function is investigative or national security work. trumps order appears illegitimate on its face for certain agencies, said debra dagostino, a federal practice group law firm partner. while this makes sense for national security agencies, she said, it gets ridiculous when applied to organizations like the department of health and human services and the department of veterans affairs. the nteus lawsuit argues that when passing the law, congresss explicit finding was, quoting the law, the statutory protection of the right of employees to organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations of their own choosing in decisions which affect them safeguards the public interest. the american foreign service association also condemned the directive. trumps order does not mention the department of housing and urban development, but, curiously, the dojs legal brief cites hud among the agencies included. the justification for excluding hud from collective bargaining, according to justice, is hud uses computers and cybersecurity is national security because foreign adversaries are constantly seeking to penetrate agency computer systems. that claim could apply to every government office, no matter the function. beyond any national security arguments, central to the order is trumps intention to emasculate union power. collective bargaining agreements cbas, justice argued, give hostile unions powerful tools to prevent changes to agency operations they oppose, adding that the union contracts prevent agencies from adopting personnel policies that align with the presidents priorities. the dojs brief said the court should declare agencies do have the power and authority under the executive order to rescind or repudiate their labor contracts. and once repudiation is accomplished, the filing continued, agencies will no longer be bound by the terms of the cbas agencies will no longer have a duty to engage in collective bargaining with certain of their employees, and unions can no longer represent the employees in collective bargaining. unions are doing their jobs by opposing the brutal way trump has been dumping federal employees, placing thousands on leave with little or no notice, locking them out of offices and closing some agencies without congressional approval. justice acknowledges that under current law, agencies could not implement unilateral changes without seeking preclearance from union representatives. but rather than seek legislation to change the law, the trump administration is going to great lengths to defy legal contracts. filing its case for approval of trumps defiance in waco means the case against the afge, the largest federal union, will be heard by his judicial pick, judge alan albright, more than 1,200 miles from washington, where both the agencies and the union are headquartered. albright drew national attention in a 2021 court-shopping controversy because of the unusually large number of patent cases that came before him. the dojs court action is incredibly aggressive, especially given that the suit is not in fact alleging that the unions have violated any laws, said michelle bercovici, a federal employment partner with the alden law group. it appears to me that the administration is blatantly engaging in forum shopping by filing this appeal in a small, conservative district court with a sole trump-appointed federal judge. not all conservatives agree with trumps actions. in a rare display of gop pushback against him, a letter from eight republican house members urged trump to reconsider his directive and restore collective bargaining in agencies where it would not genuinely impair national security interests.

  Title: Stephen Colbert on Trump administration’s deportations: ‘It’s goodbye, habeas corpus’
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-02 15:21:53)
  Content: late-night hosts talk donald trumps alleged liberation day of tariffs and the administrations deportation of people without due process. stephen colbert i dont know about you, but i am feeling good about america! joked stephen colbert on tuesday, aka april fools day. speaking of fools, donald trump and his price-raising, economy-breaking tariffs on what the president is calling liberation day. yes, liberation day, the late show host said. im reminded of the immortal words of patrick henry give me liberty or charge me an extra 10,000 for a hyundai elantra. like everything, hes gotta make it a spectacle, colbert added, noting that trump planned to unveil his tariffs in a rose garden ceremony. because when you elect a reality tv star, you get all your economic policy via rose ceremony. experts have warned that should the tariffs go into effect and other countries retaliate, the economy would almost immediately tumble into a recession that could last for more than a year. so, if you have a retirement account, no you dont, said colbert. republicans are already scrambling to pre-contain the damage, and they settled on this fun new metaphor, he continued. that would be the short-term pain of remodeling a house, or as senator james lankford put it a bit of a mess at the beginning but everyone has a long term look of where were headed. way to connect to people suffering economic hardship, republicans, colbert deadpanned. you know that thing where you own a home but also have the money to remodel it? ok, you seem angry, let me try another analogy lets say one of your boats needs a paint job. in other news, the trump administration has done away with due process in deporting suspected gang members to el salvador, even without any evidence. on monday, the administration admitted that it deported a maryland father and legal resident because of an administrative error the administration also said they have no ability to bring him back now that he is in salvadoran custody, arguing that trumps primacy in foreign affairs outweighs the interests of the deportee and his family. if that stands, then its goodbye, habeas corpus, said colbert. trumps primacy outweighs the courts. and dont think that that only applies to folks like this detainee. if theres no due process, we have no idea if any of these people are citizens, meaning that every single person on american soil is now at risk of being disappeared until the day that trump and his goons are finally out of power. the daily show who needs the constitution when you can just deport anyone in a chicago bulls jersey to an el salvadorian prison? pic.twitter.commiwg6d8xxr the daily show thedailyshow april 2, 2025 for weeks now, ice has been rounding up any immigrant who they suspect is a member of the venezuelan gang tren de aragua, said michael kosta on tuesdays the daily show. but this week, we found out that instead of sending these suspects to a trial or a hearing you know, all the due process shit in the constitution the ice agents just fill out a checklist on the suspect. and if the suspect scores an eight or more, they get deported to an el salvadoran prison. look, im not a legal expert, said kosta. but id rather not be sentenced to life in a foreign prison with the same checklist system that cosmo uses to decide if im good girl or bad girl hot. and reading through the checklist doesnt make me feel any better, either, he continued, saying that one gets points for having a tattoo of a star, clock or michael jordan logo, or simply wearing a chicago bulls jersey. kosta also touched on the story of the maryland father granted protective legal status who was deported to el salvador because of an administrative error. could it be that the geniuses who added jeffrey goldberg to the strike team group chat arent great at identifying the correct people? he said. if only there was a way that they could have presented this suspect before another person someone who, and im just spitballing here, maybe couldve judged whether or not the person couldve been deported? we cant get one person out of a prison that we sent to that prison? he added. jd vance is out there calling dibs on rare earth minerals underneath greenland and ukraine, but with el salvador, suddenly theyre like hey, sorry, no hablo español. seth meyers and on late night, seth meyers looked ahead to trumps promised so-called liberation day of tariffs. ah yes, the day well all finally be liberated from our 401ks, he joked. apparently, the windsor knot is the preferred necktie style for members of the trump administration. and the preferred length is 84in, meyers joked. during a congressional hearing with public broadcasting officials last week, republican lawmakers accused npr representatives of pushing leftwing views. i told you they were going to come after gay marriage, meyers said over a photo of sesame streets bert and ernie. and at a rally in wisconsin, elon musk encouraged people to have children because the birth rate is declining, and said that having kids will make you feel happy. at least, the idea of them will, said meyers. you know, just knowing you have 14 or 15 of them out there somewhere, it really warms your heart.
