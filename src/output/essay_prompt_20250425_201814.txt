  Title: 'He embraced all people': Californians mourn a pope who shared their values, brought excitement to church
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-21 18:51:44)
  Content: catholics across california mourned the death of pope francis on monday, paying tribute to his modernization of the roman catholic church and steadfast commitment to the poor and marginalized. francis, the first pontiff from latin america, never visited california. but he forged a close bond with the more than 5 million catholics who live in los angeles, largely because he nudged the church to a more tolerant position on social issues by urging compassion for immigrants, arguing for tolerance of gay people and advocating for action on climate change. i have to say what im feeling today is very personal, the archbishop of los angeles, josé h. gomez, told a crowd of nearly 2,000 mourners and tourists who poured into a noon mass at the cathedral of our lady of the angels in downtown los angeles. im going to miss him big time. francis, the catholic churchs 266th leader, made history when he became the first latin american pontiff in 2013. born in 1936 in argentina to italian immigrants, he was also the first pope to take his papal name from st. francis of assisi, a saint who dedicated his life to serving the poor. gomez said francis was like a wise father, a big brother. the fact that he was from a latin american country and the first pope to speak spanish meant a lot to people in that part of the world, including immigrants in l.a. it was very special to us, gomez, who was born in monterrey, mexico, said after the afternoon mass. for us, it was a clear manifestation of the presence of the church in our countries and sense of joy knowing that we are an important part of the life of the church. outside the cathedral, which serves the largest population of catholics in the united states, mourners lay bouquets of red and white roses, white lilies and pink carnations monday morning at the feet of a mosaic of the virgin of guadalupe. inside, cynthia cook and her mother, julieta camacha, offered their silent prayers as cathedral bells rang overhead. i was just in shock, because i thought he was recovering, cook said of francis. the day before, she had watched news reports of francis giving the traditional easter blessing sunday from the balcony of st. peters basilica in the vatican. cook said francis embodied a love for everyone. as the head of the catholic church, he put it out that immigrants are gods children, she said. a tear wells up in the eye of a parishioner maria rodriguez at cathedral of our lady of the angels in downtown los angeles during a noon mass on april 21, 2025. jason armond los angeles times . in riverside, isabel torres prayed to god and asked for his guidance after the end of a packed morning mass at queen of angels catholic church. torres, who works at the church as a cleaner, said she was very sad when she found out about francis death. but at the same time, she said in spanish, i thanked god for the time he gave us with him. a mexican immigrant, torres saw francis as a reflection of god and an example for the way the catholic community should live, primarily through humility. she particularly appreciated how francis urged compassion for migrants. with the help of god almighty, i hope the death of the pope touches the hearts of these presidents, torres said. and that they see us all the same and that they understand we have the right to this world, no matter the race or color. immigrants across southern california valued francis constant emphasis on the right to migrate, said the rev. thomas p. rausch, emeritus professor of catholic theology at loyola marymount university in los angeles. its a fundamental human right, but its not one always appreciated by government, rausch said. after holding mass at queen of angels chapel, the rev. benediktus obon said he hoped the new pontiff would continue the legacy left behind by francis. he was a man of peace, obon said. he loved humanity. he embraced all people, and didnt care who you were. we are all creatures of god. obon acknowledged the role francis played in changing the negative narrative surrounding the catholic church before he took over as pope. his presence in the church brought lots of good things, obon said. he also brought lots of people back to church. for the community, this is a big loss. for obon, it was important that the next pope carries out the criticism of the current u.s. administrations treatment of immigrants that francis carried out until the last day of his life when he met with vice president j.d. vance. see them as human beings first, see them as part of yourself in other people, he said. a parishioner at cathedral of our lady of the angels in downtown los angeles kneels before a portrait of pope francis during a noon mass. jason armond los angeles times just months after assuming the papacy in 2013, francis took his first official trip outside rome to visit the italian island of lampedusa to focus on the plight of migrants and asylum seekers. we have this enormous number of people on the move today, fleeing poverty, injustice, war, violence, and hes shown a real concern for that, rausch said. francis also used his platform to urge tolerance for gay catholics. if a person is gay, and seeks god and has goodwill, who am i to judge? he told a reporter in 2013. in 2022, francis met with former u.s. house speaker nancy pelosi , and she received communion during a papal mass in st. peters basilica, after san francisco archbishop salvatore cordileone barred her from receiving the sacrament in his archdiocese because of her stance on abortion rights. i join the family of god here in the archdiocese of los angeles, and catholics all over the world, in grieving the loss of our holy father, los angeles archbishop josé h. gomez, above, said in a statement. jason armond los angeles times pelosi was one of many political figures across california who paid tribute to francis. in a statement monday, she descirbed him as a beacon of charity, hope and love for all people of faith, he saw god in all his creatures, said gov. gavin newsom, a catholic who met francis last year when he attended a climate summit at the vatican. at the time, newsom was struck by francis praise of californias position on the death penalty. pope francis led with his love of peace and creation and sought to protect and lift up the vulnerable, newsom said in a statement . his papacy was defined by moral courage, a deep respect for all creation, and a profound belief in the power of love to heal and unite. los angeles county supervisor janice hahn, who is not catholic, celebrated francis as a spiritual leader who forged connections with angelenos of all denominations. he reached millions of hearts far beyond the catholic church, she said in a statement, with his words on the greatest challenges facing our world, from war to poverty to climate change to the marginalization of lgbtq people.

  Title: SURVEY: Half Americans Have Given Up On Saving Money...
  Source: studyfinds.org (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights the prevalence of financial insecurity among Americans, influencing public perception and potentially shaping policy priorities. The repeated emphasis on savings shortfalls and reliance on savings for emergencies, "67 of americans feel theyre lagging behind their savings targets. even worse, 47 have completely given up hope," frames the issue as a widespread problem. This can lead to increased public concern and demand for solutions.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Gen Z's relatively high satisfaction with their banks (71%) but also their willingness to switch (45%). This juxtaposition is intriguing because it suggests a potential disconnect between perceived satisfaction and actual loyalty. What specific factors, beyond those mentioned, might be driving Gen Z's willingness to switch banks despite their reported satisfaction? Could this indicate a deeper dissatisfaction with certain aspects of banking services that aren't fully captured by the satisfaction metric?

  Content: christin lola - stock.adobe.com in a nutshell 67 of americans feel behind on their savings goals, with nearly half 47 believing theyll never reach their targets 63 of people with savings accounts have withdrawn money since the beginning of 2025, primarily for unexpected expenses 48 and everyday necessities 36 younger generations are more satisfied with their banks 71 of gen z vs. 41 of baby boomers, yet paradoxically are more willing to switch 45 of gen z vs. 21 of baby boomers new york most americans find themselves stuck in a discouraging pattern when it comes to saving money, with many believing their financial goals will remain forever out of reach. recent research reveals widespread money worries across all age groups, showing that for most people, financial security feels like an impossible dream. a new survey reports that 67 of americans feel theyre lagging behind their savings targets. even worse, 47 have completely given up hope, believing theyll never reach the financial milestones theyve set for themselves. the research, conducted by talker research and commissioned by consumer banking app current, questioned 2,000 americans across different generations. results reveal a concerning trend people repeatedly dipping into their savings. since january 2025, 63 of those with savings accounts have withdrawn money, with 19 nearly one in five making five or more withdrawals. these withdrawals arent funding vacations or shopping sprees. instead, americans are using their savings to cover basics and emergencies. when asked why theyre taking money out, unexpected expenses topped the list 48, followed by everyday necessities they couldnt otherwise afford 36, emergencies 30, and housing payments like rent or mortgages 23. just 18 reported using their savings for something they were actually saving towardshowing how savings accounts have shifted from future planning tools into emergency backup funds. teaching children to start saving money early in life is key to helping them avoid financial struggles in adulthood. rawpixel.com stock.adobe.com how much are americans actually saving? on average, americans try to save 496 each month, but this number doesnt tell the whole story. three in ten respondents 31 can only put aside 200 or less monthly. this limited capacitypaired with the need to withdraw for unexpected costshas left 25 of participants with smaller savings accounts now than at the start of 2025. generation x seems to be struggling the most, with 31 reporting decreased savingshigher than any other age group. millennials show more stability, with only 19 seeing their savings shrink and 39 maintaining steady balances. gen z displayed the strongest growth potential, with 38 actually building their savings during this period. americans are demonstrating incredible resilience and commitment to saving, even in challenging times, said erin bruehl, vice president of communications at current. the fact that people are actively trying to build emergency funds shows their commitment to financial responsibility. bruehl added, over 60 of people have needed to use their savings this year, highlighting exactly why americans are smart to try and build this financial cushion. their savings are successfully serving their intended purposehelping navigate both unexpected costs and ensuring they can maintain their essential needs. a generational divide the connections between americans and their banks reveal clear age differences in satisfaction and expectations. among gen z, 71 said their bank helps them reach financial goalsa satisfaction rate that drops steadily with age. only 61 of millennials, 51 of gen x, and just 41 of baby boomers shared positive feelings about their banking relationships. despite relatively high satisfaction, 52 of gen z thinks they could get better service elsewherehigher than other generations. three in ten gen zers find their banks benefits outdated, compared to only 11 of baby boomers who feel the same way. these perception gaps affect loyalty across age groups. a substantial 45 of gen z would consider switching banks, while only 21 of baby boomers would think about making such a changesuggesting banks face bigger challenges keeping younger customers who expect more from digital banking features and benefits. americans should select financial institutions that help them reach their goals, bruehl advised. online or mobile-only solutions often offer higher savings rates than traditional banks without monthly or minimum balance fees and provide additional benefits like early paycheck access and fee-free overdraft protection that provide additional cushion when bills are due. these benefits put more money in consumers pockets and can help people achieve their goals faster. the reality of american savings in todays economy the survey reveals americans trapped in a financial bind they know saving matters but face constant obstacles that derail their progress. using savings accounts as emergency funds rather than long-term growth vehicles points to a broader issue where many people struggle to build both emergency reserves and future savings simultaneously. for financial institutions, these findings highlight opportunities to better serve customers by offering relevant benefits, higher interest rates, and tools that help people track progress toward goals even during times when withdrawals are necessary. the challenges reflect broader economic conditions where rising living costs, flat wages in many sectors, and economic uncertainties continue to pressure household finances.

  Content: cape canaveral, fla. ap nasas lucy spacecraft has beamed back pictures from its latest asteroid flyby, revealing a long, lumpy, odd-shaped space rock. the space agency released the images monday, a day after the close approach. it was considered a dress rehearsal for the more critical asteroid encounters ahead closer to jupiter. this asteroid is bigger than scientists anticipated, about 5 miles 8 kilometers long and 2 miles 3.5 kilometers wide at its widest point resembling an irregular bowling pin. its so long that the spacecraft couldnt capture it in its entirety in the initial downloaded images. data returned over the next week should help clarify the asteroids shape, according to nasa. lucy passed within 600 miles 960 kilometers of the harmless asteroid known as donaldjohanson on sunday in the main asteroid belt between mars and jupiter. its named for the paleontologist who discovered the fossil lucy 50 years ago in ethiopia. the spacecraft was launched in 2021 to study the unexplored so-called trojan asteroids out near jupiter. eight trojan flybys are planned through 2033. ___ the associated press health and science department receives support from the howard hughes medical institutes science and educational media group and the robert wood johnson foundation. the ap is solely responsible for all content.

  Title: 5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday - CNBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-21 12:04:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism in international relations theory posits states as primary actors pursuing self-interest in an anarchic global system. The article text, particularly phrases like 'trumps trade war with china...continues to escalate', 'beijing promised to retaliate', and 'china will resolutely take reciprocal countermeasures', exemplifies this. These snippets reveal a dynamic of escalating tensions and retaliatory threats between major geopolitical actors driven by perceived national interests and power struggles, aligning with realist interpretations of state behavior.; Theories_and_interpretations: Keynesian economics emphasizes the role of aggregate demand and consumer sentiment in economic cycles. The article states 'americans have grown more sour on trumps handling of the economy...as tariffs and efforts to slash federal government spending hit sentiment' and 'more americans now believe the economy will get worse'. This textual evidence suggests a decline in consumer confidence and economic outlook directly linked to government policies (tariffs, spending cuts), supporting a Keynesian interpretation where government actions significantly influence economic sentiment and potentially trigger downturns.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions 'threats to the federal reserves independence after trump hinted at the termination of fed chair jerome powell' without detailing the nature of these 'threats' or the context of Trump's 'hint'. This omission is noteworthy because central bank independence is crucial for economic stability. What specific actions or statements constitute these 'threats', and what are the potential implications for market confidence if central bank autonomy is perceived to be compromised?; Intriguing_angles: The article twice states 'more americans now believe the economy will get worse than at any time since 2023'. This repetition, and the recent year 2023 as a negative benchmark, is unusual. Is this repetition an error, or is it intentional emphasis? Why is 2023 specifically highlighted? Does this reference point to a particular economic shift or policy change around that time that is being implicitly compared to the current situation, thus framing current pessimism as a significant recent decline?

  Title: Stock market rallies after closed-door remarks by Treasury Secretary Bessent - Fortune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 20:15:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The recurring mentions of 'Trump tariffs' and 'Trump policy changes' alongside discussions of corporate hits (RTX), market reactions ('volatility spike', 'markets open sharply higher'), and geopolitical shifts ('softens on china', 'china de-escalation') align with aspects of Political Economy theory. This perspective suggests that political decisions and the actions of key political figures (like Trump) are not merely isolated events but have direct, measurable consequences on economic actors (companies like RTX, markets) and international economic relations (China trade). The text provides evidence of this linkage by explicitly connecting policy actions (tariffs, changes) to economic outcomes (hits, market shifts).; Theories_and_interpretations: The juxtaposition of headlines about market reactions to political statements ('investors are finally taking trump seriously', 'markets open sharply higher after trump softens') and the mention of 'agenda-setting' in the context of financial news (implied by the focus on specific topics like tariffs, Fed Chair, China) could be viewed through the lens of Agenda-Setting Theory. While typically applied to media influence on public perception, here it highlights how the *focus* of political figures (Trump's statements on China, Powell) can directly influence the *agenda* of financial markets and news coverage, demonstrating the power of political rhetoric to shape economic attention and action, as evidenced by the immediate market response described.; Intriguing_angles: The text mentions 'doges staffing cuts' as a cause for the IRS's 'nightmare' tax season and potential refund delays. The term 'doges' is unusual in this context and lacks clear identification as a standard entity type (Organization, Government Agency). Its significance lies in being presented as a direct causal factor for a major government agency's operational failure, yet its nature remains undefined within the article. What entity or concept does 'doges' represent in this context, and why is it presented as a singular, impactful cause without further clarification?

  Title: Trump's Changes to the Federal Government Aren't Yet a Clear Political Winner or Loser: AP-NORC Poll
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-03 11:08:42)
  Content: washington ap president donald trumps dramatic changes to the federal government havent emerged as an obvious political winner or loser, according to a new poll that indicates some americans may be giving him the benefit of the doubt for now on his department of government efficiency. the associated press-norc center for public affairs research poll found that about 4 in 10 u.s. adults somewhat or strongly approve of trumps handling of social security and a similar share approve of the way hes managing the federal government. views of trump and his adviser elon musk are still largely intertwined, despite democrats recent focus on musk. the two men suffered a defeat on tuesday when the conservative candidate they had endorsed for the wisconsin supreme court was defeated. musk and the groups he backed spent more than 21 million in the race, the first major test of how voters feel about musks political impact. the poll, which was conducted before tuesdays election, found that both trump and musk are viewed more negatively than positively and are largely rated similarly by americans overall. very few americans have a positive view of one man and a negative view of the other. trumps actions on doge largely mirror his overall approval immigration emerged in the poll as a relative strength for trump, while trade relations with other countries appeared to be a relative weakness. unlike those issues, u.s. adults views on trumps handling of social security and management of the federal government are indistinguishable from his overall approval rating. this suggests that americans may have a less developed opinion of trumps actions in this area, or they may be waiting to weigh the impact. there are hints in the poll that trumps pledge to cut government spending may be resonating. closer to half of u.s. adults approve of trumps approach to government spending, which is slightly higher than his overall approval rating. i love doge, said adam marefka, a 42-year-old facilities maintenance specialist from birmingham, alabama, and a trump supporter. theyre cutting wasteful spending. we need a smaller government, and theres only one way to do that. others see recklessness. or, as paul vaitkus, of st. petersburg, florida, put it total craziness. theyre not going to just trim where it needs to trim, said vaitkus, a 66-year-old retired cardiologist. theyre going to do huge damage to agencies, and its going to erode the ability of those agencies to provide services to american taxpayers. trumps handling of social security is more popular with adults age 60 or older than with younger adults. despite that, older adults who tend to be more conservative overall but would also be affected by cuts or changes to social security are no more likely to approve of how trump is handling his job generally. even if theres no clear backlash now, slashing popular programs like social security could still quickly take trump and musk into perilous territory. an ap-norc poll conducted in january found that while republicans and democrats were divided on whether the u.s. government is spending too much or too little on the military, assistance to the poor and education, solid majorities of both said that too little was being spent on social security. all i want from this country is the government to help the seniors and the veterans. not to take care of them. help them, said george collins, 80, a retired bagel maker living in fort mohave, arizona. its hard when youre living on social security. collins, a trump supporter, said the presidents second term is going much better than his first, and he wishes trumps critics and the courts would get out of his way. i wish people would just give him the time, collins said. let him try to fix it at least. few americans dislike musk and support trump despite democrats attacks on musk, the opinion of the influential billionaire remains largely indistinguishable from views on trump. about half of u.s. adults have a somewhat or very unfavorable opinion of both musk and trump, according to the poll, while about 3 in 10 have a somewhat or very favorable view of both men. only around 1 in 10 have a positive view of trump and a negative view of musk. trump picked musk to oversee a push to shrink the federal government, cull the federal workforce and slash spending on agencies disfavored by the white house, prompting a flurry of legal action. rooting out waste is an important goal, said julio carmona, a 40-year-old health professional in stratford, connecticut. but carmona believes musk, the worlds richest person, lacks significant government experience and is not the right person for the job. you pick a guy who has the means that he has, that part of it just doesnt sit well with me, carmona said. there couldve been so many different qualified people that he chose, but he chose elon musk to do that. that sliver of americans with distinct views of trump and musk appear to largely be republicans. about half of republicans, for example, have a very favorable view of trump, while about 4 in 10 say that about musk. theyre far from a majority of people who share their party identity, though about two-thirds of republicans have a positive view of both trump and musk. ___ cooper reported from phoenix. ___ the ap-norc poll of 1,229 adults was conducted march 20-24, using a sample drawn from norcs probability-based amerispeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the u.s. population. the margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: PROTESTS ACROSS NATION...
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-06 19:25:36)
  Content: crowds of people angry about the way president donald trump is running the country marched and rallied in scores of american cities saturday in the biggest day of demonstrations yet by an opposition movement trying to regain its momentum after the shock of the republicans first weeks in office. so-called hands off! demonstrations were organized for more than 1,200 locations in all 50 states by more than 150 groups, including civil rights organizations, labor unions, lbgtq advocates, veterans and elections activists. the rallies appeared peaceful, with no immediate reports of arrests. pro-palestinian protesters carrying a depiction of president donald trump gather at a rally before marching toward the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ice headquarters, saturday, april 5, 2025, in washington. ap photomanuel balce ceneta thousands of protesters in cities dotting the nation from midtown manhattan to anchorage, alaska, including at multiple state capitols, assailed trump and billionaire elon musk s actions on government downsizing, the economy, immigration and human rights. on the west coast, in the shadow of seattles iconic space needle, protesters held signs with slogans like fight the oligarchy. protesters chanted as they took to the streets in portland, oregon, and los angeles, where they marched from pershing square to city hall. demonstrators voiced anger over the administrations moves to fire thousands of federal workers, close social security administration field offices, effectively shutter entire agencies, deport immigrants, scale back protections for transgender people and cut funding for health programs. musk, a trump adviser who runs tesla, spacex and the social media platform x, has played a key role in the downsizing as the head of the newly created department of government efficiency. he says he is saving taxpayers billions of dollars. asked about the protests, the white house said in a statement that president trumps position is clear he will always protect social security, medicare, and medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. meanwhile, the democrats stance is giving social security, medicaid, and medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush american seniors. kelley robinson, president of the human rights campaign advocacy group, criticized the administrations treatment of the lbgtq community at the rally at the national mall in washington, d.c., where democratic members of congress also took the stage. the attacks that were seeing, theyre not just political. they are personal, yall, robinson said. theyre trying to ban our books, theyre slashing hiv prevention funding, theyre criminalizing our doctors, our teachers, our families and our lives. we dont want this america, yall, robinson added. we want the america we deserve, where dignity, safety and freedom belong not to some of us, but to all of us. in boston, demonstrators brandished signs such as hands off our democracy and hands off our social security. mayor michelle wu said she does not want her children and others to live in a world in which threats and intimidation are government tactics and values like diversity and equality are under attack. activists protest president donald trump, who was a few miles away at his trump national golf club, during a hands off! demonstration saturday, april 5, 2025, in palm beach gardens, fla. ap photoalex brandon protesters carry signs and chant slogans against the policies of president donald trump and elon musk saturday, april 5, 2025, in miami. ap photomarta lavandier i refuse to accept that they could grow up in a world where immigrants like their grandma and grandpa are automatically presumed to be criminals, wu said. roger broom, 66, a retiree from delaware county, ohio, was one of hundreds who rallied at the statehouse in columbus. he said he used to be a reagan republican but has been turned off by trump. hes tearing this country apart, broom said. its just an administration of grievances. hundreds of people also demonstrated in palm beach gardens, florida, a few miles from trumps golf course in jupiter, where he spent the morning at the clubs senior club championship. people lined both sides of pga drive, encouraging cars to honk and chanting slogans against trump. they need to keep their hands off of our social security, said archer moran of port st. lucie, florida. activists protest president donald trump, who was a few miles away at his trump national golf club, during a hands off! demonstration saturday, april 5, 2025, in palm beach gardens, fla. ap photoalex brandon an activist waves an american flag upside down during a hands off! demonstration in palm beach gardens, fla., saturday, april 5, 2025. ap photoalex brandon the list of what they need to keep their hands off of is too long, moran said. and its amazing how soon these protests are happening since hes taken office. the president golfed in florida saturday and planned to do so again sunday, the white house said. activists have staged nationwide demonstrations against trump and musk multiple times since trump returned to office. but before saturday the opposition movement had yet to produce a mass mobilization like the womens march in 2017, which brought thousands of women to washington after trumps first inauguration, or the black lives matter demonstrations that erupted in multiple cities after george floyds killing by police in minneapolis in 2020. in charlotte, north carolina, protesters said they were supporting a variety of causes, from social security and education to immigration and womens reproductive rights. regardless of your party, regardless of who you voted for, whats going on today, whats happening today is abhorrent, said britt castillo, 35, of charlotte. its disgusting, and as broken as our current system might be, the way that the current administration is going about trying to fix things it is not the way to do it. theyre not listening to the people. among thousands marching through downtown san jose, california, were deborah and douglas doherty. deborah, a graphic designer, is a veteran of the 2017 womens march and was nervous that fewer people have turned out against trump this time. all the cities need to show up, she said. now people are kind of numb to it, which is itself frightening. associated press journalists julie carr smyth in columbus, ohio, fatima hussein in west palm beach, florida, erik verduzco in charlotte, north carolina, nicholas riccardi in san jose, california, and mark thiessen in anchorage, alaska, contributed.

Historical Article 8 (ID: 130873):
  Title: Pope Francis was a globalist in an age of nationalists
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-22 14:10:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article's consistent focus on the ideological conflict between 'globalism' (represented by Francis) and 'nationalism' (represented by Trump, Vance, and others) suggests this framing is central to how the information is presented. Phrases like 'the anti-globalist mission is at the heart of president donald trumps second term' and 'contempt for the globalist agenda also shaped right-wing criticism of pope francis' highlight this divide, making it a primary lens for the reader to interpret the various events and statements discussed. This emphasis shapes the perceived importance of this ideological struggle in contemporary affairs.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article implicitly contrasts a Realist approach to state action with a more universalist perspective. Trump's actions, such as withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and gutting aid, are explicitly linked to 'narrow national self-interest'. This aligns with Political Realism, where states prioritize their own perceived gains above international cooperation or moral appeals. Francis's calls for 'globalization of solidarity' and prioritizing the 'common good' stand in direct opposition, highlighting the tension between state-centric self-interest and a cosmopolitan view of global responsibility as presented in the text.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Francis's apology for 16th-century atrocities by Spanish conquistadors and the Vox party spokesperson's reaction questioning an 'argentine nationality' pope apologizing for 'others'. Textual Basis: 'The pontiffs decision in 2021 to apologize for the 16th century atrocities carried out in the new world by spanish conquistadors in the name of the catholic church provoked anger in spain, with a spokesperson for the far-right vox party scoffing i do not understand how a pope of argentine nationality can apologize on behalf of others.' Significance: This detail, seemingly historical, is used to illustrate contemporary political framing. The reaction highlights how national identity and historical events are interpreted and potentially weaponized within current political debates, particularly against figures perceived as 'globalist'. Probing Questions: How does the article's inclusion of this historical event and reaction serve to reinforce the contemporary political conflicts it describes? What does the emphasis on Francis's 'argentine nationality' in the Vox quote suggest about the underlying tensions being highlighted?; Intriguing_angles: The text notes JD Vance's use of the concept 'ordo amoris' to frame his nativism and states that Francis 'had little time for such arguments'. Textual Basis: 'in the early weeks of this trump presidency, vance attempted to frame his nativism in medieval catholic terms, citing the concept of ordo amoris... Up to his last days, francis had little time for such arguments.' Significance: This specific interaction reveals a struggle over the interpretation and application of traditional religious/philosophical concepts in modern political discourse. Vance attempts to legitimize a political stance (nativism) through selective appeal to tradition, while the religious authority figure (Francis) dismisses this application, suggesting a deeper conflict over defining values. Probing Questions: What does Vance's attempt to use 'ordo amoris' reveal about the strategies employed to bridge religious identity and political ideology? How does Francis's reported reaction challenge or validate the use of religious concepts in political arguments as presented here?

  Content: youre reading an excerpt from the worldview newsletter. sign up to get the rest, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox on mondays, wednesdays and fridays. the term globalist is mostly invoked in the pejorative. the wests right-wing nationalists, in particular, have for years laid the failures and ills of their societies at the feet of globalists conjuring a caricature of well-heeled, jet-setting elites who pursue multinational capital and cosmopolitan schemes supposedly at the expense of their countrymen. the anti-globalist mission is at the heart of president donald trumps second term it looms over the administrations moves to deport undocumented migrants and foreign students, and animates trumps protectionist zeal as he tries to reconfigure the global economic order through sweeping tariffs. contempt for the globalist agenda also shaped right-wing criticism of pope francis, the venerable argentine jesuit cleric who died monday after suffering a stroke and cardiocirculatory collapse. his support for the rights of migrants, activism over climate change and qualified acceptance of homosexuality saw u.s. right-wingers cast francis as a woke pope, sympathetic to the liberation theology of the americas reviled by vatican traditionalists and western conservatives. erstwhile trump adviser stephen k. bannon once told far-right counterparts in europe to view the pontiff as the enemy. the lepanto institute, an ultraconservative catholic think tank that raged against the francis pontificate, frequently insisted the pope was doing the work of communists. the pontiffs decision in 2021 to apologize for the 16th century atrocities carried out in the new world by spanish conquistadors in the name of the catholic church provoked anger in spain, with a spokesperson for the far-right vox party scoffing i do not understand how a pope of argentine nationality can apologize on behalf of others. francis was not spared the ire of fellow argentines, either, as ultralibertarian argentine president javier milei declared in an interview before taking office that the pope was a representative of the evil left. milei has since been more conciliatory, and waved away at their minor differences in a statement mourning the death of francis. leaders around the globe offered condolences for the loss of pope francis on april 21. video reuters its a small irony that one of pope franciss last major meetings was with vice president jd vance, a convert to catholicism who has since styled himself as a postliberal nationalist, in a nod to a particular tradition of reactionary catholic thinking. in the early weeks of this trump presidency, vance attempted to frame his nativism in medieval catholic terms, citing the concept of ordo amoris, or order of love or charity, that suggested one had a greater obligation to those closer to you than farther away. up to his last days, francis had little time for such arguments. the act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness, he wrote in a recent letter to u.s. bishops. in trumps first term, francis suggested the white houses building of border walls and separation of asylum-seeking parents from their children made the president not christian. the popes easter address delivered this weekend by a surrogate bemoaned the hatreds of any increasingly illiberal age. how much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalized and migrants, the text said. i appeal to all those in positions of political responsibility in our world not to yield to the logic of fear. francis spent years doggedly trying to counter this fear of the stranger. he washed the feet of arab migrants seeking asylum in europe. he begged forgiveness of rohingya muslims in a public ceremony after critics accused him of not doing enough to champion their plight during a 2017 visit to myanmar, whose authorities treat the persecuted minority as stateless interlopers. and he broke with papal precedent to argue in 2023 against secular antigay laws and said being homosexual is not a crime. his was the image of the good samaritan, and through him, the image he gave of the church was of a good samaritan, marco politi, a papal biographer and longtime vatican watcher, told my colleagues. selecting a new pope is a centuries-old process involving rounds of secretive voting, speeches, prayers and a dose of political maneuvering. video sarah hashemi, joe snellthe washington post francis saw himself as a globalist, but not in the terms laid out by those who revile globalism. in an address last year to the world economic forum that bastion of globalists he said the process of globalization had made clear the interdependence of the worlds nations and peoples and therefore carried a fundamentally moral dimension. he called on states and businesses to promote far-sighted and ethically sound models of globalization and to subordinate the pursuit of power and individual gain in the cause of a greater common good. in 2018, he urged the globalization of solidarity, appealing for support for the poor and those stranded in warzones or mired in humanitarian disasters. such entreaties have often gone unheeded and seem wholly at odds with the worldview of the white house, where trump has invoked narrow national self-interest to justify the gutting of u.s. humanitarian aid to the rest of word and the slashing of environmental regulations and pledges. in 2017, francis gifted trump a copy of his 192-page encyclical on ecology that noted the solid scientific consensus about human-driven climate change and called for dramatic action to reduce carbon-based emissions. the u.s. president never much of a reader didnt seem to take the message to heart, as he later pulled the united states out of the paris climate agreement. francis was elected by conclave in 2013, after many countries that were home to the planets 1.4 billion catholics had lurched out of the global financial crisis. but the ensuing years have seen waves of crises and instability. international diplomacy failed to stop hideous wars across the globe, including in ukraine and gaza where francis has long called for a lasting ceasefire. an epochal pandemic convulsed the world. in western democracies, economic inequality expanded, the liberal establishment kept crumbling and angry right-wing populism came to the fore. its unclear which cardinal will follow francis, but theres a possibility an ultraconservative backlash could yield a more doctrinaire successor. such a figure would be less adversarial with trump and vance, but would remind others of what has been lost in this popes passing.

  Title: For US Catholics, Pope Francis' Tenure Defined by Growing Divisions
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-22 10:10:42)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article highlights how conservative organizations like EWTN and the Napa Institute have expanded their reach and influence within the U.S. Church. This is evidenced by the quote: 'according to experts, the traditional movement within the u.s. church - while not dominant in the pews - expanded its reach and influence through organizations such as eternal word television network, a catholic broadcaster, and the napa institute'. This suggests these organizations are actively shaping the narrative and priorities within the U.S. Catholic community, potentially influencing public opinion and policy debates.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions a decline in Pope Francis's favorability among U.S. Catholics, dropping from 90% in 2015 to 75% in 2024. This is a significant shift. What specific factors, beyond the broad ideological clashes mentioned, contributed to this decline? Could targeted campaigns or specific events have played a disproportionate role in shaping public perception?; Intriguing_angles: The article notes that a U.S. cardinal has never been elected Pope because the Vatican sees the U.S. as having outsized influence. This is a noteworthy statement. What specific aspects of U.S. influence are perceived as problematic by the Vatican? Does this reflect concerns about cultural dominance, financial power, or political alignment?

  Content: new headline new york reuters - when pope francis visited the united states in 2015, cheering crowds of catholics and non-catholics turned out in new york, washington and philadelphia to greet him, lifting hopes that the u.s. church was about to enter a new, vibrant era. it turned out to be a period of deep discord. in the decade since that visit, an increasingly vocal and conservative segment of the u.s. church clashed with francis over everything from immigration to climate change and same-sex couples. over time, the conservative influence helped shape opinions of u.s. catholics more broadly about 75 of u.s. catholics viewed francis favorably in 2024, down from a high of about 90 in 2015. francis died at the age of 88 on monday. the growing cultural and political sway of conservatives within the u.s. catholic church was underscored by the strong support for donald trump in last years presidential elections, despite hardline policies that conflicted with those of francis. catholics voted for trump 59-39 over democrat kamala harris, a 12 percentage point swing from 2020, according to exit polling by edison research. trumps victory set up instances of conflict between the white house and the vatican. francis called trumps plans to deport millions of migrants a disgrace, and criticized his cuts to foreign aid and domestic welfare programs. in a letter to american bishops, francis also seemed to rebut the theological concept used by vice president jd vance, who became a catholic in 2019, to justify the immigration crackdown. vance and francis met briefly on sunday, hours before the popes death in what the vatican described as a cordial exchange of easter greetings. both trump and vance expressed condolences on monday. as francis health deteriorated in his final weeks, some u.s. catholics expressed admiration for the popes legacy, portraying his papacy as one of much-needed modernization. i know he gets a lot of hate for being more progressive, said carson doss, 24, of new york. maybe its because im young but i dont have a problem with it. my parents arent the biggest fans. us church an outlier david gibson, director of fordham university center on religion and culture, a catholic university in new york, described the growing traditionalism of the u.s. church as an outlier within global catholicism and increasingly so. according to experts, the traditional movement within the u.s. church - while not dominant in the pews - expanded its reach and influence through organizations such as eternal word television network, a catholic broadcaster, and the napa institute, a group formed in 2010 that hosts conferences attended by clergy, business executives and political leaders, often focused on a conservative social agenda. those organizations and other conservative leaders at times took issue with the popes focus on topics such as climate change, while resisting his calls to limit latin mass, balking at approval of conditional blessings for same-sex couples, and bristling at his informal style. those sentiments were echoed by conservatives in the pews. i didnt really like the pope, said jeff pfaff, 39, of new yorks staten island. pfaff said he disagreed with francis stance on u.s. immigration and allowing priests to perform same-sex marriage blessings. dont shove it down my throat, he said, adding that he generally goes to church about three times a month. francis stocked the church leadership with cardinals from places that had never had them before, such as tonga, haiti and mongolia, broadening representation beyond the catholic churchs stronghold in europe. they have a similar understanding of the church as francis, a similar understanding of the mission, to care for the environment, care for migrants and refugees, and care for the excluded and the downtrodden, said tom groome, a professor of theology at boston college, a catholic institution, cautioning, however, theyre not all replicas of francis. conservative u.s. cardinals may align with similarly minded adherents of the faith from africa during the conclave in hopes of choosing a conservative to succeed francis, according to massimo faggioli, a professor of religious studies at villanova university, a catholic college in pennsylvania. the names of a few u.s. bishops have surfaced as possible contenders for pope including cardinal joseph tobin of newark, archbishop robert mcelroy of washington and cardinal blase cupich of chicago. all three were close to francis, faggioli said. but a u.s. cardinal has never been elected pope, partly because the vatican sees the u.s. as having outsized influence in the church, experts said. this story has been refiled to change the headline reporting by jessica dinapoli in new york editing by paul thomasch and suzanne goldenberg

  Title: Vatican Notes 'Exchange of Opinions' Over Migrants, Prisoners in Meeting With Vance
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-19 05:10:09)
  Content: vatican city ap u.s. vice president jd vance met saturday with the vaticans no. 2 official amid tensions over the u.s. crackdown on migrants, with the holy see reaffirming good relations but noting an exchange of opinions over current international conflicts, migrants and prisoners. vance, a catholic convert, met with the secretary of state, cardinal pietro parolin, and the foreign minister, archbishop paul gallagher, in the apostolic palace. there was no indication he met with pope francis, who has sharply cut back official duties during his recovery from pneumonia. vances office said he and parolin discussed their shared religious faith, catholicism in the united states, the plight of persecuted christian communities around the world, and president trumps commitment to restoring world peace. the holy see has responded cautiously to the trump administration while seeking to continue productive relations in keeping with its tradition of diplomatic neutrality. it has expressed alarm over the administrations crackdown on migrants and cuts in international aid while insisting on peaceful resolutions to the wars in ukraine and gaza. those concerns were reflected in the vatican statement, which said the talks were cordial and that the vatican expressed satisfaction with the administrations commitment to protecting freedom of religion and conscience. there was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners, the statement said. finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the state and the catholic church in the united states, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged. the reference to serene collaboration appeared to refer to vances assertion that the u.s. conference of catholic bishops was resettling illegal immigrants in order to get federal funding. top u.s. cardinals have pushed back strongly against the claim. it is clear that the approach of the current u.s. administration is very different from what we are used to and, especially in the west, from what we have relied on for many years, parolin told la repubblica daily on the eve of vances visit. as the u.s. pushes to end the war in ukraine, parolin reaffirmed kyivs right to its territorial integrity and insisted that any peace deal must not be imposed on ukraine but is built patiently, day by day, with dialogue and mutual respect. vance was spending easter weekend in rome with his family and attended good friday services in st. peters basilica after meeting with italian premier giorgia meloni. on saturday, after introducing his family to parolin, the vances got a private tour of the sistine chapel and later visited romes botanic garden, where one of his sons was seen in a plastic gladiator costume that is popular among italian kids. it wasnt immediately clear where they would celebrate easter. francis, for his part, indicated he hoped to attend easter mass that usually draws thousands to st. peters square, according to the official mass booklet and liturgical plans released saturday. papal rebuke on migration, appeal for prisoners francis and vance have tangled sharply over migration and the trump administrations plans to deport migrants en masse. francis has made caring for migrants a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative u.s. catholic church. francis also changed church teaching to say that capital punishment is inadmissible in all cases. after a public appeal from francis just weeks before trump took office, president joe biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row. trump is an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment. vance, who converted to catholicism in 2019, identifies with a small catholic intellectual movement, viewed by some critics as having reactionary or authoritarian leanings, that is often called postliberal. postliberals share some longstanding catholic conservative views, such as opposition to abortion and lgbtq rights. they envision a counterrevolution in which they take over government bureaucracy and institutions like universities from within, replacing entrenched elites with their own and acting upon their vision of the common good. just days before he was hospitalized in february, francis blasted the trump administrations deportation plans, warning that they would deprive migrants of their inherent dignity. in a letter to u.s. bishops, francis also appeared to respond to vance directly for having claimed that catholic doctrine justified such policies. a latin concept of love vance had defended the administrations america-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval catholic theology known in latin as ordo amoris. he has said the concept delineates a hierarchy of care to family first, followed by neighbor, community, fellow citizens and lastly those elsewhere. in his feb. 10 letter, francis appeared to correct vances understanding of the concept. christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups, he wrote. the true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the good samaritan, that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception. vance has acknowledged francis criticism but has said he would continue to defend his views. during a feb. 28 appearance at the national catholic prayer breakfast in washington, vance didnt address

  Title: Contributor: Pope Francis' enduring message — unite to heal God's Earth
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 10:01:10)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article contrasts Pope Francis's consistent focus on climate change with the Trump administration's different framing of environmental issues. The article states, 'by the time pope francis assumed the papacy, one of st. francis central devotions, the environment, was already heavily politicized because of climate change' and 'president trump and his allies do not communicate about nature, pollution and climate change in such terms.' This suggests a deliberate effort to shift public attention away from climate change as a critical issue, potentially influencing public perception and policy priorities.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions the 'role of greed endemic to the ecological crisis' in Pope Francis's writings, but doesn't elaborate on specific examples or mechanisms. This omission is intriguing because it leaves the reader to infer the connection between greed and environmental damage. What specific economic practices or policies might Pope Francis be implicitly criticizing? How does this framing of greed influence the perception of responsibility for environmental issues?

  Content: pope francis, born jorge mario bergoglio, honored francis of assisi with the name he selected for himself when he was elected as pope in 2013. the popes namesake, saint francis, remains widely venerated by catholics nearly 800 years after his death, not only for his commitment to the natural world but because of his deep devotion to jesus christ as well as his ministry to poor people, including the establishment of the franciscan order. by the time pope francis assumed the papacy, one of st. francis central devotions, the environment, was already heavily politicized because of climate change. the pope often spoke directly to both the issue and the context, addressing failures of world leadership and calling for policy reform, including in preparation of remarks for the united nations annual climate conference held in dubai in 2023. that year, i began analyzing francis commentary on the environment, and the year after, as the presidential election neared, i started examining the language used on this subject by donald trump and other republican leaders. francis writings touch on many facets of climate change, including the intersection between science and religion, the need for cultural change in the way humans interact with creation and the role of greed endemic to the ecological crisis, as he termed it. in laudato si praise be on the care of our common home, his landmark climate encyclical, he asked, is it realistic to hope that those who are obsessed with maximizing profits will stop to reflect on the environmental damage which they will leave behind for future generations? where profits alone count, there can be no thinking about the rhythms of nature, its phases of decay and regeneration, or the complexity of ecosystems which may be gravely upset by human intervention. president trump and his allies do not communicate about nature, pollution and climate change in such terms. when they address the role of fossil-fuel or corporate interests and the environment, it tends to be summarized as drill, baby, drill. the trump administration is actively encouraging human intervention in nature and dismissing climate science. and yet, the president and other republicans also emphasize the importance of ensuring that americans have access to clean air and clean water. this is, in fact, what francis wanted, too, for all people. in his message for the catholic churchs world youth day 10 years ago, he put it this way we need to show a healthy concern for creation, for the purity of our air, water, and food. is this not what americans desire as well? according to a recent gallup poll, the ideologies of the american left and right are the most polarized they have been in the last 30 years. but nature, clean air and clean water are all issues everyone can rally around. on earth day, may the passing of pope francis allow us a moment to reflect upon this, and upon his words, including those written for the climate conference in dubai i too, who bear the name francis, with the heartfelt urgency of a prayer, want to leave you with this message let us leave behind our divisions and unite our forces! and with gods help, let us emerge from the dark night of wars and environmental devastation in order to turn our common future into the dawn of a new and radiant day. allison agsten is the director of the center for climate journalism and communication, at uscs annenberg school for communication and journalism.

  Content: fox friends co-host brian kilmeade joins fox friends first to discuss vp jd vances meeting with pope francis on easter sunday ahead of his passing at 88 years old. during his tenure as the head of the catholic church, pope francis, who died monday at age 88, spoke about how businesses and the economy should support the poor, while pushing back on suggestions he was anti-capitalist. the vatican announced the death of francis on monday after he recently battled double pneumonia, following a series of health challenges in recent years. francis had recovered enough to participate in easter sunday festivities in rome, where he met with vice president jd vance. vatican officials announced in an update on monday that the pope died of a cerebral stroke. francis, who was born in argentina and named jorge mario bergoglio, was interviewed by argentine journalists francesca ambrogetti and sergio rubin for their 2023 book el pastor, in which he discussed his views on capitalism and the economy, which were profiled in america magazine a catholic magazine published by the american jesuits. i do not condemn capitalism in the way some attribute to me. nor am i against the market economy, the pope said. i am in favor of what john paul ii defined as a social economy of the market. this implies the presence of a regulatory authority, that is the state, which should mediate between the parties. it is a table with three legs the state, capital, and work. pope francis dead at 88, vatican says pope francis died monday at the age of 88 following a recent battle with double pneumonia. kena betancurviewpressgetty images getty images in no part of the bible is there a commandment to produce poverty, francis said. he said that the popular beatitude blessed are the poor in spirit means the person who is not attached to riches. he added that in no way is it bad to produce wealth for the good of all and that to produce it is an act of justice. and for that justice to be complete, it has to be distributive. francis said in the book that governmental support for unemployed workers should be designed in such a way that it does not affect the culture of work, because work gives dignity to people. in remarks last june to managing directors and employees of major companies and banks, francis said that businesses should focus on challenges related to the environment, the poorest and the discarded, as well as young people. the pope urged them to put the environment at the center of their attention and said, we are living in a time of serious environmental crisis that depends on many individuals and factors, among which are the economic and business choices of past and present. it is no longer enough merely to comply with the laws of states, which are proceeding too slowly we need to innovate by anticipating the future, with courageous and forward-looking choices that can be imitated. the innovation of the entrepreneur nowadays must first and foremost be innovation in caring for our common home, francis said. what american catholics thought about pope francis the new york stock exchange honored the life of pope francis with a minute of silence on monday. michael m. santiagogetty images getty images he also urged them to not forget the poorest and the discarded, saying a circular economy has become a key term, calling for reusing and recycling waste. yet while we recycle materials and their waste, we have not yet learned allow me to use the expression to recycle and not discard people and workers, especially the most vulnerable, to whom the culture of waste often applies. it is important that you be wary of a certain meritocracy that is used to legitimize the exclusion of the poor, who are judged as undeserving, even to the point of viewing poverty itself as their fault, the pope added. the challenge is to include the poor in businesses, to make them resources for the benefit of all. this is possible. i dream of a world in which the discarded can become the protagonists of change, yet it seems to me that jesus has already accomplished that, dont you think? francis remarks also encouraged businesses to extend opportunities to young people, who he said are often among the poor of our time poor in resources, opportunities and a future. paradoxically, this occurs both where there are many of them, yet lacking in means, and where there are fewer and fewer of them such as in italy, because children are not being born here yet with available means. pope francis led the catholic church for 12 years. riccardo de lucaanadolu via getty images getty images 5 ways pope francis impacted the catholic church we do not learn any job without corporate hospitality, which means generously welcoming young people when they lack the required experience and skills, for every job is learned only by doing it, the pope said. i encourage you, then, to be generous, to welcome young people into your businesses, giving them a glimpse of the future so that an entire generation does not lose hope. in remarks to italian family businesses in october 2024, francis said, the church is the family of god, and looks kindly on everything that is family. first individuals and then the family no! first the family and, within the family, the people. in your case, you are characterized by the delicate balance between family and work, which is expressed in entrepreneurial courage and responsibility. it is good, it is constructive when courage and responsibility go together, he said. bishop barron reacts to death of pope francis, praises papacy marked by mercy and evangelization pope francis advocated for businesses to expand opportunities for the poor and the young, while also urging a focus on environmental issues. alberto pizzoliafp via getty images getty images like the mission of the church, your activity is generally rooted in a territory, which you are called upon to enrich, both with the witness of family bonds and the seriousness of your professional commitment, he said. may the gift of faith increasingly guide your presence in local realities, and strengthen your participation in the fortunes of humanity. let us not forget that everything is connected, nothing is isolated. francis said that the family businesses should keep going, to feel that you are part, in the church, of a larger family and a great undertaking, which is service to the kingdom of god and to its justice. get fox business on the go by clicking here i therefore invite you to enlarge your heart and broaden your outlook, to nurture listening, at home and in business, between different generations this is important, listening between different generations grandparents with grandchildren, this is very important, the pope said. believe in the vocation of your children whatever it may be and open doors and windows to those who wish to travel a stretch of the road with you. let us remember the parable of the talents none of what has been entrusted to you should be buried! do not be afraid, and keep going with confidence, francis said. get a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus ceo interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you. weve added you to our mailing list. by clicking subscribe, you agree to the fox news and terms of use, and agree to receive content and promotional communications from fox news. you understand that you can opt-out at any time.

  Title: Pope Francis brought an outsider’s eye to the papacy – even if healing the church’s divisions was beyond him | Catherine Pepinster
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-21 08:52:52)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article's emphasis on Pope Francis's stances on migrants, LGBTQ issues, and the environment, alongside internal church conflicts, suggests a deliberate framing of his legacy around social progressivism and institutional challenges. Justification: The text dedicates significant space to detailing his views on these specific social issues and the resistance he faced within the church regarding doctrine and reform. Interpretation: This focus potentially shapes public perception by highlighting certain aspects of his papacy while downplaying others, guiding the narrative towards a specific interpretation of his impact and the future direction of the church.; Theories_and_interpretations: The description of Francis's attempts to reform Vatican finances and address the abuse crisis, met with resistance from the 'old guard' and conservatives, can be analyzed through the lens of Organizational Theory, specifically concerning resistance to change within established institutions. Justification: The article explicitly mentions Francis 'sweeping away the old guard' and facing 'dissatisfied rumblings' and 'fiercest opponents' due to his reforms and doctrinal approaches. Interpretation: This illustrates the inherent difficulty in implementing significant structural and cultural changes within a large, historically rooted organization like the Catholic Church, where power dynamics and ideological differences create friction and limit the pace or scope of reform.

      (No specific snippets retrieved for this entity in this article)
  Content: just three days before he was admitted to hospital for bronchitis in february, pope francis delivered a strongly worded message to the us about donald trumps attitude to migrants. in a letter sent to the countrys roman catholic bishops, he made clear that he completely disagreed with trumps mass deportation plans for illegal migrants. what is built on the basis of force, and not on the truth about the equal dignity of every human being, begins badly and will end badly. the sentiment was not only reserved for trump. throughout his 12 years as pope, francis, who died this morning at the age of 88, focused on the dignity of people, especially those viewed by others as outsiders whether migrants, prisoners, whom he often visited, or lgbtq people. who am i to judge? he famously said when asked about his attitude towards gay men and women, a remark that contrasted starkly with his predecessor, pope benedict xvi, who once described homosexuality as a tendency ordered towards an intrinsic moral evil. this focus on outsiders stemmed in part from franciss own experience. he grew up in argentina, about 7,000 miles from the vatican, and was the child of migrants, whose family arrived in buenos aires in 1929, seeking a new start after scraping a living in rural italy. it was this that caused him to joke to the crowds in romes st peters square, on the night of his election in march 2013, that the cardinals had gone to the peripheries to find a new pope. while these experiences shaped franciss thinking, so did the gospels. he became one of the great communicators of christian faith, chattily expounding like a parish priest to pilgrims attending his general audiences in st peters square. he would finish reciting the angelus prayer there on sundays with a buon pranzo have a good lunch and rarely wore traditional red shoes or white trousers, complaining they made him look like an ice-cream seller. he abandoned the apostolic palace for a simple room in the casa santa marta, a residence used by bishops and cardinals visiting rome. this style forms a major part of his legacy. francis was a pope who wanted none of the pomp of a papacy. but there was substance underlying this, too. his concern for those most affected by economic hardship, war and politics, and the tide of refugees sweeping through europe and america, was matched by his empathy for those uprooted by the climate crisis. his concern for the planet what he called our common home was rooted in a reverence for gods creation. his most radical encyclical, or teaching document, laudato si, was published in 2015, putting forward scientific and theological reasons for protecting the planet from climate breakdown. he would often give his visitors a copy including trump, in 2017. view image in fullscreen a newly elected pope francis during sunday angelus prayer at the vatican, 17 march 2013. photograph tony gentilereuters despite his focus on justice, ecology and poverty, there were dissatisfied rumblings about his papacy inside the church. when the cardinals gathered in rome to vote for the successor to benedict xvi after his sudden resignation in february 2013, they wanted a reformer who could shake up the management of the churchs finances. francis swept away the old guard of cardinal overseers, and set up his own team of clerics and lay experts, after revelations of mismanagement of the vaticans own finances emerged. he also attempted to change the way the church dealt with priests involved in child sexual abuse. his changes began well, but floundered as details emerged of clerics to whom francis himself seemed to have been too lenient. some of those who supported the argentinian felt frustrated that the church moved too slowly. conservatives in the church were most outraged by franciss approach to morality, particularly his decision to urge parish priests to decide on individual cases as to whether divorced catholics who remarried should receive communion. after this, his fiercest opponents published an unprecedented document a dubia, or expression of doubt, about his teaching. they showed similar disdain for his more recent proposal, published in 2023, that outlined the possibility of blessings for same-sex couples. but liberals were frustrated, too, particularly by his refusal to countenance women becoming priests. true, he appointed several women, albeit almost entirely nuns, to key vatican positions that were previously always occupied by men. that marked huge change, as did his recent synods, which gave lay participants at the synod gatherings the representatives of ordinary catholics in the pews equal discussion and voting rights with bishops and cardinals. now, as the door to the popes room is ritually sealed, and his personal papal ring he has worn for the past 12 years is snapped in two, there will be speculation as to who will follow him. francis will have played his part in shaping the church in his image. of the 138 cardinals eligible to vote in the next conclave to elect a new pope, 110 are franciss personal picks. whoever is elected next, and whatever version of catholicism they preach, the church needs someone who understands how to use the contemporary media to reach out to the world, whether on social media, in a televised interview, or through a letter critiquing the us president. whatever else a pope has to be today, he must be a great communicator. and if the pope has that gift, then he can be not only shepherd of the worlds catholics, but someone who speaks to people of all faiths and none. there were times when francis did appear to have that talent. as to the catholic church itself, given the divisions that constantly threaten to overwhelm it, living up to the old papal title of pontifex bridge is an almost impossible task. catherine pepinster is a former editor of the tablet, the catholic journal

  Title: Trump and Francis, both elected as outsiders, sparred from afar on policy and diverged on leadership style - CNN
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-21 16:47:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article's consistent focus on specific, high-profile disagreements like immigration (the wall) and the environment (encyclical, Paris Accord) serves to frame the complex relationship between political and religious leaders primarily through these contentious policy issues. The text repeatedly returns to these points ("francis declared anyone who builds a wall... was not a christian," "trump withdrew from the paris climate accord"), suggesting these are the key lenses through which the public is encouraged to view the dynamic, potentially overshadowing other aspects of their interactions or the broader theological/political contexts.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative heavily employs Political Style Theory by contrasting the personal approaches and public personas of Francis and Trump. The opening anecdote of Francis paying his hotel bill versus Trump's Twitter reaction ("Its not pope-like!"), the description of their respective transport to the Vatican (Ford Focus vs. motorcade), and their differing views on office trappings highlight fundamental differences in style. This framing suggests that these stylistic divergences are not merely superficial but reflect deeper ideological or value-based distinctions that influence their actions and public perception, as seen in their differing approaches to representing the 'forgotten' or handling policy disagreements.

  Content: when the newly elected pope francis returned to the front desk of his hotel in rome to personally settle his bill a day after being introduced to cheering crowds in st. peters square in 2013, it was a first glimpse into the modesty that would come to define his papacy. but for one real estate developer turned reality television star observing developments from his penthouse in manhattan, it was a sign of something else. i dont like seeing the pope standing at the checkout counter front desk of a hotel in order to pay his bill, donald trump, still years from mounting his first presidential bid, wrote on twitter. its not pope-like! there was little in common between now-president trump and pope francis, who died monday at 88. the two men sparred from afar on issues of immigration and the environment, adopted divergent approaches to the sumptuous trappings of their respective offices, and lived vastly different kinds of lives. thats why ill never be pope! trump responded to a commenter on his post in 2013, who observed the difference between the pope and you is the pope doesnt have to constantly brag how great he is. yet for all the obvious differences, there was some overlap in how francis and trump arrived at their positions, and how they viewed their roles. each was elected as an outsider and brought to their office a pledge to represent societys forgotten for trump, the american workers who he said washington passed over in an era of globalization and for francis, the poor and marginalized often left to the side of a fast-changing world. both also sought dramatic changes to the institutions they ran the sprawling federal government for trump, and the billion-person strong catholic church for francis. hes a very good man who loved the world. and he especially loved people that were having a hard time. and thats good with me, trump said monday after ordering flags on federal buildings lowered to half staff. trump sent his love to american catholics before quickly turning his remarks toward his strength among catholic voters. we love you all, were with you all. they were with me through the election, as you know, very strongly, trump said at the annual white house easter egg roll. its just an honor to have the support of the catholics. i feel very badly for them because they love the pope. when they met during trumps first term at the vatican in 2017 their only face-to-face encounter trump and francis had already been tangling on the issue of immigration after francis declared anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants was not a christian. trump had spent the 2016 presidential campaign vowing to construct a wall along the southern us border to keep migrants out. those differences were put aside during trumps visit, where he was accompanied by his wife melania, who wore a traditional black veil. both leaders appeared determined not to let their dispute spoil the encounter. and like most presidents before him, trump emerged from his meeting with the pope appearing starstruck. he is something, hes really good. we had a fantastic meeting and we had a fantastic tour, it was really beautiful, trump said. trump and the first lady had arrived to the vatican about a half-hour earlier, his long motorcade and armored black suv a stark contrast to the blue ford focus that francis himself had arrived in to work that day. the meeting was not entirely devoid of politics. the pope presented trump a copy of his influential encyclical document on preserving the environment, which was interpreted as an attempt by francis to encourage trump to adopt stronger efforts at combatting climate change. it didnt appear effective trump withdrew from the paris climate accord a few weeks later. like many world leaders who watch trump from afar, francis found trump easier to talk to than his harsh language on the campaign trail might have suggested. he lightened the mood when shaking melania trumps hand, asking her in italian, did you give him potica to eat? referring to the slovenian dessert few could imagine the glamorous former model whipping up in the white house kitchen. francis also handed trump a medallion etched with the image of an olive tree, which he explained was a symbol of peace. we can use peace, trump responded. as they parted ways, trump told him i wont forget what you said. the three us presidents who met francis all found themselves moved by the experience in different ways. president barack obama took the rare step of traveling to joint base andrews to greet francis at the start of the popes blockbuster visit to the united states in 2015. later, the pope led a short parade in his open-air popemobile around the south lawn, which was crowded with thousands who had come to witness a rare papal visit to the white house, some carrying babies for the pope to kiss. the cultural moment couldnt be denied several months later on halloween, when the child of an administration official arrived to the annual white house trick-or-treating event dressed as the pontiff, complete with a tiny white car. it was on that visit that francis met privately with members of then-vice president joe bidens family in the immediate aftermath of his son beau bidens death from cancer. counseling the bidens inside an airplane hanger at the philadelphia international airport, francis provided us with more comfort that even he, i think, will understand, biden would later recount. after he became president, biden traveled to rome amid a raging debate inside the us catholic church over whether he and other politicians who support abortion rights should receive communion. afterward, biden said francis called him a good catholic and that he should continue receiving the sacrament. last year, as he was preparing to depart office under a cloud of disappointment following his exit from the 2024 race and his vice presidents loss to trump, biden had planned to visit rome again to meet francis. the trip was canceled amid wildfires in los angeles, but in his final days as president biden awarded francis the nations highest civilian honor, the presidential medal of freedom. trump and francis would never meet again after their 2017 encounter. after trump was elected to a second term, francis took harsh aim at his administrations plans for mass deportations, warning such a step would deprive migrants of their inherent dignity and will end badly. it was a remarkable rebuke, issued in a letter to us bishops. it appeared to take aim at vice president jd vance for his defense of deportations on theological grounds. christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups, the pope wrote, responding to vances assertion that people should take care of their family, communities and country before expanding care to others. in some ways, the rupture appeared to reflect a growing rift between traditionalist american catholics and the vatican under francis, which had sought to be more inclusive of same-sex couples, women and other groups. still, the discord did not appear to seep into vances meeting with francis on easter sunday, just a day before he died. vance appears to have been the last world leader francis met before his death. he sat briefly with the pope in a reception room at the casa santa marta, the vatican guesthouse where he has lived since his election in 2013. vance, who has called himself a baby catholic after converting to the faith as an adult, was on vatican grounds on sunday for less than 20 minutes, and the meeting hadnt been confirmed ahead of time. during their short session, the pope gifted the vice president a tie, rosaries and three big chocolate easter eggs for vances three children. i pray for you every day, vance could be heard telling the pontiff as they sat together at the vatican. this story has been updated with trumps remarks on monday.

Historical Article 20 (ID: 130045):
  Title: Defending Migrants Was a Priority for Pope Francis From the Earliest Days of His Papacy
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-22 10:04:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory: The article demonstrates how Pope Francis, a prominent non-state actor, repeatedly attempted to force the issue of migrant suffering onto the global political agenda, particularly by directly challenging powerful state actors like the US. The text highlights his consistent actions ('repeatedly took up the plight,' 'spoke out,' 'assailed US plans') and the reactions from political figures ('Trump... responded,' 'Homan... pushed back'), illustrating the struggle for control over the public discourse and policy focus surrounding migration, where Francis sought to elevate humanitarian concerns against dominant state security narratives.; Theories_and_interpretations: Realism vs. Humanitarianism: The conflict depicted between Pope Francis's humanitarian appeals and the actions of state actors (US, European policymakers) can be viewed through a realist lens contrasting with humanitarian principles. States are described as implementing 'increasingly restrictive policies,' 'border initiatives,' and 'mass deportations' driven by factors like 'declining public empathy' and 'public anger,' suggesting a prioritization of perceived national interests (security, border control, domestic political concerns). Francis's advocacy represents a challenge to this state-centric approach based on universal human dignity, highlighting the tension between state sovereignty/interest and non-state humanitarian norms.; Intriguing_angles: Textual Clue: The article notes Francis's meeting with Vice President JD Vance occurred 'on the day before his death,' immediately following a mention of their prior 'tangling long-distance over deportation plans.' Significance: This specific timing is presented factually but is highly suggestive, placing a final interaction with a political adversary on a contentious issue in the immediate shadow of death. It prompts consideration of the nature and potential significance of that specific, final conversation. Probing Question: What was the specific content or tone of the final meeting between Francis and Vance, and did the timing of this encounter hold any particular symbolic or substantive weight regarding their differing views on migration?; Intriguing_angles: Textual Clue: The article attributes restrictive policies to factors like 'declining public empathy' and the 'rise of the anti-immigration far-right,' presenting these as contexts for state actions. Significance: While identifying these factors, the text does not explore *why* public empathy declined or the specific mechanisms by which the 'far-right' gained influence beyond general links to migration concerns. This leaves the underlying societal and political dynamics driving these shifts largely unexamined within the narrative. Probing Question: What specific societal or political processes contributed to the described 'declining public empathy' and the 'rise of the anti-immigration far-right,' and how might understanding these mechanisms provide a more complete picture of the forces shaping migration policy?

  Content: advocating for migrants was one of pope francis top priorities. his papacy saw a refugee crisis in the mediterranean, skyrocketing numbers of migrants in the americas, and declining public empathy that led to increasingly restrictive policies around the world. francis repeatedly took up the plight of migrants from bringing asylum-seekers to the vatican with him from overcrowded island camps to denouncing border initiatives of u.s. president donald trump. on the day before his death, francis briefly met with vice president jd vance, with whom he had tangled long-distance over deportation plans. some memorable moments when francis spoke out to defend migrants july 8, 2013, lampedusa, italy for his first pastoral visit outside rome following his election, francis traveled to the italian island of lampedusa a speck in the mediterranean whose proximity to north africa put it on the front line of many smuggling routes and deadly shipwrecks. meeting migrants who had been in libya, he decried their suffering and denounced the globalization of indifference that met those who risked their lives trying to reach europe. a decade later, in a september 2023 visit to the multicultural french port of marseille, francis again blasted the fanaticism of indifference toward migrants as european policymakers doubled down on borders amid the rise of the anti-immigration far-right. april 16, 2016, lesbos, greece francis traveled to the greek island of lesbos at the height of a refugee crisis in which hundreds of thousands of people arrived after fleeing civil war in syria and other conflicts in the middle east and south asia. he brought three muslim families to italy on the papal plane. rescuing those 12 syrians from an overwhelmed island camp was a drop of water in the sea. but after this drop, the sea will never be the same, francis said. during his hospitalization in early 2025, one of those families that settled in rome said francis didnt just change their lives. he wanted to begin a global dialogue to let world leaders know that even an undocumented migrant is not something to fear, said hasan zaheda. his wife, nour essa, added he fought to broadcast migrant voices, to explain that migrants in the end are just human beings who have suffered in wars. the news of francis death shocked the family and they mourned with the whole of humanity, zaheda said. in december 2021, francis again had a dozen asylum-seekers brought to italy, this time following his visit to cyprus. feb. 17, 2016, at the us-mexico border celebrating a mass near the u.s. border in ciudad juarez, mexico, that was beamed live to neighboring el paso, texas, francis prayed for open hearts when faced with the human tragedy that is forced migration. answering a reporters question while flying back to rome, francis said a person who advocates building walls is not christian. trump, at the time a presidential candidate, was campaigning to do just that, and responded that it was disgraceful to question a persons faith. he criticized the pope for not understanding the danger of the open border that we have with mexico. oct. 24, 2021, vatican city as pressures surged in italy and elsewhere in europe to crack down on illegal migration, francis made an impassioned plea to end the practice of returning those people rescued at sea to libya and other unsafe countries where they suffer inhumane violence. he called detention facilities in libya true concentration camps. from there, thousands of migrants are taken by traffickers on often unseaworthy vessels. the mediterranean sea has become the worlds largest migrant grave with more than 30,000 deaths since 2014, when the international organization for migrations missing migrants project began counting. feb. 12, 2025, vatican city after trump returned to the white house in part by riding a wave of public anger at illegal immigration, francis assailed u.s. plans for mass deportations, calling them a disgrace. with trump making a flurry of policy changes cracking down on immigration practices, francis wrote to u.s. bishops and warned that deportations will end badly. the act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women, he wrote. u.s. border czar tom homan immediately pushed back, noting the vatican is a city-state surrounded by walls and that francis should leave border enforcement to his office. when vance visited over easter weekend, he first met with the vaticans secretary of state, cardinal pietro parolin. afterward, the holy see reaffirmed cordial relations and common interests, but noted an exchange of opinions over current international conflicts, migrants and prisoners. ___ associated press religion coverage receives support through the aps collaboration with the conversation us,

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
