  Title: UN researchers warn that Asian scam operations are spreading across the rest of the world
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-21 15:23:50)
  Content: bangkok ap transnational organized crime groups in east and southeast asia are spreading their lucrative scam operations across the globe in response to increased crackdowns by authorities, according to a u.n. report issued on monday. for several years, scam compounds have proliferated in southeast asia, especially in border areas of cambodia, laos and myanmar, as well as in the philippines, shifting operations from site to site to stay a step ahead of the police. more recently, scam centers that have bilked victims out of billions of dollars through false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes are now being reported operating as far afield as africa and latin america. asian crime syndicates have been expanding operations deeper into remote areas with lax law enforcement that are vulnerable to the influx, according to the report issued by the u.n. office on drugs and crime or unodc. the report is titled inflection point global implications of scam centers, underground banking and illicit online marketplaces in southeast asia. this reflects both a natural expansion as the industry grows and seeks new ways and places to do business, but also a hedging against future risks should disruption continue and intensify in southeast asia, benedikt hofmann, unodcs acting regional representative for southeast asia and the pacific, said in a statement. unodc estimates that hundreds of industrial-scale scam centers generate just under 40 billion in annual profits. the trend to hedge beyond the region has been consistent with continued reports of crackdowns targeting asian-led scam centers that have been found operating in africa, south asia, the middle east and select pacific islands, as well as related money laundering, people trafficking and recruitment services discovered in europe, north america and south america. in africa, nigeria has become a hot spot, with police raids in late 2024 and early 2025 leading to many arrests, including people from east and southeast asia suspected of cryptocurrency and romance scams. zambia and angola have also busted asian-linked cyberfraud operations. in latin america, the report says that its notable that brazil has emerged as one country that has faced a growing set of challenges related to cyber-enabled fraud, online gambling, and related money laundering, with some linkages to criminal groups operating in southeast asia. it also notes that in late 2023 in peru, more than 40 malaysians were rescued after being trafficked by a taiwan-based gang known as the red dragon syndicate that forced them to commit cyber-enabled fraud. the report also points to crackdowns on asian-led scam centers in the middle east and some pacific islands. alarmingly, even as asian-led groups have been expanding the geographical scope of their operations, the involvement of criminal groups from other parts of the world is also growing, the report says. new online markets, money laundering networks, stolen data products, malware, artificial intelligence and deepfake technologies are laying the ground for the rise of crime as a service, the report says. these technological innovations facilitate conducting their businesses online and adapt to crackdowns. the convergence between the acceleration and professionalization of these operations on the one hand and their geographical expansion into new parts of the region and beyond on the other translates into a new intensity in the industry one that governments need to be prepared to respond to, hofmann says.

  Title: Worries About Flying Seem to Be Taking Off. Here's How to Cope With In-Flight Anxiety
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-23 13:20:37)
  Content: new york ap adelynn campbells last plane trip ended with a panic attack that she got through largely with the help of a kind flight attendant. that was last year before 67 people died in january when an american airlines jet collided with a helicopter over washington, d.c., in the deadliest u.s. air disaster in almost a quarter century. now, campbell is even more hesitant to book a flight. its definitely spiked my concern about getting on a plane and its making the whole situation a little more stressful than it used to be, said campbell, 30, who manages a coffee shop in san diego. being at least a little nervous about flying is understandable. as mel brooks once said if god wanted us to fly, he would have given us tickets. but for some people it causes deep anxiety that could require professional help. heres a look at air travel anxiety and ways to cope with it. more people seem to be nervous about flying the evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say theyve seen and heard increased worries and not only in people who already had anxieties about flying. even people who didnt have a fear of flying are talking about it, given recent events, said jennifer dragonette, a california-based psychologist who treats people with air travel anxieties. u.s. air travel was down in march and early april compared with last year, according to tsa statistics. airlines have attributed the decline to economic uncertainty, a decline in government and corporate travel and yes concern about recent aviation incidents. faa officials recently acknowledged they werent doing enough to ensure air safety. recent polling by the associated press-norc center for public affairs research shows that fewer americans report feeling safe about flying this year. flight attendants who work planes out of the washington, d.c., airport were particularly rattled by the january collision, said sara nelson, president of the association of flight attendants union. some asked for time off to process their emotions, and at least one flight attendant left the job, she said. what is fear of flying? fear of flying sometimes called aerophobia goes beyond just being nervous about a flight. it is an intense form of anxiety that centers on certain aspects of air travel. many aerophobes get most rattled during take-off and landing, or when they think about being locked in a plane. some research has suggested it affects about 25 million u.s. adults. psychologists say it often surfaces in adulthood, developing in people who didnt mind flying as kids but grew more rattled as they aged. in many cases, it starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, at a time they are experiencing big life changes and new responsibilities like getting married or becoming a parent and they start to think that everything counts, said david carbonell, a chicago-based psychologist who authored a workbook to help people cope with flying fears. a bad flight with heavy turbulence or some other problem may trigger an anxiety that persists, he said. campbell, who has other forms of anxiety, developed a fear of flying a few years ago. she is transgender, and said travel can be stressful because of concerns about how shell be treated by airport security or in other interactions. aerophobia can be complicated, carbonell said. for many people, its not so much a fear of crashing as it is claustrophobic feelings of being in an enclosed cabin and not having control. campbell said thats what she experiences feeling trapped and unable to breathe. nelson said flight attendants regularly deal with suffering passengers weve had people have panic attacks, and weve had to give them oxygen. it can be quite intense. how to cope with flying anxiety statistics have long shown that airliners are probably the safest way to travel. according to the national safety council, the odds of dying in an airplane crash are too low to be calculated, based on 2023 statistics making them far, far lower than of being killed in a motor vehicle crash or, for that matter, walking on a sidewalk or crossing a street. but experts say you cant really reason your way out of an anxiety disorder. carbonell spends little time on statistics, telling patients i know you already looked at them all, and theyre not helping you. for people with milder levels of aerophobia, deep breathing often works. longer exhales help the body relax, said dragonette, who counseled campbell for aerophobia and other anxiety disorders at a newport healthcare residential facility in temecula, california. people suffering more extreme cases can be helped with exposure therapy. it can start by simply getting patients to become comfortable looking at photos of planes, watching videos of planes flying safely, or putting on a virtual reality headset that shows recordings of being inside a plane, dragonette said. its a matter of getting patients to learn to live with their feelings and better handle them. carbonell recommends patients take practice flights that do not involve work trips or any other responsibilities. when they have symptoms, he recommends they keep a written inventory. theyre keeping a simple count, he said. were using counting as a proxy for acceptance. its ok to ask for help nelson, who was a longtime united airlines flight attendant, says ive had situations where id sort of sit in the aisle and hold someones hand. on a frontier airlines flight last year from detroit to san diego, campbell tried breathing and other coping skills, but they didnt halt her panic attack. the passenger next to her noticed she was increasingly anxious, and summoned a flight attendant. the flight attendant took deep breaths with campbell and helped her get through it, and also took down campbells phone number and checked on her a day later. i was really impressed, she said. ___ the associated press health and science department receives support from the howard hughes medical institutes science and educational media group and the robert wood johnson foundation. the ap is solely responsible for all content. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: With U.S. Absent, China Steps in for Earthquake-Hit Myanmar
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-02 12:01:23)
  Content: by poppy mcpherson and antoni slodkowski bangkokbeijing reuters - after a 7.7 magnitude earthquake shook myanmar on friday, killing more than 2,800 people, international rescuers rushed into the devastated southeast asian country. the most ubiquitous among them have been chinese relief workers, whose blue and orange uniforms appear across videos circulating on social media. the posts are often accompanied with expressions of gratitude toward beijing, whose first responders - as well as their indian and russian colleagues - have pulled dazed survivors and bodies out from the rubble of hotels, schools, and monasteries. the reaction marks a change in the negative reception china often receives on myanmars social media because of its support for the unpopular military junta. americas chief geopolitical rival has so far pledged to deliver 100 million yuan 13.76 million worth of supplies. the first batch of aid, including tents, blankets and first aid kits arrived in yangon on monday, beijing has said. the united states, which was until recently the worlds top humanitarian donor, has offered a relatively modest 2 million. washington also said it would send a three-member assessment team, though their arrival has been delayed by problems obtaining visas from the military regime. in past years, when tsunamis, earthquakes and other disasters struck around the world, the u.s. had regularly and rapidly deployed skilled rescue workers to save lives. the american absence shows how president donald trumps moves to slash the size of the u.s. government has hobbled its ability to act during disasters, three current and former u.s. officials told reuters. with trumps blessing, billionaire elon musks department of government efficiency has enacted huge funding cuts and contractor terminations across the federal bureaucracy in the name of targeting wasteful spending. trump has also moved to fire nearly all u.s. agency for international development staff, who oversee washingtons disaster response efforts overseas. a functional usaid would have activated urban search-and-rescue teams that were capable of being deployed to myanmar in 48 hours, said marcia wong, formerly a top humanitarian official at usaid. but most of the people who would have coordinated the response have been let go, while third-party partners have lost contracts, she said. we have created a vacuum which can allow other actors to step in, wong said. former u.s. ambassador to myanmar scot marciel told reuters that while it was unlikely the junta would have allowed big u.s. military teams to enter, washington could still have responded more quickly and robustly were it not for the cuts. the state department, which administers the remaining usaid programs, did not immediately return a request for comment. the junta and chinas foreign ministry also did not respond to questions. secretary of state marco rubio said on x that the cuts targeted programs that did not serve, and in some cases even harmed u.s. interests. his spokesperson tammy bruce told reporters monday that disaster relief experts were monitoring the situation. china on front foot hours after the quake, the trump administration told congress in a pre-planned move that it was firing nearly all remaining usaid personnel and closing its foreign missions. meanwhile, beijing dispatched first-response teams, including dozens of medical workers, earthquake experts, field hospital workers and rescue dogs. those teams have been some of the main visible signs of official assistance in affected areas like mandalay and sagaing, where residents said they received no help from the military. indias foreign ministry said on tuesday its aircraft and ships had delivered 625 tons of aid, while rescue workers had recovered 16 bodies from mandalay and treated 104 patients. russia and india have also set up mobile hospitals. china has used its state media machine to broadcast its relief efforts. english-language state broadcaster cgtn was one of the few international media outlets with reporters sending on-camera dispatches from mandalay, the epicentre of the disaster. state-run news agency xinhua has also run extensive reports showing chinas relief efforts. some rescue teams entered myanmar from chinas yunnan province, travelling overland through areas held by rebels which are opposed to the junta but have a complex relationship with beijing. the decision to send rescuers by road as well as air was seen by analysts like sai tun aung lwin as a signal from beijing that it had influence with both the rebels and the junta. china appears to have opened a humanitarian corridor that effectively stretches through rebel and junta territory, said the researcher, who studies chinas role in myanmar. on social media, the anti-china sentiment is in significant decline. the junta said wednesday it had fired warning shots at a convoy from the chinese red cross because it had not asked permission to drive from yunnan through to mandalay, including through areas where junta troops have been clashing with opposition armies. beijing later said there were no casualties. profound gratitude myanmar sits between china and india and is of crucial strategic importance to both countries. washington also enjoyed warm relations with the southeast asian nation under a brief quasi-democratic period before the military seized power in 2021, toppling the elected government led by nobel peace laureate aung san suu kyi. the junta has brutally quashed dissent and sparked a spiralling civil war. however, it remains backed by beijing, which sees the junta as a guarantor of stability though rebel forces now control most of the borderlands. many in the opposition regard china negatively for its role propping up the military. a 2024 poll of regional decision-makers by the iseas-yusof ishak institute, a singapore-based think-tank, found 65 of myanmar respondents distrusted beijing. a spokesperson for myanmars national unity government, a parallel administration that includes members of suu kyis deposed government, said in a statement that it had profound gratitude to the international rescue teams who have arrived without delay to assist and save the people of myanmar. washington has retained influence, especially among the opposition to the junta, through humanitarian aid and funds for the democracy movement. the recent trump-directed cuts, however, have largely erased both. at least 28 usaid and state department programs supporting myanmar have been terminated, according to documents shared with congress and reviewed by reuters. marciel said washingtons relations with myanmar should matter to u.s. citizens because winning international backing for matters of national concern, including the willingness to stand up to china at times - all depend heavily on the extent of u.s. influence. reporting by poppy mcpherson in bangkok and

from knowledgeable sources. newsweek ai is in beta. translations may contain inaccuraciesplease refer to the original content. voice is ai-generated. inconsistencies may occur. researchers tell newsweek that new federal data showing a higher prevalence of autism is concerning, but added that the causes and symptoms are more complex than numbers. department of health and human services hhs secretary robert f. kennedy, jr. held a press conference on wednesday in washington d.c. to discuss newly released data published by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc, showing autism prevalence across the united states increasing from 1 in 36 children to 1 in 31. kennedy, joined by longtime autism researcher and educator walter zahorodny of rutgers university, has referred to the uptick in cases as an epidemic running rampant. the new data, documented via surveys of children born in 2014 and conducted in 2022 across 16 u.s. sites, show an autism prevalence 4.8 times higher than in a similar survey released 22 years ago, when prevalence was 1 in 150 children. juergen hahn serves on the autism research institutes scientific advisory board and is professor and department head of biomedical engineering at rensselaer polytechnic institute. the new data, to him, is unsurprising and indicative of years of trends. there is an uptick in cases, hahn told newsweek. it doesnt matter if you take the cdc report we use the medical claims data from the insurance company in our own work. there was an uptick over the years where we basically ran the study. you find this literally doesnt matter which country you look at or which timeframe the numbers steadily go up. when asked what the increases are attributed to, hahn called it the million-dollar question. we do know the numbers go up, he said. we dont exactly know why the numbers go up. like, one study for example, if there are more complications during pregnancy then the risk that the child has goes up, but it doesnt cost to the degree that it would explain anything. its a very complicated problem. i dont think theres one smoking gun. roma vasa, director of psychiatric services with the center for autism services, science and innovation at the kennedy krieger institute, told newsweek the prevalence report is important because it helps researchers understand trends in autism identification. this increased rate is driven by a few factors including improved awareness of autism amongst clinicians, parents, educators and other professionals improved access to screening and evaluation and expanded diagnostic criteria for autism, vasa said. what this means is that we are getting better at diagnosing autism, which means that we need to focus on making sure that children with autism and their families have access to necessary resources and supports to help them thrive. the sentiment was shared by nigel newbutt, assistant professor of advanced learning technologies at the university of florida, who said that we as a society understand and know so much more than we ever have. other factors are at play, but gatekeepers including general practitioners, educations, and parents can spot potential early signs of autismall helping to lead to earlier diagnoses. diagnosis is lagging behind the need, and many people in the usa and across the world, struggle to get a diagnosis when they need it, newbutt told newsweek. this is problematic, as it can mean when people are diagnosed, they have already lost out on the accommodations they need at school or work, and other forms of support i.e. therapy. but more importantly, and regardless of diagnosis rates or vaccine skepticism, we need to build greater understanding, provide better services, and support more inclusive and respectful environments to allow autistic groups to thrive. this means moving away from the why there are so many autistic people and towards building inclusive education systems and neuro-inclusive workplaces. amy gravino, an autism sexuality advocate and relationship coach in the center for adult autism services at rutgers university, told newsweek that the data and the way its capturedinvolving a certain subset of children at a specific age rangedoesnt always match traditional criteria for identifying cases. that includes misdiagnoses and underdiagnoses of many women and girls, as well as many people of color, said gravino, who was diagnosed herself at age 11. i dont think it gives us the fullest picture of autism that we could have, she said. its a great statistic. you have to create this idea of panic, that there must be some kind of autism epidemic, but i dont know how you can call something an epidemic when were talking about people whove always existed. weve always been here, even if we havent been counted in the cdc prevalence rate throughout history. . i would just love to see a fuller kind of picture of what autism actually is outside of one narrow presentation that applies to one narrow specific group of individuals. while the experts newsweek spoke with had mixed feelings on claims, that more awareness, screenings and evaluations have contributed to elevated rates, gravino said the data can bog down the bigger picture. we forget that behind every data point is a human being behind every statistic is a family, is a life, is someone trying to exist in this world that isnt built for people who are like us, people who are autistic, who are different, she said. we get into this murky area of competing priorities, i think, and unfortunately that creates a lot of problems because it gets stuck on the wall. . the work itself is what matters mostthe work and using the data ultimately to make those changes structurally and institutionally again to help all individuals on the spectrum. rfk jr. on april 16 we know its environmental exposure. it has to be. genes do not cause epidemics. they can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin. carter wrenn, longtime republican strategist, previously told newsweek polls are showing musks popularity is upside down. that could definitely be a problemespecially with swing voters, independents, and ticket-splitters. musk, personally, carries some negative baggage that could hurt. kennedy has pledged to devote government resources alongside world-class scientists to help find answers to the epidemic as soon as this september. newsweek is committed to journalism thats factual and fair. hold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter. newsweek is committed to

  Content: authored by janice hisle via the epoch times, transportation secretary sean duffy is telling people there is no cause for concern over the large numbers of drones flying across new jersey skies. according to the federal aviation administration faa, which is under duffys purview, more tests are planned later this year in at least three other statesnew mexico, north dakota, and mississippi. duffy said in an april 15 video posted on social media that the drone flights, like those that caused public alarm in late 2024, are authorized. specifically, the faa is conducting drone-detection testing in cape may, new jersey, through april 25. the faa said it began the tests on april 14. duffy said more than 100 commercial, off-the-shelf drones, large and small, are being used. the faa alerted local authorities and invited their participation. the faa is doing this to ensure we can properly detect drones in our airspace and make sure they dont interfere with aircraft navigation systems, duffy said. this is about protecting our national security and american safety. because drone flights may interfere with aircraft navigation, operating drones around airplanes, helicopters, and airports is dangerous and illegal, the faa said. yet the agency still receives more than 100 drone-sighting reports near airports each month. officials said the faa test drones are being flown over the water near the cape may ferry terminal during daytime hours on weekdays only. the public should not fly recreational drones near this area during the test period, it said. similar research has been done at airports during the past few years, but the faa expanded these investigations to off-airport locations, including some in alaska. duffy pledged he would continue to provide you, the american people, with this kind of candid, behind-the-scenes updates. you deserve a government thats always going to be transparent about what we say and what we do, he said. before duffy became transportation secretary in january, he was a new jersey resident. thus, he knew from personal experience that concerns about the drones festered as citizens clamored for further explanation. the public was deeply worried about the lack of clear informationcommunities, kids, families, seeing drones flying over their homes, he said. to prevent such undue concerns, duffy said, the faa has adopted a radical transparency approach to ensure that people are better informed. in december 2024, white house national security adviser john kirby said there was no evidence that the reported drone sightings pose a national-security threat or a public-safety threat. authorities were inundated with at least 5,000 reports of mystery drone sightings across several states. questions lingered after president donald trump took office in january. he instructed his staff to release more information. on jan. 28, the ninth day of trumps second presidency, white house press secretary karoline leavitt told reporters that the faa had authorized large numbers of drones to fly over new jersey for research and various other reasons. receive a daily recap featuring a curated list of must-read stories.

  Title: Crisis counsellors brought in to air traffic control tower after fight, near-miss
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-03 09:30:16)
  Content: from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. air traffic controllers at washingtons ronald reagan national airport are being offered crisis counselling following a fight in the control tower and a near-miss incident, just two months after a fatal midair collision. these incidents have raised serious concerns about safety and operational pressures at the airport. the federal aviation administration faa announced on wednesday that it is reviewing the current arrival rate at reagan national airport to determine if it is excessive. in addition, the faa is providing extra support to air traffic controllers while investigations into the january crash, which killed 67 people when a passenger jet and an army helicopter collided, are ongoing. senator ted cruz, chair of the senate commerce committee, has expressed alarm over the recent incidents, stating that they underscore the precarious situation in the nations airspace. he criticised the armys reluctance to release a memo detailing its flight rules, warning that any further fatalities resulting from a collision near reagan will be on the armys hands. the faas decision to offer crisis counselling follows an altercation in the control tower last thursday. a 39-year-old employee from maryland was arrested on suspicion of assault and battery, according to the metropolitan washington airports authority. no details were released about the altercation. the faa said the employee was put on administrative leave while the fight is investigated. the next day, a delta passenger jet had to take evasive action as it took off from reagan because of the proximity of a flight of four air force jets involved in a flyover at arlington national cemetery. the incident continued a pattern of close calls that the ntsb has said went on for years around the airport as commercial flights repeatedly got dangerously close to helicopters and other aircraft. the faa said wednesday that it was reviewing the current arrival rate of aircraft per hour, which is disproportionately concentrated within the last 30 minutes of each hour. after the crash, the arrival rate at the airport fell to 26 an hour while crews worked to recover the wreckage of the american airlines jet and army black hawk helicopter from the potomac river. but the acting head of the faa said at a hearing last week that arrivals are now back up to 30 an hour and could go up to 32. now the agency is rethinking that. to help with the stress, the faa plans regular wellness checks of its staff at reagan as well making counsellors available. it wasnt immediately clear if the agency took that step right after the jan. 29 crash. the number of supervisors will increase from six to eight, and the agency will evaluate whether it has enough controllers working each shift. the union that represents air traffic controllers at reagan and airports across the country declined to comment on the situation. during wednesdays hearing, cruz threatened the army with a subpoena if it did not give the committee a copy of its memo spelling out when its aircraft are allowed to fly without a key system that broadcasts their location to other aircraft turned on. the fact that system wasnt activated in the black hawk that collided with the passenger jet is a key concern investigators have highlighted. with the location system turned off, the tower had to rely on radar for updates on the helicopters position that only came once every four seconds instead of every second before the crash. it begs the question, what doesnt the army want congress or the american people to know about why it was flying partially blind to the other aircraft and to the air traffic controllers near dca reagan airport?, cruz said. this is not acceptable. the army didnt immediately respond to an inquiry wednesday about the memo. the u.s. armys head of aviation, brig. gen. matthew braman, told the senate commerce committee last week that he wasnt sure if he could provide the memo because it is part of the investigation, but the head of the ntsb assured him that would be okay. the january crash was the nations deadliest plane crash since november 2001. but a series of other crashes and near misses in the months after fuelled worries about air travel even though it remains safe overall.

or she could dig her heels in and unleash an almighty blitzkrieg, castigating the french justice system with one hand and bringing down the government with the other. both options come with risks. bardella is still seen as green profile here. and so far, the french public seem pretty comfortable with mondays court ruling. an odoxa poll for le figaro published monday evening found that 54 percent of 995 respondents said they believed her sentence was a sign that france had a healthy democracy. another 65 percent said they were satisfied or indifferent to the verdict, victor goury-laffont reports. liberal unease yet even among liberal democrats, there was a sense of unease. sure, this is an affirmation of the rule of law le pen was convicted of misusing european parliament funds for campaign activities, after all. but its not a popular rejection by the demo. germanys spending push drives up borrowing costs across eurozone financial times welcome to britain, where critical whatsapp messages are a police matter reclaim the net the rise of the gurus sam freedman rachel reeves is a helpless pawn in donald trumps tariff war telegraph israel v. the resistance netanyahu cancels appointment of new shin bet head amid opposition from allies times of israel the first responders massacre 14 aid workers found dead and buried, hands bound mondoweiss guurst us blames hamas for israeli execution of palestinian medics antiwar.com kevin w. lordie. three killed in israeli strike targeting hezbollah militant in beirut arab news iran will target britains chagos base if trump attacks telegraph. the media and some readers argued that iran might not be able to reach diego garcia. iran is signaling otherwise. racist allied underestimation of russias abilities led to its win moon of alabama kevin w trump-putin parley is a bit under the weather indian punchline kevin w europe prepares itself for all-out war with russia ian proud germany decides to leave history in the past and prepare for war bbc trumps negotiators fail to understand russia and europe crashes and burns larry johnson big brother is watching you watch open source genetic database shuts down to protect users from authoritarian governments 404media. help me. the fact that police are the main users is a surprise?

  Title: Letter from Nikkei Asia's editor: Tokyo in bloom, tech scoops, tariffs, and newsroom changes
  Source: asia.nikkei.com (2025-04-04 20:11:47)
  Content: hello from tokyo. its the first week of april, and the city is in full bloom with beautiful cherry blossoms. although the small flowers have been drenched by cold rain over the past few days, the weather forecast says we can expect sunshine this weekend. i plan to enjoy hanami, or cherry blossom viewing, in a small park near my apartment to avoid the tourist crowds. april is an important month in japan, not only because the pink flowers signal the arrival of spring, but also because it marks the beginning of a new academic year and a new fiscal year for many companies. there have been changes in our newsroom as well, and i have been appointed as the editor-in-chief of nikkei asia. weve been in full swing from the very beginning of the month, working hard to provide quality news to our readers. on the morning of april 1, our chief tech correspondent in taipei delivered an international scoop about a potential merger between u.s. contract chipmaker globalfoundries and united microelectronics corp., taiwans no. 2 chipmaker. i am drafting this newsletter on the morning of thursday, april 3, just hours after the administration of u.s. president donald trump announced large-scale reciprocal tariffs. at nikkei asias tokyo headquarters, our team is closely monitoring asian stock prices and currencies, scrambling to produce market-reaction pieces, and our reporters are tracking the responses of governments and companies across the region. nikkei asia promises to serve as the voice of the asian century, delivering carefully curated, insightful journalism to our readers 247 - from the impact of the trump administrations policies on asia and deepening u.s.-china tensions to tech trends from asia that are shaping the world. our expert newsroom team is committed to analyzing global events from an asian perspective to bring you exclusive news and feature articles. please visit nikkei asia to enjoy our latest coverage. my suggested reads 1. thai airways faced extreme turbulence in may 2020 it was forced to file for bankruptcy protection, trading in its shares was suspended and it entered rehabilitation. five years on it is emerging leaner, stronger and ready to operate without the political interference that bedeviled it for years, according to its chief executive and rehabilitation administrator. they sat down for exclusive interviews with nikkei asia to explain how they see the future of the nations flag carrier. 2. the restructuring of vietnams government launched by communist party general secretary to lam is more far-reaching than elon musks doge drive in the u.s. but while few would question whether vietnam would benefit from less bureaucracy and red tape, many are taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the campaigns results. 3. china has become a world leader in smartphones and electric vehicles. now it is looking to repeat that feat in humanoid robots, an area that combines sophisticated manufacturing, complex supply chains and advances in artificial intelligence - three of the countrys strengths. 4. south korea on monday lifted a ban on short-selling for all shares. the move may help internationalize the south korean market by getting its shares included in global indexes, but analysts say that overheated stocks in industries such as defense and shipbuilding may suffer at the hands of short sellers. 5. no country embraces kitsch like japan - and thats not a bad thing, according to writer stephen mansfield. he says that the sniffy dictionary definitions of kitsch as tacky and lowbrow overlook how fun it can be. more than that, he argues, japan has a knack for elevating it to the realm of cool. through the lens this weeks top photo pick people take shelter in a makeshift camp in front of a quake-damaged building in mandalay, myanmars second-largest city, on april 1. a 7.7-magnitude earthquake, the epicenter of which was located northwest of mandalay, struck on march 28, leaving more than 3,000 people dead and injuring thousands more in the war-ravaged country. photo by reuters check out more of our photo coverage here. wishing you a wonderful weekend! akito tanaka sign up for the weekly editor-in-chiefs picks newsletter here. follow us on linkedin and instagram.

  Title: Stock market rallies after closed-door remarks by Treasury Secretary Bessent - Fortune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 20:15:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The recurring mentions of 'Trump tariffs' and 'Trump policy changes' alongside discussions of corporate hits (RTX), market reactions ('volatility spike', 'markets open sharply higher'), and geopolitical shifts ('softens on china', 'china de-escalation') align with aspects of Political Economy theory. This perspective suggests that political decisions and the actions of key political figures (like Trump) are not merely isolated events but have direct, measurable consequences on economic actors (companies like RTX, markets) and international economic relations (China trade). The text provides evidence of this linkage by explicitly connecting policy actions (tariffs, changes) to economic outcomes (hits, market shifts).; Theories_and_interpretations: The juxtaposition of headlines about market reactions to political statements ('investors are finally taking trump seriously', 'markets open sharply higher after trump softens') and the mention of 'agenda-setting' in the context of financial news (implied by the focus on specific topics like tariffs, Fed Chair, China) could be viewed through the lens of Agenda-Setting Theory. While typically applied to media influence on public perception, here it highlights how the *focus* of political figures (Trump's statements on China, Powell) can directly influence the *agenda* of financial markets and news coverage, demonstrating the power of political rhetoric to shape economic attention and action, as evidenced by the immediate market response described.; Intriguing_angles: The text mentions 'doges staffing cuts' as a cause for the IRS's 'nightmare' tax season and potential refund delays. The term 'doges' is unusual in this context and lacks clear identification as a standard entity type (Organization, Government Agency). Its significance lies in being presented as a direct causal factor for a major government agency's operational failure, yet its nature remains undefined within the article. What entity or concept does 'doges' represent in this context, and why is it presented as a singular, impactful cause without further clarification?

  Title: Weâ€™re calling it now: Agentic AI will win RSAC buzzword Bingo
  Source: www.theregister.com (2025-04-23 17:49:22)
  Content: the security industry loves its buzzwords, and this is always on full display at the annual rsa conference event in san francisco. dont believe us? take a lap on the expo floor, and youll be bombarded with enough acronyms and over-the-top claims to send you straight to the nearest bar, which will likely serve specialty cocktails with names like the great casb and firewall fizz. while the last couple of years have been all about ai promising fully autonomous security operations centers socs and predicting that large language models llms could exploit zero-days with no human intervention we expect the 2025 conference at the end of this month to be all about agentic ai. as with all emerging tech, ai agents mean different things to different people. but broadly speaking, its a task-oriented ai that sits on top of a llm and can analyze data and take action, at least somewhat independently of a human. these agents are designed to learn and improve over time, serving as intelligent assistants to security analysts rather than mere script executors. while some claims about agentic ai at rsac will be grounded in reality, plenty will be pure hype, but either way you wont be able to avoid it. from the monday, april 28 keynote titled security in the age of agentic ai, to vendors pitching how their ai agents are tackling tasks like malware analysis or defending against the latest agent-spawned threats, itll be everywhere. weve already seen early glimpses at recent vendor conferences, including microsoft ignite and google cloud next this year, where those two tech giants, along with other software vendors, have eagerly jumped aboard the agentic ai bandwagon. last year, it was about building genai assistants into software to help the administration perform an individual task. for example, write a policy or explain a finding, gartner research vp neil macdonald told the register. 2025 is all about ai agents, where an orchestrated set of actions are completed autonomously by the agent 2025 is all about ai agents or agentic ai where an orchestrated set of actions are completed autonomously by the agent, he said. its the difference between ai being a smart helper and responding to you versus agentic ai doing process- and outcome-specific things for you proactively and without the need for step-by-step guidance. while there are use cases for ai agents across nearly every industry, from payment processing to fast-food ordering, security examples include soc-related tasks such as analyzing event logs, detecting unusual traffic patterns, and triaging alerts. from an analytical process within security, an ai agent can analyze vast amounts of data very quickly, so this takes away the need for an analyst sitting behind the keyboard to constantly be writing the logic of what theyre looking for, jason lord, chief technology officer at salesforce-focused security firm autorabit told the register. agents are also effective at spotting phishing attacks, which are increasingly being generated by ai themselves. for example, an agent can analyze an email and determine this is a bad return address, lord said. this is a fake logo. this is a url thats hosted in a .parks domain and has only been up for the last 12 hours. this is legitimately bad. filter it to the security team. additionally, agents - like earlier ai tools used in network analysis - can help detect threats and flag potentially malicious traffic across large enterprise environments. so when youre looking for a security breach, and youre looking at alerts that are firing all day long, what it can do is piece those together and say, hey, based on previous detections, these three functions just happened. and heres all of the data that ive just pulled and provided to you to go make that human intelligence decision, lord said. but there are tasks that lord says he wouldnt want an agent to do. i wouldnt want it going and changing signature detection or logic, he said. i wouldnt want it opening or closing firewall ports. i wouldnt want it disabling or overriding security functions. theres also a lot that needs to happen to ensure that the agents are secured. like any ai system, theres risk bad actors could poison the data used to train the model, or trick an agent into doing something it shouldnt. im not going to go full skynet, lord said, referring to the rogue ai from the terminator films that wipes out humanity, but an ai agent could perform functions that close sections of your network, or the entire network. it could create a denial of service, internally or externally, by not having resources available. it could unintentionally leak data, pii. it could override data protection classes and allow information to be sent outside the organization. it all goes back to whos looking at this, whos going to be able to identify that theres an agent doing something incorrectly? were too focused on the excitement, not the paranoia the problem with all of the hype around agentic ai is that were too focused on the excitement, not the paranoia. paul davis, field ciso at supply chain security shop jfrog, told the register. just like genai for code, we need to have people who actually check it before they let it loose. davis pointed to manufacturing, an industry he has first-hand experience with, as an example, where computers have to be shut down and brought back online in a certain sequence or else the systems wont run properly. unless youve taught the ai about that sequence and most people dont think about it its going to break it, he said. plus, there are privacy and security concerns tied to the data used to train these models where is the data stored, and for how long? who has access to it? can it be deleted, and if so, by whom? an ai agent without data is dead in the water, davis said. data regulations are going to go nuts. so weve got the aspects of a thing that generates code, a thing that makes decisions, and runs on an infrastructure that deals with data, he added. agentic ai is on the verge of being sort of mass population. its gonna get a bit scary, and i think were going to have a few bumps on the journey. one thing seems clear its gonna be the talk of rsac, so mark agentic ai on your bingo cards, stat. i want a penny every time i hear ai or read ai at rsa so i can retire, lord said. yes, you read that correctly just a penny. and how many pennies does he expect that to net? a house in puerto rico. beach front.

  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism is relevant here. Germany's veto of the Eurofighter sale to Turkey, after the jailing of Istanbul's mayor, and Turkey's subsequent assertion that its national interests supersede individual politicians ('turkeys national interests are more valuable than erdoÄŸan or imamoÄŸlu') exemplifies the realist emphasis on national interest and power politics in international relations. This suggests that despite potential ideological differences or human rights concerns, states prioritize their strategic and economic goals.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents a series of seemingly disparate events, linked only by their occurrence on specific dates.

  Title: SE Asia keeps the peace 50 years after Vietnam War - Asia Times
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-21 04:14:51)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article highlights the ongoing competition between the US and China for influence in Southeast Asia. "washington has tried to force southeast asia to align with its aims of constraining and countering chinas rise." This reflects a realist perspective, where states are seen as rational actors pursuing their national interests in a competitive international system. The article suggests that Southeast Asian nations are attempting to balance these competing pressures to maintain their own security and autonomy.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that "beijing was satisfied with receiving symbolic forms of tribute, from which southeast asian kingdoms mostly profited in terms of trade." This seems to contradict the later assertion that "beijings win-win rhetoric wears thin in a region that fears the overbearing weight of the chinese economy." Why did the author include both seemingly contradictory statements? Could this suggest a shift in China's approach or a more nuanced understanding of Southeast Asian perceptions of China's economic influence?

  Content: on april 30, 1975, the last american helicopter lifted off the roof of the us embassy in saigon hours before north vietnamese tanks crashed through the gates of then-south vietnams presidential palace, marking the end of the vietnam war. since then, southeast asia has been mostly unafflicted by interstate war. there was, of course, vietnams invasion of cambodia in december 1978 and chinas retaliatory assault on vietnam along their shared border months later in 1979. but these were largely legacies of indochinas larger conflict that started when france sought to defeat vietnams bid for independence in the 1950s. the lesson of this period half a century ago, which cost as many as four million lives, is that great powers were militarily defeated and failed to prevail. southeast asian states, although riven by internal tension and conflict, have since then managed to fend off external intrusion and coexist in awkward though peaceful equilibrium. this signifies a historical resilience and immunity that, in todays era of multipolarity and evolving spheres of influence, should serve southeast asia well. as other regions of the world fall prey to proxy conflict and perpetual instability particularly the middle east the ten nations of southeast asia have managed to resist overt great power alignment and enjoy relative geopolitical stability. southeast asia has always been difficult to subjugate. in pre-modern times, it was hard for the larger powers to mount anything other than cultural invasions. india and chinas influence was largely maintained using trade, diplomacy and, in the case of india, spirituality, as rulers in the region found useful ways to harness the caste-based hierarchies of hinduism. china repeatedly sought to impose control over vietnam but was time and again repelled. beijing was satisfied with receiving symbolic forms of tribute, from which southeast asian kingdoms mostly profited in terms of trade. the arrival of europeans in the 16th century heralded more successful intrusion, with the portuguese, spanish, dutch, english and later the french establishing trading empires based on military control over key ports. much later these became the focal points of larger imperial domains that harnessed people to the land to produce valuable exports of commodities. only thailand resisted imperial takeover while relinquishing territory to ever-pressing french and british empires to its east and west. japans invasion and occupation of the region in the 1940s set the stage for home-grown nationalism that eventually managed to overcome european rule. it was this strong sense of nationalist identity, drawing on european ideas of liberalism as well as communism, that set the stage for americas ultimate defeat in vietnam. today, two generations on, the vietnam war is a distant memory. although for much of the region outside vietnam there was much to gain from the wider impact of the conflict, and for the people of the region, just as much to lose. americas anti-communist crusade was beneficial for countries like thailand and the philippines, which saw a boom in trade and investment supported by us fears of the spread of communist ideology. this same fear of communist takeover stimulated us support for strongman military rule in many countries and stifled the democratic impulses that accompanied successful anti-colonial struggles. it took another two decades for the after-effects of american intervention to be rolled back. the peoples power revolution in the philippines in 1986 forced the us to abandon its close anti-communist ally ferdinand marcos after filipinos revolted against his repressive and kleptocratic rule. a decade plus later, suharto of indonesia, another anti-communist western ally, also succumbed to a popular reform movement. ironically, perhaps, communist party-ruled vietnam itself has not seen a longer-term freedom dividend. the triumph of hanois communist leadership over the us laid the foundations of enduring one-party rule, even as the vietnamese economy has thrived and grown into a regional powerhouse. laos and cambodia greatly suffered during the indochina conflict from massive collateral bombing campaigns that spawned harsh reactionary politics and longer-term instability from which neither country has fully recovered. as for the larger powers, half a century later, the us and china have resumed their contest for primacy in the region. for the past 15 years, washington has tried to force southeast asia to align with its aims of constraining and countering chinas rise. china has reacted by asserting claims to islands and features in the south china sea, somewhat undermining a more constructive policy since the 1990s of mutually beneficial trade and investment in the now hotly contested maritime region. even as beijings win-win rhetoric wears thin in a region that fears the overbearing weight of the chinese economy, the new trump administrations reckless trade and financial policies, not to mention the dismantling of american aid programs, have undermined the biden administrations efforts to strengthen allies and partners in the region. ultimately what has saved southeast asia from another protracted period of inter-state conflict is the regions refusal to take sides. during the vietnam war, thailand dispatched more than 35,000 troops to help defend us-backed south vietnam, while the philippines sent another 10,000 troops. today, this kind of military deployment would be hard to imagine, even though thailand and the philippines remain treaty allies of the us. one significant upshot of the indochina conflict has been the creation of weak but functional multilateral regional frameworks. the association of southeast asian nations asean, established in 1967, was principally designed to prevent interstate conflict in the region. although much maligned for its inability to manage internal conflicts within member states such as myanmar, asean has largely achieved what it was designed to do. the inability of middle eastern states to forge the same kind of multilateral cooperation and resilience has made it much easier for the us and other emerging regional powers to continue to intervene. fifteen years after the end of the iraq war, us troops remain stationed across the middle east and there is currently the possibility of a war against iran. fifty years after that last american helicopter left saigon, the us deploys a small number of rotational troops under a non-permanent base agreement with the philippines, but the majority, some 80,000, are based in japan and south korea. for if there is to be a conflict between china and the us, it is more likely to be in northeast asia, in and around the taiwan strait. michael vatikiotis, former editor-in-chief of the far eastern economic review, is a writer and veteran observer of southeast asian affairs. the views expressed

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
