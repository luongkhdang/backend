  Title: Spain unveils €11bn plan to reach long-delayed Nato defence spending target
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-22 13:24:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: Spain's increased defense spending, spurred by pressure from NATO and the perceived threat from Russia ('vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security'), aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize their security in an anarchic international system. This action demonstrates a shift towards self-reliance and power balancing within Europe.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Spain's commitment to increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP, but also mentions criticism from coalition partners who describe the plans as 'incoherent and absolutely exorbitant.' This suggests internal political divisions regarding defense priorities and resource allocation. What are the specific concerns of the coalition partners, and how might these internal disagreements affect the implementation and effectiveness of the defense plan?

  Content: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year, saying it has become obvious only europe will know how to protect europe from now on. the country which lags well behind other western nations by dedicating about 1.3 of its gdp to defence spending is one of the nato members that has been pressured by the trump administration to increase its spending, and had previously committed to hitting the 2 threshold by 2029. but speaking on tuesday morning, spains prime minister, pedro sánchez, unveiled a 10.5bn 9bn industrial and technological plan for security and defence that will allow spain to meet the 2 commitment in 2025. sánchez said the plan, which has been approved by his cabinet and will now be submitted to the eu and nato, was needed to address the current and future defence challenges. its main focus will be telecommunications, cybersecurity and buying military equipment. the enemies of europe are not just using missiles as we have seen in ukraine over the past three years, he said. theyre also using unmanned drones and paramilitary forces to sabotage supply chains and to cut gas lines and underwater cables. theyre using social networks to issue disinformation and to polarise people and spread disaffection towards democratic institutions. theyre using ai cyber-attacks and quantum computers to compromise out telecommunications, our supply networks, and our public services in order to target our way of life. the prime minister who pointed out that his administration was finally making good on the 2 commitment pledged by its conservative predecessor in 2014 said the new plan would help reinforce european security in record time. in a world thats dominated by uncertainty, europe is hope and it is certainty and that certainty must be protected by strengthening our security and defence systems because given whats going on, its obvious that only europe will know how to protect europe, he added. and spain will contribute to protecting europe. sánchez said vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security, no matter how far any eu member state was from the frontlines of the conflict in ukraine. the security and stability of ukraine, of eastern europe and the baltic and nordic countries, is also the security and the safety of spain, he said. the people who live in those countries know that putin is serious and that his words are backed by deeds and thats why they look to europe for protection. theyre looking for something important, and that is unity. spain will not be indifferent to that demand. ukraine resists, europe responds and spain fulfils its obligations. sánchez also repeated his assurances that the additional spending would not lead to increased taxes, raids on the welfare state budget, or deficit increases. the plan has faced criticism from coalition partners in the leftwing sumar platform, who described the plans as incoherent and absolutely exorbitant. in january, donald trump increased pressure on nato, claiming the us had shouldered the global defence burden for too long and saying he would ask all nato members to increase defence spending to 5 of gdp. the nato secretary-general, mark rutte, has urged member states to use the threats from washington as an incentive to take unilateral action on raising defence contributions. last month, rutte said the pressure was already paying off in countries such as spain, portugal, belgium and italy. i tell them that, well, now i am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2 by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2 because we have to spend much, much more than 2 but now i am calling you, but you might get a very, erm, patient man from washington on the line if you dont listen to me, he said.

  Title: Bank of England rate-setter says US tariffs likely to push down on inflation
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 11:13:59)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article touches upon aspects of Realism in international relations, specifically concerning trade and tariffs. The US imposing tariffs on the UK, as mentioned in the text ('the us has imposed a 10 import tariff on goods coming from the uk, a policy which also applies to many other countries'), exemplifies a state acting in its perceived self-interest to protect its economy, regardless of the impact on other nations. This action, and the UK's subsequent economic considerations, reflect the competitive and often conflictual nature of international trade relations as described by Realist theory.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents Megan Greene's analysis of potential disinflationary effects of US tariffs on the UK, but also acknowledges 'a tonne of uncertainty around this.' This uncertainty, coupled with the mention of 'both inflationary and disinflationary forces,' suggests a more complex and potentially volatile economic situation than a simple cause-and-effect narrative. What specific factors contribute most to this uncertainty, and how might they interact to produce unexpected economic outcomes?; Intriguing_angles: The opening section discusses the importance of 'parsing out the facts from the messaging' in the context of US politics, while the latter part focuses on economic analysis of UK inflation. This juxtaposition, while seemingly unrelated, could subtly imply that economic narratives are also subject to manipulation or biased framing. To what extent might political messaging influence the interpretation and presentation of economic data, and what mechanisms might facilitate such influence?

  Title: Reams of documents related to L.A. County sex abuse cases never turned over, lawyers say
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:11:23)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article illustrates aspects of the Principal-Agent Problem within the context of public institutions. The county (the principal, representing the public interest) delegates authority to its probation staff (the agents). The text highlights alleged failures of the agents (abuse) and a potential failure of the principal (the county) to adequately oversee, document, and respond to these actions over decades, as evidenced by the discovery dispute and the large settlement payout. This suggests a breakdown in the mechanisms designed to ensure agents act in the best interest of the principal and those they serve.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative around AB 218 and subsequent legislative proposals (like SB 577) reflects elements of Agenda-Setting Theory. The large volume of lawsuits enabled by AB 218 (an event/policy) has forced the issue of institutional liability and financial burden onto the legislative agenda, prompting lawmakers to propose new bills aimed at managing the fallout. The framing by Senator Laird about 'restoring equilibrium' suggests an attempt to shape the public and legislative perception of the problem and the proposed solution.

  Content: thousands of documents that could contain key details about rampant childhood sexual abuse inside a defunct santa clarita detention camp including so-called grooming drawings were left scattered inside the facility and never turned over to the victims attorneys, according to a firm suing l.a. county over the decades-old incidents. as part of the preparation for a looming june trial, attorneys with law firm manly, stewart finaldi had arranged april 15 to visit camp scott, a shuttered l.a. county probation camp where many of their clients say they were sexually abused as children. inside the facility were reams of records that the county should have turned over to the firm more than a year ago through discovery, said attorney courtney thom, whose firm has about 150 civil cases alleging sexual abuse by county probation staff. you can understand my shock when im walking through where my clients got raped as children, and there are documents everywhere, thom said at a monday superior court hearing in downtown los angeles. thom said she discovered thousands of paper grievances, a locked file cabinet labeled personnel files camps a w, and a drawing she believed was signed by thomas jackson a probation deputy accused by at least 20 women of sexually assaulting them at the camp. the drawing, included in a court filing, was of the name tami in big, block orange letters and appeared to be signed by a jackson. t. attorney james sargent, who is representing the county and accompanied thom for the tour last week, called her claims inflammatory and incorrect. they want to air what they deem as dirty laundry, said sargent, who told l.a. superior court judge lawrence riff that the personnel files they discovered had nothing to do with the staff named in the lawsuits. nor did the drawing, he said. tami wilson, a former supervisor at the camp, told him she recalled being given the hand-drawn card by a youth, he wrote in a court filing. the county announced earlier this month they planned to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of alleged sexual abuse inside the countys juvenile facilities and foster homes. the settlement believed to be the largest sex abuse settlement in u.s. history arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to file civil suits against alleged predators and the agencies that employed them. a handful of prominent firms including manly, stewart finaldi declined to participate in the settlement and have ongoing litigation. in the aftermath of ab 218, state legislators have introduced several bills to attempt to make it easier for governments and school districts to deal with the financial fallout from the deluge of suits. one of these bills sb 577 is set for a hearing tuesday. the bills author, state sen. john laird, said the legislation is intended to restore some equilibrium, lessening the financial blow to public agencies while still upholding a victims right to sue. county lawyers claim one reason the state law change has had such a devastating financial toll is because many of the records they need to fight decades-old cases are long gone. attorney john manly argued the claim flew in the face of what his firm saw at camp scott. the county has been telling all of sacramento that they dont have any documents, said manly, who urged the judge to allow his firm to publicize the footage theyd taken of the heaps of documents. we need to be able to share this with legislators. riff agreed with the countys request that the videos from inside camp scott remain confidential for now due to security risks, though he instructed both sides to try to find some common ground on whether certain videos could be made public. though camp scott hasnt been used to house youths for years, sargent wrote in a filing that may soon change. l.a. county superior court judge miguel espinoza ordered the county friday to prepare to shut down los padrinos juvenile hall the countys last remaining juvenile hall, where roughly 270 youths are held due to problems stemming from chronic understaffing. the youth presently in los padrinos will need to go somewhere, and if some wind up at camp scott, the public release of photos and videos could be seriously detrimental, sargent wrote. thom noted that both reporters and television crews have been allowed to broadcast footage taken inside the camp, including a 2001 documentary, camp scott lock-up. the l.a. times has been in there to photograph, said thom. mtv videoed more than we did.

  Title: Karen Read's second murder trial revives debate over who killed her Boston police officer boyfriend
  Source: abcnews.go.com (2025-04-22 00:14:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article highlights the prosecution's focus on 'drinking, driving, deadly consequences,' echoing a common public safety narrative. This suggests an attempt to frame the case in a way that resonates with pre-existing public concerns, potentially influencing jury perception and minimizing focus on the defense's conspiracy claims.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the defense was prevented from implicating Colin Albert in their opening statements. This is intriguing because it suggests a limitation on the defense's ability to present their full case. What is the justification for this limitation, and how might it impact the jury's perception of the defense's claims?

been warned that giving in to us demands over free speech to secure a trade deal will harm children. the concerns have been raised after sources close to the trump administration claimed vice-president jd vance wants the uk to repeal hate speech laws and ditch plans for a new online safety law in exchange for a trade deal that could see the uk avoid tariffs. he has previously suggested that free speech is being undermined by laws banning hateful comments, including abuse targeting lgbt groups or other minorities, and sees uk legislation aimed at improving online safety as an attack on us tech giants. both the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children nspcc and the think tank the centre for social justice csj have highlighted concerns over any retreat by labour on either area. matthew sowemimo, associate head of policy for child safety online at the nspcc, said the online safety act offers a foundation that we believe will vastly improve childrens experiences online. open image in gallery us vice-president jd vance mark schiefelbeinap ap for too long, too many children and young people have been exposed to harmful content, groomed, harassed, and bullied online. to ensure this vital legislation reaches its potential, we need the uk government to ensure the online safety act is strongly implemented and bolstered where needed. they must be holding ofcom and tech companies to account, and ensuring the act has enough weight behind it to change the tide for childrens safety online. sophia worringer, deputy policy director at the csj, said we have a deeply unhappy generation, amplified by the cancer of social media, whose childhood spent online is threatening their adulthood. added to this is the ballooning welfare bill with more young people than ever going straight from education into long-term sickness benefit. unless we act now to increase the age of digital consent to 16 and ban algorithms for users under 16, our forecasts show that one quarter of all uk children will suffer from a mental disorder by 2030. this is a national emergency, and we need to act now. the concerns came after the vice-president said he was optimistic on the prospect of a uk trade deal with the us, adding that donald trumps administration is working very hard to get it done. but washington sources warned that mr vance is obsessed with the collapse of western civilisation and has linked what he sees as an erosion of free speech in the uk and europe to getting a trade deal done. as well as hate speech laws , he has also raised concerns about legal cases against christians for praying silently outside abortion clinics. open image in gallery keir starmer and donald trump carl courtpa pa wire the independent was told the vice-president expressing optimism on a trade deal is a way of putting further pressure on the uk over free speech. if a deal does not go through, it makes labour look bad. the vice-president does have supporters in the uk for his agenda. lord toby young from the free speech union has said he supports mr vances desire for hate speech and online safety laws to be removed. lord young said i would prefer it if his majestys government stood up for free speech of its own volition. but as it has no intention of doing so, i welcome a bit of pressure from our american cousins. i think jd vance is absolutely right to raise the alarm about the uk and its european neighbours losing sight of free speech and its of vital importance to the proper functioning of liberal democracy. european political elites are increasingly trying to silence their critics by passing laws against misinformation, disinformation and hate speech, rather than engaging in open debate about issues like immigration, climate change and abortion. however, stephen kinsella from the clean up the internet campaign group warned watering down online safety rules to get a trade deal with trump would be a huge mistake. rules to keep our children safe, and to protect our society from hate and extremism, simply shouldnt be up for negotiation. but it also just doesnt make any kind of economic sense. right now we are all footing a huge bill for unsafe social media sites, for example in money lost to fraud, or in taxpayers money to deal with the fallout of the damage to mental health. the governments own figures show that the cost of unsafe social media is over 30bn per year. watering down online safety bills would mean the uk continues to have to pay billions to clear up the mess caused by the us companies, and thats not a good deal for us to strike. downing street has insisted that free speech concerns have not been raised in the trade negotiations, with us trade secretary howard lutnick taking the lead in most of the talks with uk business secretary jonathan reynolds. the uk is hoping for a specialised trade deal with the us which will largely focus on integrating the two countries for future growth industries such as artificial intelligence and biotech. however, there have been further complications over president trumps threat of tariffs which he has suspended for 90 days. the uk car industry is facing 25 per cent tariffs while the uk as a whole would be hit by taxes of at least 10 per cent on all exports to the us. part of mr trumps claims is that online safety laws, as well as vat are barriers to us trade. the hope is that a trade deal between the two countries would eliminate most tariffs.

chaos after sen. ted cruz repeatedly spoke over sen. amy klobuchar as the pair exchanged barbs over nationwide injunctions inhibiting president donald trumps agenda. during wednesdays hearing, the texas lawmaker excoriated federal judges and declared that nationwide injunctions are an abuse of power. cruzs comments come as republicans are attempting to pass a bill to limit judicial rulings against the trump administration. james liddell reports. andrew feinberg and katie hawkinson report from washington, d.c. far-right activist laura loomer met with president donald trump and pressed him to fire several members of the national security council and reports indicate he has taken her advice. trump fired several members of the national security council, including senior directors, after the meeting, axios reports. one u.s. official told the outlet the firings are shaping up to be a bloodbath. the new yorktimes added that at least three senior nsc officials have been fired. this comes after times first reported loomer met with trump, vice president jd vance, national security adviser mike waltz and others in the oval office on wednesday, armed with extensive research she believed worked against several staffers. donald trumps press secretary has claimed that he is partly responsible for a spiritual revival in america and is helping people move closer to god. karoline leavitt, a practicing roman catholic, said that evidence of renewed faith, especially within younger generations, was becoming more visible and that it was a beautiful sight. mike bedigan has the story. an economic analyst says the 50 percent reciprocal trade tariff on lesotho will kill the tiny southern african kingdom that the u.s. president ridiculed last month. spains prime minister has led european leaders in condemning donald trumps sweeping tariffs. pedro sanchez, whose country sells large amounts of car parts, steel and chemicals to the us, described the move to bring in reciprocal tariffs on imported goods from the eu as unintelligent and a return to 19th-century protectionism. steffie banatvala reports. its midday in new york, two and half hours since markets opened on wall street, and initial losses on the major indices appear to have leveled out for now and even recovered slightly from their trading low points. they all remain significantly down from the opening. the dow jones industrial average is now down 1,296 points 3.11 the sp 500 is down 215 points 3.79 and the tech-focused nasdaq has lost 863 points 4.90. canada will impose a 25 tariff on all vehicles imported from the united states that are not compliant with the u.s.-mexico-canada trade deal, prime minister mark carney told a press conference on thursday. carney also said the new tariffs would not apply to auto parts and would not affect vehicle content from mexico. two senior lawmakers on the senate finance committee introduced legislation on thursday aimed at limiting u.s. president donald trumps ability to impose tariffs and requiring congressional approval for new levies within 60 days. republican senator chuck grassley and democrat maria cantwell presented a bill that mandates the president to notify congress about new tariffs, providing an explanation of the rationale along with an analysis of the potential impact on u.s. businesses and consumers. congress must pass a joint resolution of approval for the new tariff within 60 days otherwise, all new tariffs on imports would expire. this bill reasserts congress role over trade policy to ensure rules-based trade policies are transparent, consistent, and benefit the american public, cantwell said. as representatives of the american people, congress has a duty to stop actions that will cause them harm. the bill is based on the war powers resolution of 1973 and aims to reestablish limits on the presidents authority to impose unilateral tariffs without congressional approval. for too long, congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch, grassley said. grassleys home state of iowa relies significantly on farm crop exports, whereas cantwells washington state hosts many export-driven companies like boeing. the senate passed legislation on wednesday that would terminate new tariffs on canada. with reporting from reuters the newsmax team and former trump lawyer and ally rudy giuliani got to ring the opening bell at the new york stock exchange this morning. bit of a shame for them that it was on a day when the presidents new tariffs cratered the stock market. heres justin baragona with more on what happened to the newsmax share price this week join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and

  Content: in a normal nation governed by the rule of law not donald trumps america, that is the governments mistaken deportation of a maryland father to a salvadoran gulag, in violation of a federal immigration judges 2019 order, might have been easily resolved. lo! just four days after the supreme court last thursday unanimously ordered the government to facilitate kilmar abrego garcias release back to the united states, el salvadors president nayib bukele was due in the oval office. bukele could have simply given the sheet-metal worker a lift back home to his wife and three children, all u.s. citizens, as part of the salvadoran entourage. for the record an earlier version of this article said president trump repeated his wishes to send citizen criminals to foreign prisons on fox news. it was during a fox noticias interview. thats not what happened on monday, of course. the casually clad bukele, self-described worlds coolest dictator, instead arrived with just the miami club promoters clothes on his back, as jon stewart quipped . then we saw the sorry spectacle of two strongmen presidents, trump and bukele, side by side in the oval office declaring themselves powerless to restore abrego garcias freedom. they smiled smugly, both in on the joke. besides, they claimed without evidence, hes a terrorist. voices calmes what hannah arendt saw in hitlers germany, we can see in trumps america political theorist hannah arendt came of age in germany as hitler came to power. her life and writings have a chilling resonance for americans today. in truth, abrego garcia and hundreds of other men were sent to el salvadors own hotel california, the terrorism confinement center, without due process charges, hearings, evidence, juries or judges. the administration called them the worst of the worst, though several media investigations found that few of the deportees, including abrego garcia, had criminal records other than immigration law infractions, and fewer yet had ties to gangs that trump has designated as terrorist groups. abrego garcias case is especially egregious. team trump admitted in court that he shouldnt have been shipped to el salvador, the one country that the federal order in 2019 said he must not be sent to, given the clear probability of future persecution. in fact , that federal immigration judge found, abrego garcia and his family were gang victims, repeatedly extorted under threat of death in el salvador. the first trump administration didnt appeal that 2019 order, just as the second hasnt. no wonder then that another judge, u.s. dist. court judge paula xinis, ordered the government to report daily on abrego garcias well-being and its attempts to return him, so far to no avail. nothing has been done. nothing, she protested tuesday, before ordering an extraordinary two-week inquiry into the administrations stunning defiance. meanwhile, the administration said in a court filing that if somehow abrego garcia did return, it would detain and deport him again. voices calmes making america a colonizer again the trump administration is trying to force a deal on ukraine and president volodymyr zelensky that would make the imperialists of the past blush. as bad as all this is, the trump-bukele bro-fest in the oval office all but confirmed that there is worse to come. the two men joked joked first in private we know thanks to bukeles post of the video and then openly to reporters that el salvador should build more megaprisons to house undesirable u.s. citizens homegrowns, trump said a couple of times, so pleased by his branding. you gotta build about five more places, he told bukele, yeah, the next phase, bukele agreed. aides cracked up. despite the yucks, trump was serious hes said before that hed love to ship citizen criminals to foreign jails. and he repeated his wishes on tuesday on fox noticias. such citizen deportations would violate another supreme court decision , from 1936, not to mention basic expectations of american justice. trump is halfway to making america a police state was the headline in the financial times the next morning. the only debatable word there is halfway. of the other two supposedly co-equal branches of government, trump has cowed congress and now is openly defying federal courts, including the supreme one. this is confirmation of a constitutional crisis , the likes of which the nation has never seen, except in other lands . more evidence on wednesday, another federal district judge, james e. boasberg, ruled that probable cause exists to find the government in criminal contempt for its willful disregard of his march order that it return the planes ferrying migrants to el salvador. voices calmes the united states careens toward a constitutional crisis what should the american people believe - trumps denials that hes defying court orders or the evidence that can be seen and heard? mondays performance in the oval office was the most chilling since trump and vice president jd vance ganged up on ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky on feb. 28. and now the offices garish new bling all the gold ornaments, wall medallions, cherubs, frames and end tables is a metaphor for trumps desecration of that sanctum. trumps amen choir of aides, including atty. gen. pam bondi and secretary of state marco rubio , piled on with further lies about abrego garcia. for instance the whopper from the execrable stephen miller, white house deputy chief of staff, that the supreme court had ruled 9-to-0 in the administrations favor, which conservative legal authority ed whelan quickly lambasted on x as an outrageous misrepresentation. talk about gaslighting. the supreme court said this about the lower federal courts order to return abrego garcia it properly requires the government to facilitate abrego garcias release from custody in el salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to el salvador. that seems clear enough to just about anyone not on trumps payroll, however cautiously worded the justices two-page order was. and yet, with trump dug in and seemingly enjoying the controversy the better to distract from his calamitous trade war it is hard to see how abrego garcia will be returned anytime soon. supreme court expert and pundit jeffrey toobin was blunt i dont think hes coming back, basically ever, he said on cnn . democrats, laser-focused on criticizing trump about the economy and skittish about immigration issues where he enjoys more support, are finally rousing to the constitutional crisis. maryland sen. chris van hollen landed in el salvador on wednesday, and others, including rep. robert garcia of long beach, also plan trips. but the ultimate pressure must come from the voters, like those who assailed republican sen. chuck grassley at a town hall in iowa this week. when grassley insisted he wouldnt help abrego garcia because thats not a power of congress, the attendees guffawed. they know better. jackiekcalmes

  Title: Now is not the time to turn our backs on the world but to face forward | Rachel Reeves
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-12 18:35:10)
  Content: this week we witnessed the uncertainty of a changing world. financial markets and nation states responding to the dawn of a new economic era and the reality of new barriers to trade. i am in no doubt that the imposition of tariffs will have a profound impact on the global economy and the economy at home. this change can be unsettling for families who are worried about the cost of living and businesses concerned about what it means for them. but our task as a government is not to be knocked off course or to take rash action which risks undermining peoples security. instead, we must rise to meet the moment and do what is right in britains national interest. thats why were taking action. on monday we announced plans to ease pressure on british car manufacturers by easing the ev mandate. on wednesday we announced a brand-new theme park to be built in bedfordshire raking in 50bn for the economy. on thursday the prime minister confirmed 30m to reopen doncaster airport. and on friday we saw growth tick up by 0.5 the biggest rise since last june. this is the plan for change in action driving infrastructure projects that will lead to the growth we need to improve living standards for everyone. for too long the global economy has not worked for working people. industries have been allowed to decline or to disappear. the cost of living crisis has exposed our vulnerability to the actions of vladimir putin, who has used energy prices as a weapon of war. and economic mismanagement has left countries more exposed to global shocks. insecurity has become a virus plaguing our economies, with an endemic of low pay and poor working conditions insecurity has become a virus plaguing our economies, with an endemic of low pay, poor working conditions and inactivity. and britain has not been alone in this. thats why our response must be guided by our national interest and security for working people. lets start with stability. economic stability is the precondition of growth. at a time of global uncertainty, businesses will rightly be looking to countries that can provide them with the confidence to invest and to grow. its why we took the decision at the autumn budget last year to fix the foundations of our economy and to put our public finances back on a firm footing after years of vandalism under the conservatives. because with that stability comes security. it is not enough for the state to simply get out of the way and to leave markets to their own devices. our economy is too exposed to global disruption and supply shocks, as recent events have shown. instead, we need a strong, smart and agile state to support key industries and back those sectors of the economy particularly affected by tariffs. this isnt about picking winners or losers. it is about using the power of government to back those sectors of the economy that can provide security for working people, whether that is in jobs or investment, and can compete in a global marketplace. that is why the prime minister and i stepped in last week to back british car manufacturers to decarbonise in a way that is sustainable, helping the transition to electric vehicles and giving them greater flexibility to hit the 2030 target. it is why this labour government acted in parliament to save british steel production for the future. and its why i am announcing a new package of support for thousands of british exporters that are set to be affected by tariffs by extending loans, guarantees and insurance to those companies facing significant short-term strain. the promise of security backed up by the actions necessary to deliver that security. but we must double down on our plan for growth. people are impatient for change. i am impatient. we cannot afford to sit still. we must go further and faster, with every part of the state from whitehall to cardiff, edinburgh to belfast, manchester to sheffield working together in our collective endeavour. so, in the coming weeks, working with cabinet colleagues across government, we will bring forward action from our industrial strategy to support our economy and take down the barriers to growth. i will be holding further talks with business leaders about how we will accelerate our plans. how we can demonstrate britains place as a safe haven to live, invest and to do business. and how we can seize the opportunities that are ahead of us. economic growth will be hardwired into the spending review too, with a laser focus on ensuring the investments we make now whether that is in energy, transport or digital deliver prosperity tomorrow. and finally, there is britains place in the world. the labour party is an internationalist party. we understand the benefits of free and fair trade and collaboration. now is not the time to turn our backs on the world but to face forward. the prime minister has shown that leadership when it comes to our countrys response to the war on ukraine and the increase in defence spending. he has shown the calm and considered leadership that is needed at moments like this. we continue to pursue the best possible deal with the us. at the same time, we will continue to pursue future trade agreements with other economies, including india, and secure an ambitious new relationship with the eu that deepens ties with our largest trading partners and delivers for britain. and later this month, i will travel to washington for the imf spring meetings, where i will make clear the uks support for institutions that underpin global economic stability. but i will also make the argument for a more balanced global economic and trading system that supports national economies to become more resilient. one that recognises the benefits of free and fair trade but also seeks to address the challenges of this new era. i am under no illusion about the difficulties that lie ahead. change can be unsettling. but, this is a government that is on your side and will continue to act in our national interest. we have a plan for change that is delivering on the promise of a better future. security for working people and renewal for britain. more pounds in peoples pockets. that is our promise and, together, that is what we will deliver.

  Title: Karen Read’s second murder trial revives debate over who killed her Boston police officer boyfriend
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-22 16:36:55)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights the prosecution's focus on 'drinking, driving, deadly consequences,' which, as Michael Coyne states, has been 'drilled into us since middle school.' This suggests an attempt to leverage pre-existing societal narratives to frame the case in a way that resonates with jurors and influences public perception.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the defense is hampered by a pretrial ruling preventing them from implicating Colin Albert in their opening statements. This is intriguing because it suggests a potential bias or constraint on the defense's ability to present a full picture of the events. What other evidence might the defense be prevented from presenting, and how might this affect the jury's perception of the case?

    - judge beverly cannone:
      > Snippet: the prosecution, however, stands to benefit from a pretrial ruling from judge beverly cannone that defense attorneys cant mention potential third-party culprits in their opening statements.
  Content: dedham, mass. ap the second murder trial of karen read, whose case has sparked a national debate on police accountability and won her legions of devoted fans, began with opening statements tuesday, more than three years after the death of her boston police officer boyfriend. read is accused of striking her boyfriend, john okeefe, with her suv in 2022 and leaving him to die alone in the snow outside of a house party in canton, a suburb about 20 miles 32 kilometers south of boston. she has been charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating a vehicle under the influence and leaving the scene. during the first trial last year, prosecutors said read intentionally backed into okeefe after she dropped him off at a house party and returned hours later to find him dead. the defense said that she was a victim of a vast police conspiracy and that okeefe was fatally beaten by another law enforcement officer at the party. a mistrial was declared last year after jurors said they were at an impasse and deliberating further would be futile. the biggest difference in the current trial is the lead prosecutor, hank brennan. brought in as a special prosecutor after the mistrial, the former defense attorney has represented a number of prominent clients, including notorious boston gangster james whitey bulger. brennan began his opening statement tuesday by describing the firefighter who raced to the scene in near-blizzard conditions and found read and two other women surrounding okeefes body on the ground. he stepped out into bedlam, he said. the firefighter then asked read what had happened, he said. youll hear her words, i hit him. i hit him. i hit him, brennan said. she admitted what she had done that night. brennan told jurors that facts and data will lead them to the truth, and that reads own statements will confirm it. but defense attorney alan jackson began his opening statement by saying the prosecutions case was based on a brazen and flawed assertion that is untethered to the facts and the evidence. john okeefe did not die from being hit by a vehicle, he said. the facts will show that. the evidence will show that. the data will show that. the science will show that and the experts will tell you that. many of the factors that made the first trial must-see television will feature in the second. most of the the same witnesses are back as are reads aggressive defense team and dozens of her supporters camped out near the courthouse many carrying free karen read signs and wearing pink. read, who has been featured in several documentaries about her case, has become a minor celebrity. a few dozen of reads supporters, many holding american flags, stood in front of the courthouse tuesday morning before moving a block away to comply with a court-ordered buffer zone. those who were reuniting hugged each other, while others took time to bring newcomers up to speed on the case. im here for justice, said ashlyn wade, a read supporter from canton. the murderer going to jail and karen being exonerated, that would be justice. the prosecution, however, stands to benefit from a pretrial ruling from judge beverly cannone that defense attorneys cant mention potential third-party culprits in their opening statements. they can develop a case against two law enforcement officers but cannot implicate alberts nephew, colin albert, as they did in the first trial. i view it as a blow to the defense strategy but not a knockout punch, daniel medwed, a law professor at northeastern university, said of the ruling. all the defense needs to do is create reasonable doubt about karen reads guilt, and that doesnt require pointing to an alternative perpetrator as a matter of law. legal experts expect prosecutors to focus on reads behavior as they did during the first trial her volatile relationship with okeefe and their night of heavy drinking. they also predict the prosecution will lay out a stronger and more coherent case that read clipped okeefe with the back of her suv and sent him tumbling to the ground using data from her car, video and stronger expert testimony. the commonwealth will focus on the theme drilled into us since middle school drinking, driving, deadly consequences, michael coyne, the dean of massachusetts school of law at andover, said in an email. the defense is expected to offer evidence that what they see as a sloppy police investigation was biased and that law enforcement officers set read up to protect the real killers. they could be helped by an audit of the canton police department released last month that found several mistakes with the investigation but no evidence of a cover-up. one of the key witnesses will be former state trooper michael proctor. he led the investigation but has since been fired after a disciplinary board found that he sent sexist and crude texts about read to his family and colleagues. michael proctor and his dismissal from the force may very well serve as the elephant in the courtroom throughout the proceedings, medwed said.

  Title: How might Trump tariffs affect UK business on ‘Liberation Day’?
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-01 23:32:28)
  Content: analysis sweeping changes set to affect the uk and ultimately large parts of the world from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. liberation day as the white house grandly calls the unveiling of its new trade policy is finally upon us. but what it actually means and what the impact will be is still not clear, as president donald trump keeps businesses and world leaders waiting until wednesday to unveil the next round of tariffs. while mr trump has suggested all nations will be hit with additional levies and sir keir starmer has admitted the uk is unlikely to escape the new measures its still far from certain exactly which industries will bear the brunt this time, with steel, aluminium and auto parts already subject to additional import costs. heres a look at whats already known, what could happen, and what investors are doing as uncertainty reigns. the top end of the uk stock market has performed relatively well this year, considering concerns over growth, inflation, still-high interest rates and the wider geopolitical landscape. the ftse 100 is up more than 5 per cent year-to-date, in contrast to the us sp 500 being down around the same amount. the uncertainty has hit smaller businesses more, with the ftse 250 down 5.2 per cent in 2025 and the aim all-share index down 4.3 per cent. more recently, while there was a sell-off on monday ahead of these new tariffs, it eventually wasnt as steep as had initially looked the case and tuesday saw investors buying once more on price weaknesses, perhaps hinting that some saw limited further downside in share price terms, even with new tariffs to come. it has always been a fools game at guessing the stock markets most immediate, very next move, but aj bell analysis notes that while the biggest tech stocks in america the so-called magnificent seven have lost a combined 2.3 trillion in the first quarter of this year, they have strong growth prospects well into the future and that status makes them natural candidates to attract widespread buying when markets are more upbeat. in the uk, defence stocks in particular have fared strongly so far, with a domestic political strategy based on increased spending in this area pushing share prices higher while the price of gold, a traditional safe haven for investors, has repeatedly hit new record highs this year and is predicted by some analysts to rise even further across 2025. price hikes and job losses could have a total global economic toll of 1.4 trillion 1.1 trillion under the worst-case scenario according to aston business school. that is if full global retaliation with reciprocal tariffs is the eventual outcome, which would see the us economy in particular hit. naturally, if the entire planet is affected to that scale, the uk wouldnt be exempt, but theres still scope for changing trade paths, perhaps seeking out partners to increase back-and-forth business with if a reliance on the us is no longer plausible. quite aside from the businesses involved, government spending could also be impacted. last week, rachel reeves noted the government was laying out savings to restore 9.9bn of headroom for government expenditure. one assessment of a worst-case scenario involving trump tariffs and the uk suggests that would be entirely and immediately wiped out. david miles, from the office for budget responsibilitys obr budget responsibility committee, told mps if tariffs at 20 25 per cent were put on the uk and maintained for five years, our assessment of what that does is that it will knock out all the headroom that the government currently has. had we made that a central forecast, and had the government not changed policy at all knowing that we were going to take that as our central forecast, then the headroom would have pretty much all gone. mr miles noted the improbability of the extreme scenario, which would include a term beyond the next us presidential elections, but the obr further noted the hit to business confidence across the uk caused by the uncertainty around tariffs and other costs. at the other end of the scale, theres the perspective that some changes could in fact mean the uk might actually benefit from a trade war. again, its important to note thats on a broad, all-encompassing term there would still be businesses or industries negatively affected within that. but the obr noted that if the uk avoided involvement in a trade war, reciprocal tariffs and the like, some redirected trade flows could end up increasing business this side of the water. much of that is based around the fact that the uk-us trade deficit is far more reasonably balanced than, for example, the eu-us one. professor irina surdu-nardella, of warwick business school, told cnbc tariffs could yet have a limited impact on the uk. effects would be relatively limited to industries such as fishing and mining, ms surdu-nardella said, pointing to the service-focused nature of the uk economy meaning much of it would be unscathed by import tariffs. of course, theres also the possibility that mr trump and mr starmer find an agreement whereby british companies end up entirely unaffected by the whole process, potentially giving them a foothold to gain further business with overseas customers. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see

journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. britain must prepare for the worst from new import tariffs, the foreign secretary david lammy said yesterday as the world awaits the start of donald trumps trade war. the united states president has threatened to impose fees of 20 per cent or more on imports from around the world with immediate effect in measures expected to be announced on wednesday which he has dubbed liberation day. global market jitters continued over the potential impact of a trade war, as one study estimated it could cost the world 1.1 trillion. in britain alone, 25,000 jobs are at risk according to the institute of public policy research ippr, which said the new white house trade policy would completely destabilise the uk car manufacturing industry. meanwhile, goldman sachs analysts expected britains gdp to suffer a greater hit than previously feared even if a uk trade deal were agreed, due to larger negative spillovers from tariffs levied against the european union. as a result, the bank now expects 0.8 per cent of uk growth this year and 1.2 per cent in 2026 down from 0.9 and 1.3 respectively. chancellor rachel reeves told a cabinet meeting that there would be a serious impact from the tariffs. and while business secretary jonathan reynolds tried to be optimistic about the prospect of a uk-us deal, he was unable to give a timeline on when one might be completed. ministers were also forced to deny the trump administration was making demands about free speech in the uk as part of any potential trade deal. mr trump has previously announced a 25 per cent tax will be introduced on all cars imported to the us. he has also announced similar tariffs on steel and aluminium. however, the announcement on wednesday is expected to be far more wide-ranging. as the world braces for the impact, ireland warned it could lose up to 80,000 jobs under a worst-case scenario. in the house of commons, mr lammy said intense conversations were still taking place on a possible economic agreement. liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesperson calum miller asked if britain should enter talks with the eu on a customs union to soften the blow of tariffs. mr lammy replied its hugely important at this time that we continue the intense conversations were having with the us administration on getting an economic agreement but of course we prepare for the worst all options remain on the table, as the prime minister indicated. earlier, tory leader kemi badenoch had admitted she has not tried to use her relationship with senior white house figures, such as vice-president jd vance, to avoid tariffs. researchers at the ippr warned that employees at jaguar land rover and mini are some of the most exposed to a potential trade war. some 16.9 per cent of uk car exports were to the us last year, representing a total of more than 101,000 units worth 7.6bn. ippr research fellow pranesh narayanan said trumps tariffs have huge potential to completely destabilise the uk car manufacturing industry, affecting tens of thousands of jobs and putting the governments growth plans in jeopardy. meanwhile, a new study from the aston business school in birmingham estimates a global trade war could cost 1.4 trillion 1.1 trillion. the research maps six escalating scenarios, starting with us tariffs on canada, mexico and china, through to full global retaliation, with associated wider losses. earlier, sir keir starmer told sky news the likelihood is there will be tariffs. nobody welcomes that. we are obviously working with the sectors most impacted at pace on that. nobody wants to see a trade war but i have to act in the national interests. he said he hoped the deal being negotiated with the us would mitigate the tariffs. asked if he had been played by mr trump amid his efforts to build a good relationship, the prime minister said the us is our closest ally. our defence, our security, our intelligence are bound up in a way that no two other countries are. so its obviously in our national interest to have a close working relationship with the us, which weve had for decades, and i want to ensure we have for decades to come. he said talks on an economic deal would normally take months or years but in a matter of weeks we have got well advanced in those discussions. the pm is willing to offer us big tech firms a large tax cut in a bid to avoid tariffs, according to the guardian. the uk government is said to be considering reducing the headline rate of its digital services tax dst and to broaden its scope to include companies from other countries, a move which would represent a significant concession to us tech firms. the tax currently imposes a 2 per cent levy on tech firms, including us giants such as amazon, meta, alphabet, ebay and apple and generates about 800m a year. if it is lowered and applied to other countries it could satisfy mr trump, who has complained about the impact that dsts are having on us firms. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Tariffs live: Trump unveils 10% reciprocal tariff on imports from UK and 20% on EU in global trade shake-up
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-02 22:38:20)
  Content: donald trump has announced a reciprocal tariff of 10 on britain from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to

reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. donald trump slapped a 10 per cent tariff on us imports of uk goods as he set out sweeping trade levies hitting countries across the world. the us president said his liberation day announcement was a declaration of economic independence. mr trump confirmed that from 5am on thursday a 25 per cent tariff would be imposed on all foreign cars imported to the us a move which experts fear could cost 25,000 jobs in the british car industry. and he indicated tariffs of 10 per cent would apply to other products from the uk the same level as the global baseline he was setting for countries around the world. other blocs with higher tariffs on us goods were hit with tougher import taxes, including 20 per cent for the european union. sir keir starmers government hopes to strike an economic deal with the white house which will mitigate the impacts. but chancellor rachel reeves acknowledged the uk would not be out of the woods even if a deal could be reached. mr trump predicted foreign presidents, prime ministers, kings, queens, ambassadors and everyone else would soon be calling him to ask for exemptions from the tariffs. italian prime minister giorgia meloni said mr trumps new tariffs were wrong, and that she hoped to work with the us and europe to avoid a trade war that would weaken the west. the prime ministers office hinted at relief that the announcement wasnt worse. a downing street source said we dont want any tariffs at all, but a lower levy than others vindicates our approach. it matters because the difference between 10 and 20 is thousands of jobs. we will keep negotiating, keep cool and keep calm. we want to negotiate a sustainable trade deal, and of course to get tariffs lowered. tomorrow we will continue with that work. no immediate retaliatory measures are expected from the government as it focuses on trying to strike the hoped-for economic deal with the us. but experts say more than 25,000 uk car manufacturing jobs could be at risk from the 25 tariff on cars. there is no justification for us tariffs that will hit ireland, irish premier micheal martin said. the taoiseach said ireland believes in open and free trade and that the imposition of tariffs is bad for the world economy. i deeply regret the us decision to impose 20 tariffs on imports from across the european union. we see no justification for this. mr martin said now is a time for dialogue, and i believe that a negotiated way forward is the only sensible one. a confrontation is in no ones interests. uk steel has called for a significant intervention to help the industry out of a crisis. director general gareth stace said three weeks ago, president trump delivered a cataclysmic strike to uk steel exports for us manufacturers. the new 10 tariffs, stacked on top of the existing 25 levies, are not only sticking the knife in again, but this time turning it in the wound for maximum effect. the uk government must continue its efforts to strike a deal with the us, but we recognise that this requires willingness from both sides. we cannot afford to wait any longer as our exports are being damaged, and our market is being undercut by rising imports. uk steel has warned that the steel crisis has been deepening for some time and bold, decisive and significant interventions are needed now. shadow trade secretary andrew griffith has described the tariff announcement as disappointing news and suggested that brexit spared the uk from higher import taxes. he called on the government to agree a fair deal with the us for the benefit of businesses and consumers, saying this is disappointing news which will worry working families across the country. the chancellors emergency budget of just a week ago with its inadequate headroom is now at risk, casting uncertainty about more taxes or spending cuts. sadly, it is british businesses and workers who will pay the price for labours failure. he added the silver lining is that brexit, which labour ministers voted against no less than 48 times, means that we face far lower tariffs than the eu a brexit dividend that will have protected thousands of british jobs and businesses. the prime minister will face some brickbats for failing to win a carve out from tariffs with what many see as a fawning approach to donald trump and his rightwing white house administration. but as the world digests the stunning news of reciprocal tariffs unleashed around the globe, sir keir starmer can take some satisfaction from his work and have hope that for the uk at least there is a quick resolution to this nightmare. as downing street was quick to point out, the 10 per cent minimum tariff being imposed on the uk is much better than others, most notably the eu. this literally is the difference between saving and losing many thousands of jobs. there have been positive noises from downing street that despite issues around free speech concerns from the us, the uk and america are close to a trade deal which would even see these tariffs go away. there is though a very much wait and see on that. so while starmer and his ministers can take some satisfaction now from their efforts there is still a lot of work ahead and high stakes. these tariffs wipe out the chancellor rachel reeves economic headroom. a failure to get rid of them will leave the uk government in a lot of trouble. the society of motor manufacturers and traders branded the new tariffs deeply disappointing. mike hawes, chief executive, said the announced imposition of a 10 tariff on all uk products exported to the us, whilst less than other major economies, is another deeply disappointing and potentially damaging measure. our cars were already set to attract a punitive 25 tariff overnight and other automotive products are now set to be impacted immediately. while we hope a deal between the uk and us can still be negotiated, this is yet another challenge to a sector already facing multiple headwinds. these tariff costs cannot be absorbed by manufacturers, thus hitting us consumers who may face additional costs and a reduced choice of iconic british brands, whilst uk producers may have to review output in the face of constrained demand. trade discussions must continue at pace, therefore, and we urge all parties to continue to negotiate and deliver solutions which support jobs, consumer demand and economic growth across both sides of the atlantic. business secretary jonathan reynolds said the united states was our closest ally and the government would remain calm and committed to doing a deal to mitigate the impact of the tariffs announced by donald trump. uk manufacturing body make uk reportedly says the 10 tariffs will be devastating for british exporters. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Reams of documents related to L.A. County sex abuse cases never turned over, lawyers say
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:11:23)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article illustrates aspects of the Principal-Agent Problem within the context of public institutions. The county (the principal, representing the public interest) delegates authority to its probation staff (the agents). The text highlights alleged failures of the agents (abuse) and a potential failure of the principal (the county) to adequately oversee, document, and respond to these actions over decades, as evidenced by the discovery dispute and the large settlement payout. This suggests a breakdown in the mechanisms designed to ensure agents act in the best interest of the principal and those they serve.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative around AB 218 and subsequent legislative proposals (like SB 577) reflects elements of Agenda-Setting Theory. The large volume of lawsuits enabled by AB 218 (an event/policy) has forced the issue of institutional liability and financial burden onto the legislative agenda, prompting lawmakers to propose new bills aimed at managing the fallout. The framing by Senator Laird about 'restoring equilibrium' suggests an attempt to shape the public and legislative perception of the problem and the proposed solution.

  Content: thousands of documents that could contain key details about rampant childhood sexual abuse inside a defunct santa clarita detention camp including so-called grooming drawings were left scattered inside the facility and never turned over to the victims attorneys, according to a firm suing l.a. county over the decades-old incidents. as part of the preparation for a looming june trial, attorneys with law firm manly, stewart finaldi had arranged april 15 to visit camp scott, a shuttered l.a. county probation camp where many of their clients say they were sexually abused as children. inside the facility were reams of records that the county should have turned over to the firm more than a year ago through discovery, said attorney courtney thom, whose firm has about 150 civil cases alleging sexual abuse by county probation staff. you can understand my shock when im walking through where my clients got raped as children, and there are documents everywhere, thom said at a monday superior court hearing in downtown los angeles. thom said she discovered thousands of paper grievances, a locked file cabinet labeled personnel files camps a w, and a drawing she believed was signed by thomas jackson a probation deputy accused by at least 20 women of sexually assaulting them at the camp. the drawing, included in a court filing, was of the name tami in big, block orange letters and appeared to be signed by a jackson. t. attorney james sargent, who is representing the county and accompanied thom for the tour last week, called her claims inflammatory and incorrect. they want to air what they deem as dirty laundry, said sargent, who told l.a. superior court judge lawrence riff that the personnel files they discovered had nothing to do with the staff named in the lawsuits. nor did the drawing, he said. tami wilson, a former supervisor at the camp, told him she recalled being given the hand-drawn card by a youth, he wrote in a court filing. the county announced earlier this month they planned to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of alleged sexual abuse inside the countys juvenile facilities and foster homes. the settlement believed to be the largest sex abuse settlement in u.s. history arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to file civil suits against alleged predators and the agencies that employed them. a handful of prominent firms including manly, stewart finaldi declined to participate in the settlement and have ongoing litigation. in the aftermath of ab 218, state legislators have introduced several bills to attempt to make it easier for governments and school districts to deal with the financial fallout from the deluge of suits. one of these bills sb 577 is set for a hearing tuesday. the bills author, state sen. john laird, said the legislation is intended to restore some equilibrium, lessening the financial blow to public agencies while still upholding a victims right to sue. county lawyers claim one reason the state law change has had such a devastating financial toll is because many of the records they need to fight decades-old cases are long gone. attorney john manly argued the claim flew in the face of what his firm saw at camp scott. the county has been telling all of sacramento that they dont have any documents, said manly, who urged the judge to allow his firm to publicize the footage theyd taken of the heaps of documents. we need to be able to share this with legislators. riff agreed with the countys request that the videos from inside camp scott remain confidential for now due to security risks, though he instructed both sides to try to find some common ground on whether certain videos could be made public. though camp scott hasnt been used to house youths for years, sargent wrote in a filing that may soon change. l.a. county superior court judge miguel espinoza ordered the county friday to prepare to shut down los padrinos juvenile hall the countys last remaining juvenile hall, where roughly 270 youths are held due to problems stemming from chronic understaffing. the youth presently in los padrinos will need to go somewhere, and if some wind up at camp scott, the public release of photos and videos could be seriously detrimental, sargent wrote. thom noted that both reporters and television crews have been allowed to broadcast footage taken inside the camp, including a 2001 documentary, camp scott lock-up. the l.a. times has been in there to photograph, said thom. mtv videoed more than we did.

afford it. donald trump is preparing to unveil a raft of new tariffs on wednesday afternoon in what the president has repeatedly billed as liberation day. trump has promised to roll out reciprocal dollar-for-dollar tariffs on nations that levy duties on u.s. goods as part of an aggressive attempt to fulfill his administrations america first agenda and correct years of what he deems unfair trade. international markets wait tentatively as the president is expected to unveil his plans at 4 p.m. wednesday at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden at the moment american markets close. plans remain under wraps with trumps team reportedly weighing options through tuesday. however, white house press secretary karoline leavitt stated that the president had already decided his course of action and that the tariffs would go into effect almost immediately. the only way to avoid the new levies, she said, is to move production to the u.s. it follows the liberal candidate for a critical seat on the wisconsin supreme court, susan crawford, who defeated conservative brad schimel in a race seen as a referendum on trump and his billionaire adviser elon musk. former republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is on board with an effort by democrats in the upper chamber led by senators tim kaine, amy klobuchar, and mark warner to end donald trumps made-up emergency that the president has declared against canada allowing him authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on the u.s.s northern neighbor. trump claims the authority by declaring a national emergency caused by the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migration from canada as well as mexico and china. president trump is saying that there is an emergency with canada. canada is a friend, not an adversary. canada is a sovereign nation, not a 51st state, senator kaine of virginia said on tuesday. this morning, cnns haley talbot reports that the list of republicans who will vote yes on a tariffs resolution up for a vote today at around 7 p.m. has grown to include the former gop leader of the senate. kaine said he approached mcconnell last night and didnt even get to the question before the kentucky senator said im with you. other republicans in support of the move to at least symbolically rebuke the president on his trade policy just a few hours after his liberation day announcement on reciprocal tariffs expected to cover a large swathe of u.s. trading partners include senators susan collins, lisa murkowski, and rand paul. senator thom tillis also told cnn that he doesnt plan on voting for kaines resolution, but has some concerns with the trade policies being discussed, adding, we need to see what comes out tomorrow wednesday and be instructed by that before we take action. earlier, trump wrote in part on truth social mitch mcconnell of kentucky, susan collins of maine, lisa murkowski of alaska, and rand paul, also of kentucky, will hopefully get on the republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize canada for the sale, into our country, of large amounts of fentanyl, by tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy. they are playing with the lives of the american people, and right into the hands of the radical left democrats and drug cartels. the senate bill is just a ploy of the dems to show and expose the weakness of certain republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the house will never approve it and i, as your president, will never sign it. after breaking the record for the longest senate speech in history, cory booker now seems to have broken the internet, with a slew of praise, memes and even tiktok videos commemorating his mammoth achievement. the new jersey democrat took to the senate floor on monday evening, saying he would remain there as long as he was physically able. the speech lasted a whopping 25 hours and 5 minutes. mike bedigan looks at some of the online reactions. it was fitting that cory booker was recounting a story about the late civil rights leader john lewis as he entered the 19th minute and 24th hour of a historic speech to the senate on tuesday evening. in that moment, the first black senator for new jersey broke a record for the longest speech ever made in congress, one that was set 67 years ago by the segregationist democrat strom thurmond, who spoke for a day and a night in opposition to the civil rights act. overcome with emotion, booker looked up to the ceiling and touched his heart as his fellow democrats in the chamber applauded his effort. one of msnbcs morning joe hosts is delighting in the fact that the wisconsin supreme court candidate backed by elon musks lost - even after the tech mogul dumped millions into the race. wisconsin voters elected liberal justice susan crawford to the states supreme court on tuesday, beating brad schimel by more than 200,000 votes in the most expensive judicial election in u.s. history. the vote keeps the high courts 4-3 liberal majority intact. musk repeatedly played up the stakes of the election, claiming it will direct the destiny of humanity and the future of the world is at stake. now, morning joe host joe scarborough is reveling in the massive loss musk suffered. katie hawkinson reports from washington, d.c. the u.s. has sent a three-person team to myanmar to help respond to the 7.7-magnitude earthquake, in a move criticized as weak and irrelevant by a former aid official.

governments official target and down from a 0.9 forecast made by the group in october. the economy expanded by a modest 0.7 in both 2024 and 2023. it managed to achieve 0.1 growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the previous three months, after stagnating in the third quarter. most analysts do not foresee any significant rebound in the near term. confindustria indicated that while its forecasts accounted for the already-announced u.s. tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as what it termed record levels of uncertainty regarding trade policy, they did not consider the effects of an escalating trade war. in a worst-case scenario, with permanent 25 u.s. tariffs on all imports, rising to 60 for china, coupled with retaliatory measures against u.s. exports, italys growth could decline to around 0.2 this year, it said. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Trump steps back from cliff edge of global trade war - BBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-10 00:17:31)
  Content: for days, donald trump and his white house team had insisted they were fully committed to their decision to impose sweeping reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries. they even derided a report on tuesday that said the president was considering a 90-day pause news that triggered a brief stock market surge. but now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality. the reordering of the global economic order is on hold, and trumps promise of a golden age of american manufacturing will have to wait. the white house has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along. weve had more than 75 countries contact us, and i imagine, after today, there will be more, treasury secretary scott bessent told reporters shortly after the announcement. that framing from the white house is not surprising, of course. and it is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market and growing chorus of republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement. so was it a strategic retreat in the face of unexpected resistance, or yet another example of trumps art of the deal negotiating strategy at work? it didnt take long for trumps aides many of the same people who said he would never back down to fan out and celebrate the presidents move. trade adviser peter navarro said trumps tariff situation unfolded exactly the way it should. you clearly failed to see what president trump is doing here, press secretary karoline leavitt told a crowd of gathered reporters. the entire world is calling the united states of america. they were less clear about the details of trumps tariff suspension, announced via a post on his truth social website. did the reprieve in higher tariffs apply to the eu? were mexico and canada, which had avoided the original 10 baseline tariffs, somehow now included? were tariffs targeting specific sectors affected? ultimately, the white house provided some clarity on these questions but for hours us trading partners were left to scrutinise trumps truth social post and glean details from answers to questions shouted by reporters at press gaggles. on wednesday afternoon, trump acknowledged that the markets had looked pretty glum and that people were getting a little queasy a reflection that undercut some of the bravado he expressed over the past week and could hint at the real reason for his tariff change of course. earlier in the day, he was on truth social, urging people to be cool! and promising that everything is going to work out. and on monday he lashed out at what he called panicans - a party based on weak and stupid people who werent patient with his efforts. in the end, it was trump who made an abrupt change of course. he insisted, however, that his tariff announcement was one that had to be made, and that any economic disruptions reflected a sickness that had been allowed to fester in the american economy. democrats, meanwhile, painted a less rosy picture. senate minority leader chuck schumer accused trump of governing by chaos. he is reeling, he is retreating, and that is a good thing, he said. in the end, the thought process behind trumps decision may not really matter. the reality is that the us is now making nice or at least nicer - with nations that had faced their retaliatory trade fire, even though trump is still imposing a 10 across the board tariff that by itself would have been huge news just a few weeks ago. it is enough of a step down for the stock market to bounce back, however, and trump is now leaning into a trade war with china which he hit with 125 tariffs. that will have global economic repercussions of its own, but it is more in line with recent american foreign policy - including that of democratic president joe biden - as it seeks to constrain chinese ambitions. the big unknown, however, is whether trumps actions over the past week setting allies scrambling and threatening the established global order will have made such a strategy more difficult to pursue. and in 90 days, when trumps pause expires, this weeks economic drama and uncertainty could begin all over again. follow the twists and turns of trumps second term with north america correspondent anthony zurchers weekly us politics unspun newsletter. readers in the uk can sign up here. those outside the uk can sign up here. six people have been confirmed to have died following the crash near to the new jersey side of the hudson. the us government admitted kilmar abrego garcia was deported to el salvador due to administrative error. five of the individuals on board were a family of tourists from spain and the sixth person was the pilot, officials say. news of the us presidents plan to halt higher-band taxes came as a surprise on wednesday, but was it part of a plan?

  Content: this is an edition of the atlantic daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. sign up for it here. late last month, jonathan braun was arrested on allegations of shoving a 3-year-old, causing a red mark on his back and substantial pain. this is only his latest brush with the law over the past four years. he was banned by federal and new york state judges from working in debt collection fined 20 million and accused of punching his wife and father-in-law, groping a nanny, and attacking a nurse with an iv-bag holder. he also allegedly threatened a man at his synagogue who asked him to pipe down during services. this crime spree is stunning, but what makes it national news is that it has all happened since 2021, when president donald trump commuted brauns 10-year prison sentence for smuggling marijuana. braun, granted clemency during the last hours of trumps first term as president, is one of many recipients of a trump pardon who has found himself back in trouble with the law. some of them are people convicted of serious offenses on january 6, 2021, and then pardoned at the outset of trumps second term in office. despite trumps depiction of the rioters as peace-loving patriots, more than a few of them have proved to be repeat offenders. braun, who is now back in prison , is not the only first-term recipient of clemency to be rearrested. eli weinstein, a convicted ponzi schemer who received a last-minute 2021 commutation, was convicted on march 31 in a 41 million fraud case. philip esformes, whose sentence for his role in a 1.3 billion medicare fraud was commuted in 2020, was arrested last year on domestic-violence-related charges, but the state dropped them a month later. the rapper kodak black has also been repeatedly arrested since receiving a commutation. but the group of people convicted in connection with january 6 has been particularly likely to have found more trouble. former proud boys leader enrique tarrio, who was sentenced to 22 years for seditious conspiracy and other crimes, was arrested for assault just a month after being pardonedat the capitol, no less. d.c. prosecutors declined to pursue charges. he also tried unsuccessfully to stir up conflict at a conference of trump critics in february. matthew huttle, an indiana man who received a pardon for entering the capitol on january 6, was fatally shot by a deputy on january 27 after reaching for a gun. emily hernandez, a missouri woman, was convicted for causing a fatal drunk-driving crash in 2022 the sentencing came days after her pardon for january 6 offenses. andrew taake of texas was pardoned in january, then arrested in february on an outstanding charge for allegedly sending explicit messages to an undercover cop he believed was an underage girl. its not just that clemency recipients have been accused of crimes since their pardons theyve also tried to use the pardons to get off for other offenses. edward kelley argued that his pardon from trump for january 6 also covered his plot to kill the fbi agents who investigated him a judge disagreed. daniel ball said that charges of illegally possessing a gun should be thrown out because the weapon was discovered in a search related to now-pardoned january 6 charges, and the acting u.s. attorney agreed , but dan wilson, a pardoned capitol rioter who made a similar argument, had less luck with a federal appeals court. other defendants have made similar claims, with varying results . david daniel, who was charged with producing and possessing child pornography, also argued that a search that turned up the material was invalid because of his january 6 pardon, but the u.s. attorney in the case disagreed . daniel has pleaded not guilty to the charges. seeing so many people who received pardons get back in trouble with the law should be deeply embarrassing for trumpthough to be fair, pardoning people for a violent assault on the capitol should have been embarrassing to him as well. he is not the first president to issue clemency for personal reasons, but presidential administrations usually carefully administer commutations and pardons, in part to avoid recidivism. the trump white house, however, has shown little regard for the process. last month, it fired justice department pardon attorney elizabeth oyer after she opposed restoring gun rights for the actor mel gibson, then tried to block her from testifying to congress. trump, the first convicted felon to serve as president, has long claimed that he will restore law and order in america, but his definition is highly selective. some of the presidents commutations and pardons are simply favors granted to people who are well connected, but in the case of the january 6 commutations, he was eager to reward loyalty and to make a political point that he and they had both been subjects of political persecution. this creates a nauseating contrast with statements this week in which administration officials have claimed that kilmar abrego garcia, a maryland resident living under protected legal status who was deported to el salvador, is a terrorist, despite a total lack of evidence and despite the fact that the government has previously acknowledged his deportation was an administrative error . the search for some offense to pin on abrego garcia is also being done to make a political point. if trump is eager to find dangerous criminals, he could do so more easily by looking at his pardon list. related here are four new stories from the atlantic todays news 1. a federal judge found probable cause to hold the trump administration in contempt over its willful disregard of his

  Title: Trump warned US economy to be hit hardest by tariff war: Live updates - The Independent
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 15:31:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Realism, one might interpret the trade policy discussions as reflecting a state-centric view where national economic gain is prioritized, potentially at the expense of global stability. The text notes the 'aggressive tariff plans' and the claim that they 'would produce great benefits for american workers' while simultaneously acknowledging the negative impact on 'nearly all countries' and the risk of 'global recession'. This aligns with a realist perspective where states pursue self-interest in a competitive international system, viewing economic interactions through a zero-sum lens.; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory appears relevant in examining how specific issues gain prominence. The article highlights media reports (NBC News, Bloomberg, BBC) focusing on the Hegseth information leak and the economic consequences of tariffs, alongside official statements (Leavitt on student loans, Vance on tariffs, Bessent on China). This suggests that the selection and emphasis of these topics by both media and officials shape the public agenda, potentially diverting attention from or amplifying certain narratives over others.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents conflicting or potentially erroneous naming conventions for administration officials. Textual Basis: It refers to a 'press secretary karoline hegseth' and later 'white house press secretary karoline leavitt', and mentions 'treasury secretary scott bessent' immediately after discussing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a way that could cause confusion. Significance: Such inconsistencies, if not simple typos, could suggest reporting errors or a lack of clarity in official communication, potentially impacting the perceived reliability of the information presented. Probing Questions: Are these naming variations indicative of reporting inaccuracies, and how might such details influence a reader's trust in the overall narrative? What does the juxtaposition of the Defense Secretary and Treasury Secretary discussions imply about the article's structure or underlying connections the author perceives?

fund, told the bbc on tuesday. the u.s. economy will be one of the hardest hit by the aggressive tariff plans, the imf warned earlier in the day as it slashed forecasts for global economic growth, with the u.s. dropping to just 1.8 percent, from a previous forecast of 2.7 percent. the global economic growth forecast was cut by half a percentage point, with downgrades in nearly all countries amid ongoing uncertainty from the trump administrations trade policy. this came after vice president jd vance admitted that president donald trumps aggressive tariff increases will profoundly change the u.s. economy and other nations. in a speech in india, vance said the rebalancing from aggressive tariffs would produce great benefits for american workers. earlier, gold prices surged to a record high while the value of the u.s dollar plunged, following trumps latest attack on the federal reserve chair jerome powell. press secretary karoline hegseth was asked about embattled defense secretary pete hegseth at todays white house briefing. she told reporters that president donald trump continues to stand behind hegseth. white house press secretary karoline leavitt has announced that the education department will resume involuntary collections for defaulted student loans on may 5th. they will recoup loans and go after tax refunds, federal pensions and even their wages, of those who owe money. if you take out a loan, you have to pay it back very simple, leavitt said. defense secretary pete hegseth pulled the airstrike information he posted into signal chats with his wife, brother and dozens of others from a secure communications channel used by u.s. central command, raising new questions as to whether the embattled pentagon head leaked classified information over an open, unsecured network. nbc news first reported that the launch times and bomb drop times of u.s. warplanes that were about to strike houthi targets in yemen details that multiple officials have said is highly classified were taken from secure u.s. central command communications. a person familiar with the second chat confirmed that to the associated press. press secretary karoline leavitt confirmed president donald trumps upcoming travel plans at todays white house briefing. the president will depart washington, d.c., on friday to travel to rome for the funeral of pope francis on saturday, returning that evening. from may 13-16, the president will travel to saudi arabia, qatar, and the united arab emirates all key allies in the gulf. this thursday, norways prime minister jonas gahr stoere and finance minister jens stoltenberg will meet with trump at the white house. president donald trump has said that the u.s. stands strong with india against terrorism, after todays deadly attack in kashmir. read more about the attack here former vice president al gore lashed out at the trump administration in a fiery speech about the climate crisis, comparing its attempts to create their own preferred version of reality to that of adolf hitlers third reich. ariana baio reports from new york. kenneth rogoff, a former chief economist of the international monetary fund, says that if president donald trump doesnt retreat on his tariffs, the chance of a u.s. recession and subsequent global recession is almost 100 percent. rogoff was speaking to bbc radio 4s pm programme in the u.k. today. defense secretary pete hegseth doubled down during a tuesday morning fox and friends interview, insisting that the information on airstrike launches and bomb drop times that he shared with his wife, brother, and dozens of others in two separate signal chats was not classified. hegseth didnt deny the existence of a separate chat instead, he attacked the media and his former staff, whom he accused of leaking information about the chats. his repeat denial comes as nbc news reported tuesday that the information hegseth posted came directly from secure communications from the head of u.s. central command, gen. erik kurilla. the pentagons inspector general is investigating the chats. the material kurilla sent included details about when u.s. fighters would take off and when they would hit their targets details that could, if they fell into the wrong hands, put the pilots of those fighters in grave danger. but he was doing exactly what he was supposed to providing hegseth, his superior, with information he needed to know and using a system specifically designed to safely transmit sensitive and classified information. but then hegseth used his personal phone to send some of the same information kurilla had given him to at least two group text chats on the signal messaging app, three u.s. officials with direct knowledge of the exchanges told nbc news. the sequence of events, which has not previously been reported, could raise new questions about hegseths handling of the information, which he and the government have denied was classified. in all, according to the two sources, less than 10 minutes elapsed between kurillas giving hegseth the information and hegseths sending it to the two group chats, one of which included other cabinet-level officials and their designees and, inadvertently, the editor of the atlantic magazine. one of them was composed of hegseths wife, brother and attorney and some of his aides. treasury secretary scott bessent told a closed-door investor summit tuesday that the tariff standoff with china is unsustainable and that he expects the situation to de-escalate, bloomberg reports. bessent made the remarks at a jpmorgan chase event on the sidelines of the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings in washington, d.c. he added that negotiations between the u.s. and china have not yet started but that a deal is possible, according to people who attended his session, which wasnt open to the public or media. u.s. stocks rose after his comments, with the sp 500 index gaining as much as 2.9 as of 1228

  Title: Bank of England rate-setter says US tariffs likely to push down on inflation
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 11:13:59)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article touches upon aspects of Realism in international relations, specifically concerning trade and tariffs. The US imposing tariffs on the UK, as mentioned in the text ('the us has imposed a 10 import tariff on goods coming from the uk, a policy which also applies to many other countries'), exemplifies a state acting in its perceived self-interest to protect its economy, regardless of the impact on other nations. This action, and the UK's subsequent economic considerations, reflect the competitive and often conflictual nature of international trade relations as described by Realist theory.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents Megan Greene's analysis of potential disinflationary effects of US tariffs on the UK, but also acknowledges 'a tonne of uncertainty around this.' This uncertainty, coupled with the mention of 'both inflationary and disinflationary forces,' suggests a more complex and potentially volatile economic situation than a simple cause-and-effect narrative. What specific factors contribute most to this uncertainty, and how might they interact to produce unexpected economic outcomes?; Intriguing_angles: The opening section discusses the importance of 'parsing out the facts from the messaging' in the context of US politics, while the latter part focuses on economic analysis of UK inflation. This juxtaposition, while seemingly unrelated, could subtly imply that economic narratives are also subject to manipulation or biased framing. To what extent might political messaging influence the interpretation and presentation of economic data, and what mechanisms might facilitate such influence?

  Content: in a live qa, the independents chief political commentator john rentoul fielded readers questions on trumps trade war, its global consequences, and the uks options for navigating this latest storm from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. donald trumps declaration of liberation day a dramatic unveiling of sweeping new tariffs on us imports has reignited questions about americas global role, its economic influence, and what it all means for britain post-brexit. with the uk hit by a 10 per cent tariff, compared with 20 per cent for the eu, some brexiteers were quick to claim a win. but if being slightly less penalised by a volatile us president is the best economic case for brexit, its a shaky argument. theres still no comprehensive uk-us trade deal, and experts warn that the so-called brexit dividend has yet to materialise. in a live qa for the independent, i answered your questions on trumps trade war, the uks response, and whether keir starmer can steer a better course with the eu. we discussed soft power, chlorinated chicken, the single market, and whether china really stands to gain. what emerges is a picture of a world in flux and a uk still feeling its way through the fog of brexit and global disruption. heres what you asked during the ask me anything event and how i answered. q trump calls this liberation day but is he actually pushing the world away from the us dollar and undermining americas soft power? a that is an interesting question. i dont think trump is completely detached from reality, but he is certainly good at pretending that bad news is just a blip in the prelude to making america rich again. i think that now he has impressed his voters with the idea that he is standing up for them against foreigners, many of the tariffs will be dropped, with trump proclaiming huge concessions and unprecedented trade deals as cover. there was an interesting, if depressing, study of the effect of tariffs during trumps first term they were mostly selective and short-lived, but they made a lot of his rust-belt voters slightly worse off. the study found that the voters worst affected were those most in favour of tariffs. q time to talk with the eu and be nice to them this time, surely? a keir starmer is talking to the eu and trying to be nice to them, because it made sense before trumps trade war to ease the friction on uk-eu trade as much as possible without rejoining the single market and if we had rejoined the single market, we might have been hit by the eu tariff of 20 per cent, so there is a genuine brexit dividend in the form of being hit less hard than the eu. ministers have been pretty robust about chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef. jonathan reynolds, the trade secretary, said yesterday that the government would abide by labours clear manifesto position to maintain that regime namely food production standards. although i personally dont have a problem with us chicken or beef, provided it is clearly labelled. q how might the uk go about capitalising on this with our eu neighbours? a it is an opportunity in the sense that the uk will be hit less hard, and may be able to mitigate some of that damage by having eu-based companies that export to the us move here, but it is the opposite of an opportunity in any other sense of the word! q is there any point in the uk trying to negotiate with trump? a i think we should do both negotiate and not retaliate. i think he will reverse on tariffs at some point, and if he needs a great trade deal to cover his retreat, that should be fine by us. q if rejoining the single market makes economic sense, why wont starmer act especially with a huge majority and brexit now a minority view? a a counterintuitive question, at a point when not being in the single market means the uk faces 10 per cent tariffs on us exports instead of 20 per cent! but generally it remains true that we would be better off in the single market, while, for some voters, sovereignty is more important than gdp. politically, though, labour trying to reverse brexit would lose a chunk of voters without gaining any, because those who are pro-eu are voting labour anyway unless the lib dems can use the issue to force labour voters to switch to them. q is he a genius wholl help the us at the worlds expense or the opposite, bringing harm to everyone? fishingintheriveroflife a trump is good at selling a simple political message, which is that he is going to stop those cheating and pillaging foreigners from taking advantage of the us. how much he believes in the economics of protection is almost a meaningless question. it is worth remembering that british politicians such as joseph chamberlain thought that tariffs were a good idea, and the issue split the uk and uk parties for decades, even though free trade usually had the upper hand. chamberlain thought tariffs were a terrific wheeze because they would raise a lot of money and allow the abolition of income tax or so he thought. q if china play their cards well, could they come out on top in the end? a no. everyone loses from a trade war. but in relative terms, chinas rise to world economic domination will continue. it does not need any action on the part of the chinese government chinese companies will respond to market incentives and try to sell where they do not face tariffs. q can you explain what tariffs we already levy on imports from the usa? trump said 10 per cent is that correct? a no, the 10 per cent is not correct. i have heard jonathan reynolds, the trade secretary, say that the average tariff the uk charges on imports from the us is 4 per cent. we impose tariffs on goods including beef, cars and denim jeans. before trump, the average us tariff on uk goods was about 3 per cent, according to the world trade organisation. every respectable economist that i have seen has said that the so-called formula used by the ustr us office of the trade representative is nonsense. just because it uses greek letters doesnt make it formal economics. it is like a supposedly scientific equation in a shampoo advert. what the formula does is roughly relate the tariff rate to the size of a countrys trade surplus with the us with a minimum of 10 per cent. so that countries that sell more to the us than they buy from it have higher tariffs. the uk imports about the same as it exports, which is why it is on the lowest rate of 10 per cent. these questions and answers were part of an ask me anything hosted by john rentoul at 1pm bst on friday 4 april. some of the questions and answers have been edited for this article. you can read the full discussion in the comments section of the original article. for more insight into uk politics, check out johns weekly commons confidential newsletter. the email, exclusive to independent premium subscribers, takes you behind the curtain of westminster. if this sounds like something you would be interested in, head here to find out more. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: The World Reacts With Caution to US 'Reciprocal' Tariffs Against Dozens of Nations
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-02 22:55:26)
  Content: bangkok ap the sweeping new tariffs announced wednesday by u.s. president donald trump were met initially with measured reactions from key trading partners, highlighting the lack of appetite for a full-fledged trade war. trump presented the import taxes, which he calls reciprocal tariffs and range from 10 to 49, in the simplest terms the u.s. would do to its trading partners what he said they had been doing to the u.s. for decades. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, he said. but it is not going to happen anymore. the president promised that jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country. he framed it not just as an economic issue, but a question of national security that threatens our very way of life. financial markets were jolted, with u.s. stock futures down by as much as 3 early thursday and tokyos market leading losses in asia. oil prices sank more than 2 a barrel and the price of bitcoin dropped 4.4. nobody wants a trade war shortly after trumps announcement, the british government said the united states remains the u.k.s closest ally. business secretary jonathan reynolds said the u.k. hoped to strike a trade deal to mitigate the impact of the 10 tariffs on british goods announced by trump. nobody wants a trade war and our intention remains to secure a deal, said reynolds. but nothing is off the table and the government will do everything necessary to defend the u.k.s national interest. italys conservative premier giorgia meloni described the new 20 tariffs against the european union as wrong, saying they benefit neither side. we will do everything we can to work towards an agreement with the united states, with the aim of avoiding a trade war that would inevitably weaken the west in favor of other global players, meloni said in a facebook post. brazils government said it was considering taking the case to the world trade organization. and later, in a rare display of unity, brazils congress unanimously passed a reciprocity bill to allow its government to retaliate against any country or trade bloc that imposes tariffs on brazilian goods. no basis in logic some countries took issue with the white houses calculations. australian prime minister anthony albanese said the u.s. tariffs imposed on his country were totally unwarranted, but australia will not retaliate. president trump referred to reciprocal tariffs. a reciprocal tariff would be zero, not 10, said albanese. the u.s. and australia have a free trade agreement and the u.s. has a 2-to-1 trade surplus with australia. this is not the act of a friend. trump said the united states bought 3 billion of australian beef last year, but australia would not accept u.s. beef imports. albanese said the ban on raw u.s. beef was for biosecurity reasons. the 29 tariff imposed on the tiny south pacific outpost of norfolk island came as a shock. the australian territory has a population of around 2,000 people and the economy revolves around tourism. to my knowledge, we do not export anything to the united states, norfolk island administrator george plant, the australian governments representative on the island, told the ap thursday. we dont charge tariffs on anything. i cant think of any non-tariff barriers that would be in place either, so were scratching our heads here. new zealand also took issue with trumps tariff logic. we dont have a 20 tariff rate, said trade minister todd mcclay, adding that new zealand was a very low tariff regime and the correct figure was below the 10 baseline rate applied by the u.s. to all countries. we wont be looking to retaliate. that would put up prices on new zealand consumers and it would be inflationary, he said. spared for the moment from the latest round of tariffs were mexico and canada, so far as goods that already qualified under their free trade agreement with the united states. yet, the previously announced 25 tariffs on auto imports were scheduled to take effect at midnight. mexico president claudia sheinbaum said wednesday she would wait to take action on thursday when it was clear how trumps announcement would affect mexico. its not a question of if you impose tariffs on me, im going to impose tariffs on you, she said wednesday morning. our interest is in strengthening the mexican economy. canada had imposed retaliatory tariffs in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, imposed taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including bourbon, prompting trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. little to gain as trump read the list of countries that would be targeted wednesday, he repeatedly said he didnt blame them for the trade barriers they imposed to protect their own nations businesses. but were doing the same thing right now, he said. in the face of unrelenting economic warfare, the united states can no longer continue with a policy of unilateral economic surrender, trump said. speaking from a business forum in india, chilean president gabriel boric warned that such measures, in addition to causing uncertainty, challenge the mutually agreed rules and the principles that govern international trade. colombia president gustavo petro, who has clashed with trump before, said via x that the tariffs marked a global milestone today the neoliberalism that proclaimed free-trade policies all over the world has died. analysts say theres little to be gained from an all-out trade war, neither in the united states or in other countries. once again, trump has put europe at a crossroads, said matteo villa, senior analyst at italys institute for international political studies. if trump really imposes high tariffs, europe will have to respond, but the paradox is that the eu would be better off doing nothing, he added. villa also noted that retaliation would certainly be a further blow to the united states, but it would hurt europe even more, as the eu bloc depends more on exports to the u.s. than vice versa. on the other hand, trump seems to understand only the language of force, and this indicates the need for a strong and immediate response, villa said. probably the hope, in brussels, is that the response will be strong enough to induce trump to negotiate and, soon, to backtrack. __ ap journalists around the world contributed to this story. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: Bucking Trump tariffs, California will push to maintain global trade independently, Newsom says
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-04 14:57:41)
  Content: gov. gavin newsom announced friday that california will look for ways to expand trade and persuade international partners to exempt the state from global payback as president trumps sweeping round of tariffs has sent u.s. and global financial markets tumbling. were not scared to use our market power to fight back against the largest tax hike of our lifetime, newsom posted friday on the social media platform x. in a video , he noted that the 40 million residents of california live in the tent pole of the us economy that represents 14 of the nations gdp. newsom, a democrat who has frequently sparred with trump, said he had directed his administration to look at new opportunities to expand trade and to remind our trading partners around the globe that california remains a stable partner. california is not washington, d.c. newsom told californias international partners in a news release. the golden state will remain a steady, reliable partner for generations to come, no matter the turbulence coming out of washington. california leads the nation in manufacturing and agriculture, and tariffs could adversely affect many sectors of the states economy, from the tech industry to the ports. but its unclear exactly how newsoms efforts to carve out exemptions would work or whether a state can forge such exceptions. a newsom administration official said on background that nations have wide latitude to shape and target retaliatory tariffs. in a news release, the governors office said that it would work to pursue collaborative opportunities with trading partners that protect californias economic interests and the broader supply chains linked to the states economy. the administration, it said, will explore ways to support job creation and innovation in industries reliant on cross-border trade, promote economic stability for businesses and workers impacted by federal trade disruptions and safeguard access to critical supplies, such as construction materials needed for recovery efforts following the devastating los angeles firestorms. kush desai, a white house spokesman, responded by saying, gavin newsom should focus on out-of-control homelessness, crime, regulations, and unaffordability in california, instead of trying his hand at international dealmaking. newsom has no ability to dissuade trump from his tariffs, which would likely mean fewer imports and higher prices for california, said jonathan d. aronson, a professor at usc annenberg who specializes in international trade and communications. but he might be able to persuade some nations not to retaliate against the states industries. california exports a lot of almonds and avocados, a lot of tech and electronics. it might well be something that says, hey, can you not target almonds? can you not target big tech? can you not target these things that we specialize in? aronson said he couldnt think of a precedent for newsoms initiative, which he said was creative. but he noted that it would be a tough message to pitch to china, which provides almost 30 of californias total imports. china cares about only one country, which is china, he said. how much attention would the chinese pay to this? who knows? still, aronson said, even if newsoms pitch is unlikely to move some global payers, it might help if california can persuade some nations that are retaliating to be more targeted. everybody else is not targeting california theyre targeting the united states, and california is getting caught in the wash, aronson said. so, to the extent you can persuade others that were still a good place to deal with and wouldnt you like to come here youve still going to do business with the united states, because were so big if youre going to deal with that, were a reliably sane state. stock markets worldwide plummeted friday after china matched trumps significant raise in tariffs in an escalating trade war. on thursday, the sp 500, dow jones industrial average and nasdaq composite all reached their lowest one-day drops since the economy tanked at the outset of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020. the tariffs hit some of californias top trading partners. trump imposed additional duties of 24 on japan, 25 on south korea and a 34 tariff on china, on top of a 20 tariff applied to that nation over illegal imports of the deadly drug fentanyl. canada and mexico were excluded from both the baseline and reciprocal tariffs, which could ease the effect at the nations grocery stores. most u.s. produce imports come from mexico and canada, including avocados, cucumbers and mushrooms. but the countries still face 25 levies on certain goods and 25 tariffs on imported cars and light trucks. car buyers across south california scrambled this week to make purchases ahead of the tariffs. its going to have a huge, huge impact on manufacturing and supply chains throughout throughout california, economist kevin klowden of the milken institute in santa monica told the times on thursday. we dont have the specialized manufacturing for all of these supply chains, and certainly not at cost in the u.s. trump said the new tariffs represent a turning point globally and for the united states. he dubbed wednesday liberation day, and said it would forever be remembered as the day that american industry was reborn, the day americas destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make america wealthy again. our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not going to happen anymore. its not gonna happen, trump said. this is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in american history. its our declaration of economic independence. over the last decade, california has made concentrated efforts to establish itself nationally and internationally as a beacon of liberal resistance to the administration. during trumps first term, california sued his administration about 120 times over four years, often with success. in the months of trumps current term, california atty. gen. bontas office has joined other states in rekindling that legal fight, challenging the administration on presidential actions on the environment, immigration, voting rights, education policy, dismantling federal agencies and programs and other issues. for years, california leaders have made efforts to establish relationships with foreign leaders and local government officials in other nations, separate from whatever administration occupies the white house. both newsom and former gov. jerry brown entered into agreements with other countries on climate policies, efforts accelerated because of trumps hostility to international environmental cooperation during his first term. after taking office in january, trump withdrew the u.s. from the paris agreement, an international climate accord in which nations worldwide agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to limit global warming. during a trip to the vatican in 2024, newsom met with political leaders in italy to sign a memorandum of understanding on addressing climate change. on a trip to asia last fall, the california governor reached similar agreements with china, the provinces of guangdong and jiangsu, and the municipalities of beijing and shanghai. california also has reached accords with regional governments in canada, mexico, japan, south korea, sweden and norway, among others. since taking office in 2019, newsom also has met personally with former canadian prime minister justin trudeau, chinese president xi jinping and other national leaders. times staff writers michael wilner, laurence darmiento and the associated press contributed to this report.

  Title: Spain unveils €11bn plan to reach long-delayed Nato defence spending target
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-22 13:24:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: Spain's increased defense spending, spurred by pressure from NATO and the perceived threat from Russia ('vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security'), aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize their security in an anarchic international system. This action demonstrates a shift towards self-reliance and power balancing within Europe.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Spain's commitment to increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP, but also mentions criticism from coalition partners who describe the plans as 'incoherent and absolutely exorbitant.' This suggests internal political divisions regarding defense priorities and resource allocation. What are the specific concerns of the coalition partners, and how might these internal disagreements affect the implementation and effectiveness of the defense plan?
  Key Entities Mentioned:
    - ukraine:

      > Snippet: the enemies of europe are not just using missiles as we have seen in ukraine over the past three years, he said.

      > Snippet: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year
  Content: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year, saying it has become obvious only europe will know how to protect europe from now on. the country which lags well behind other western nations by dedicating about 1.3 of its gdp to defence spending is one of the nato members that has been pressured by the trump administration to increase its spending, and had previously committed to hitting the 2 threshold by 2029. but speaking on tuesday morning, spains prime minister, pedro sánchez, unveiled a 10.5bn 9bn industrial and technological plan for security and defence that will allow spain to meet the 2 commitment in 2025. sánchez said the plan, which has been approved by his cabinet and will now be submitted to the eu and nato, was needed to address the current and future defence challenges. its main focus will be telecommunications, cybersecurity and buying military equipment. the enemies of europe are not just using missiles as we have seen in ukraine over the past three years, he said. theyre also using unmanned drones and paramilitary forces to sabotage supply chains and to cut gas lines and underwater cables. theyre using social networks to issue disinformation and to polarise people and spread disaffection towards democratic institutions. theyre using ai cyber-attacks and quantum computers to compromise out telecommunications, our supply networks, and our public services in order to target our way of life. the prime minister who pointed out that his administration was finally making good on the 2 commitment pledged by its conservative predecessor in 2014 said the new plan would help reinforce european security in record time. in a world thats dominated by uncertainty, europe is hope and it is certainty and that certainty must be protected by strengthening our security and defence systems because given whats going on, its obvious that only europe will know how to protect europe, he added. and spain will contribute to protecting europe. sánchez said vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security, no matter how far any eu member state was from the frontlines of the conflict in ukraine. the security and stability of ukraine, of eastern europe and the baltic and nordic countries, is also the security and the safety of spain, he said. the people who live in those countries know that putin is serious and that his words are backed by deeds and thats why they look to europe for protection. theyre looking for something important, and that is unity. spain will not be indifferent to that demand. ukraine resists, europe responds and spain fulfils its obligations. sánchez also repeated his assurances that the additional spending would not lead to increased taxes, raids on the welfare state budget, or deficit increases. the plan has faced criticism from coalition partners in the leftwing sumar platform, who described the plans as incoherent and absolutely exorbitant. in january, donald trump increased pressure on nato, claiming the us had shouldered the global defence burden for too long and saying he would ask all nato members to increase defence spending to 5 of gdp. the nato secretary-general, mark rutte, has urged member states to use the threats from washington as an incentive to take unilateral action on raising defence contributions. last month, rutte said the pressure was already paying off in countries such as spain, portugal, belgium and italy. i tell them that, well, now i am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2 by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2 because we have to spend much, much more than 2 but now i am calling you, but you might get a very, erm, patient man from washington on the line if you dont listen to me, he said.
