  Title: Police seize enough fentanyl ‘to kill everyone in Portland twice,’ arrest 46 in multi-agency trafficking crackdown
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-22 23:31:33)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article highlights a state-level response (law enforcement agencies) to a perceived threat (fentanyl trafficking) originating from a non-state actor (Sinaloa Cartel) across international borders. This aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize security and power in an anarchic international system. The quote 'our partnership with local, state, and federal agencies makes our collective response stronger' exemplifies the state's attempt to consolidate power to address the threat.; Intriguing_angles: The article emphasizes the success of the operation and the collaboration between agencies, but it doesn't delve into the root causes of the drug crisis or the social factors contributing to drug use and trafficking. This omission could be a deliberate choice to focus on the immediate law enforcement response rather than addressing the more complex underlying issues. What are the long-term strategies to address the root causes of drug trafficking and addiction in Portland?

  Title: SURVEY: Half Americans Have Given Up On Saving Money...
  Source: studyfinds.org (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights the prevalence of financial insecurity among Americans, influencing public perception and potentially shaping policy priorities. The repeated emphasis on savings shortfalls and reliance on savings for emergencies, "67 of americans feel theyre lagging behind their savings targets. even worse, 47 have completely given up hope," frames the issue as a widespread problem. This can lead to increased public concern and demand for solutions.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Gen Z's relatively high satisfaction with their banks (71%) but also their willingness to switch (45%). This juxtaposition is intriguing because it suggests a potential disconnect between perceived satisfaction and actual loyalty. What specific factors, beyond those mentioned, might be driving Gen Z's willingness to switch banks despite their reported satisfaction? Could this indicate a deeper dissatisfaction with certain aspects of banking services that aren't fully captured by the satisfaction metric?

  Title: Many 'snowbirds' in USA looking to pack up and fly north -- for good...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism is relevant here. The article illustrates how a shift in the U.S. administration's policies and rhetoric, specifically "steep trade tariffs" and "suggestions that canada should become a u.s. state," directly impacts Canada's economic and social well-being. This aligns with Realism's emphasis on states acting in their self-interest and the pursuit of power, leading to a competitive and sometimes conflictual international environment. The resulting "chill that has blanketed relations" and the economic consequences for both countries demonstrate the core tenets of Realist thought.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that some Canadians are "quietly preparing to let go of their second homes" but "holding back to see how things play out." This suggests a level of uncertainty and a potential for further shifts in behavior depending on future political developments. What specific political or economic indicators are these Canadians monitoring, and what threshold would trigger a more widespread exodus?; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the economic reliance of South Florida on Canadian snowbirds, stating they "either own property and pay property tax or rent for the winter months - either way, a boost to the economy." However, it doesn't quantify the overall economic impact or explore potential mitigation strategies. What percentage of South Florida's economy is directly attributable to Canadian snowbirds, and what alternative revenue streams are being considered to offset the potential loss?

  Content: by doyinsola oladipo and mrinalika roy reuters -the number of canadian snowbirds planning to sell their second homes in sunny florida and arizona has surged this spring, many of them put off by the sudden chill that has blanketed relations between their homeland and the u.s. real estate agents say they are seeing more canadians cashing out, further softening property prices in warm-weather states that have long attracted retirees and tourists from cold and snowy canada. canadians spent close to 6 billion on u.s. real estate from april 2023 to march 2024 - making up 13 of all foreign transactions - more than any other nationality, according to data from the national association of realtors. nearly half of the homes purchased by canadians were for vacation purposes, with florida, arizona and hawaii ranking as the top markets. last week, tracy and dale mcmullen sold their vacation home in buckeye, arizona, a property they owned for five years. the alberta residents, who usually spend four to five months in arizona a year, said they are not planning to come back. we decided to sell the property after the current potus took office, said dale, referring to u.s. president donald trump, who was inaugurated for the second time in january. it was time to leave. we felt we could not trust what he might do next to us as individuals and to our country. we no longer felt welcome nor safe. canadians are feeling stung by the actions and words of the trump administration, which has imposed steep trade tariffs on its northern neighbor, threatening canadas export-dependent economy. trumps repeated suggestions that canada should become a u.s. state, and his derogatory references to now-former prime minister justin trudeau as governor have annoyed canadians and offended their national pride. as a result, many canadians are boycotting u.s.-made goods, such as bourbon and produce and canceling trips to u.s. destinations. canadian return flights from the u.s. fell 13.5 in march from a year earlier, according to statistics canada. canadian-resident return trips by automobile fell about 32. real estate is now facing a similar pullback in demand. laurie lavine, a realtor in arizona who helped the mcmullens with their sale, told reuters that he currently has 18 listings from canadians looking to sell, compared with the usual two to four per quarter. trade friction and the current weakness of the canadian dollar are also contributing to the pullback, lavine said. canadians are also feeling picked on, with u.s. border agents enforcing stricter rules on entering the country, he added. beginning this month, the trump administration is requiring all foreigners 14 or older to register and submit fingerprints if they stay beyond 30 days. canadians, who previously could visit for up to six months without a visa, are subject to the new requirement. the sour feelings that many canadians suddenly feel toward the u.s. are having a big impact on the property market in florida, one of the closest warm-weather states to ontario and quebec, canadas most populous provinces. south floridas residential market has for decades been reliant on the annual influx of canadian snowbirds who either own property and pay property tax or rent for the winter months - either way, a boost to the economy, said ermengarde jabir, a director of economic research at moodys analytics. the first quarter is typically the peak buying season for condominiums in the region, coinciding with when many snowbirds are in town, said andrea hartmann, managing partner of the sandy hartmann group, a real estate firm in the tampa bay area. since the beginning of the year we have not received an offer from a canadian buyer even once, and normally we would, she said. floridas housing market is already reeling. prospective buyers have faced rising insurance premiums, concerns over climate change and a series of devastating hurricanes in recent years. in the tampa-st. petersburg-clearwater region, mortgage lock volume for second homes - or the number of buyers securing rates ahead of purchases - fell 25 on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2025, according to optimal blue, a mortgage technology and data company. now with the political issue, the cost of maintaining a place here in florida and the insurance, a lot of them decided to sell and go, said ken obrian, owner of southwest coast realty in naples, which has specialized in helping canadians purchase properties in florida for about 20 years. there is no incentive to come to the states anymore, said donny b., a native of ontario who is looking to sell his two investment properties in florida. like many snowbirds interviewed for this story, he declined to give his surname, saying he feared backlash. he said he decided to sell because of the political uncertainty, the exchange rate and concern about whether floridians would still welcome canadians in the current climate. i got down here on wednesday and i was nervous. im like, are people going to be pissed off at me? other states have started to see an exodus as well. agents in los angeles and palm springs, california, are working with canadian sellers who are quietly preparing to let go of their second homes, said fatima malik, global real estate advisor at engel volkers beverly hills. some are holding back to see how things play out, but others are already shifting their sights toward places like portugal, mexico, and parts of france, she added. reporting by doyinsola oladipo in new york and mrinalika roy in bengaluru editing by frank mcgurty and paul simao

  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article highlights how the collaboration between Takashi Murakami and the Dodgers, along with the MLB Tokyo Series, successfully captured public attention. The text states, "the overall success of the tokyo series collection delighted murakami" and "i was surprised by the overwhelming response." This suggests that the media coverage and marketing efforts surrounding the event effectively placed it on the public's agenda, leading to increased interest and demand.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions the merchandise hitting the secondary market for four times the purchase price. This suggests a potential imbalance between supply and demand, and raises the question: Was the limited availability of the merchandise intentional to drive up prices and create hype, and if so, what are the ethical implications of such a strategy?; Intriguing_angles: The article notes Murakami's surprise at the overwhelming response in Japan, stating, "honestly, i had thought baseball wasnt as major a sport in japan these days." This suggests a potential disconnect between the artist's perception and the reality of baseball's popularity in Japan.

  Title: 'He embraced all people': Californians mourn a pope who shared their values, brought excitement to church
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-21 18:51:44)
  Content: catholics across california mourned the death of pope francis on monday, paying tribute to his modernization of the roman catholic church and steadfast commitment to the poor and marginalized. francis, the first pontiff from latin america, never visited california. but he forged a close bond with the more than 5 million catholics who live in los angeles, largely because he nudged the church to a more tolerant position on social issues by urging compassion for immigrants, arguing for tolerance of gay people and advocating for action on climate change. i have to say what im feeling today is very personal, the archbishop of los angeles, josé h. gomez, told a crowd of nearly 2,000 mourners and tourists who poured into a noon mass at the cathedral of our lady of the angels in downtown los angeles. im going to miss him big time. francis, the catholic churchs 266th leader, made history when he became the first latin american pontiff in 2013. born in 1936 in argentina to italian immigrants, he was also the first pope to take his papal name from st. francis of assisi, a saint who dedicated his life to serving the poor. gomez said francis was like a wise father, a big brother. the fact that he was from a latin american country and the first pope to speak spanish meant a lot to people in that part of the world, including immigrants in l.a. it was very special to us, gomez, who was born in monterrey, mexico, said after the afternoon mass. for us, it was a clear manifestation of the presence of the church in our countries and sense of joy knowing that we are an important part of the life of the church. outside the cathedral, which serves the largest population of catholics in the united states, mourners lay bouquets of red and white roses, white lilies and pink carnations monday morning at the feet of a mosaic of the virgin of guadalupe. inside, cynthia cook and her mother, julieta camacha, offered their silent prayers as cathedral bells rang overhead. i was just in shock, because i thought he was recovering, cook said of francis. the day before, she had watched news reports of francis giving the traditional easter blessing sunday from the balcony of st. peters basilica in the vatican. cook said francis embodied a love for everyone. as the head of the catholic church, he put it out that immigrants are gods children, she said. a tear wells up in the eye of a parishioner maria rodriguez at cathedral of our lady of the angels in downtown los angeles during a noon mass on april 21, 2025. jason armond los angeles times . in riverside, isabel torres prayed to god and asked for his guidance after the end of a packed morning mass at queen of angels catholic church. torres, who works at the church as a cleaner, said she was very sad when she found out about francis death. but at the same time, she said in spanish, i thanked god for the time he gave us with him. a mexican immigrant, torres saw francis as a reflection of god and an example for the way the catholic community should live, primarily through humility. she particularly appreciated how francis urged compassion for migrants. with the help of god almighty, i hope the death of the pope touches the hearts of these presidents, torres said. and that they see us all the same and that they understand we have the right to this world, no matter the race or color. immigrants across southern california valued francis constant emphasis on the right to migrate, said the rev. thomas p. rausch, emeritus professor of catholic theology at loyola marymount university in los angeles. its a fundamental human right, but its not one always appreciated by government, rausch said. after holding mass at queen of angels chapel, the rev. benediktus obon said he hoped the new pontiff would continue the legacy left behind by francis. he was a man of peace, obon said. he loved humanity. he embraced all people, and didnt care who you were. we are all creatures of god. obon acknowledged the role francis played in changing the negative narrative surrounding the catholic church before he took over as pope. his presence in the church brought lots of good things, obon said. he also brought lots of people back to church. for the community, this is a big loss. for obon, it was important that the next pope carries out the criticism of the current u.s. administrations treatment of immigrants that francis carried out until the last day of his life when he met with vice president j.d. vance. see them as human beings first, see them as part of yourself in other people, he said. a parishioner at cathedral of our lady of the angels in downtown los angeles kneels before a portrait of pope francis during a noon mass. jason armond los angeles times just months after assuming the papacy in 2013, francis took his first official trip outside rome to visit the italian island of lampedusa to focus on the plight of migrants and asylum seekers. we have this enormous number of people on the move today, fleeing poverty, injustice, war, violence, and hes shown a real concern for that, rausch said. francis also used his platform to urge tolerance for gay

  Title: Republican backlash to Trump tariffs grows as Senate rebels decry ‘bad policy’
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-03 17:29:12)
  Content: the first signs of an internal us political backlash against donald trumps declaration of a global trade war are starting to emerge amid tanking stock markets worldwide, including on wall street, and widespread international criticism of the move. hours after trump unveiled a sweeping panoply of tariffs in an event he dubbed liberation day, four republican senators openly defied him by voting for a senate resolution from democrats demanding that the 25 tariffs on canadian products be reversed. the resolution lacks the force of law but its support from mitch mcconnell and rand paul, both of kentucky, susan collins of maine, and lisa murkowski of alaska, immediately signaled the deep misgivings among some republicans over trumps tariff gambit, which has triggered a global sell-off. mcconnell, the former senate majority leader, issued a scathing denunciation after wednesday evenings vote, calling tariffs bad policy that would trigger economic hardship. trade wars with our partners hurt working people most, he said in a statement. tariffs drive up the cost of goods and services. they are a tax on everyday working americans. further criticism came from trumps former vice-president, mike pence, who called the tariffs the largest peacetime tax hike in us history. these tariffs are nearly 10 times the size of those imposed during the trump-pence administration, and will cost american families over 3,500 per year, he posted. the four republicans who voted with democrats did so despite a public appeal from trump not to support the resolution, tabled by tim kaine, a democratic senator for virginia who was hillary clintons running mate in the 2016 presidential election, which trump won. the resolution was aimed at curtailing the powers trump claimed under the international emergency economic powers act, which he has invoked to tackle the uss 1.2tn trade deficit and, in the case of canada, cited the influx of fentanyl through its border. mcconnell pulled no punches in his attack on trumps policy. preserving the long-term prosperity of american industry and workers requires working with our allies, not against them. with so much at stake globally, the last thing we need is to pick fights with the very friends with whom we should be working with to protect against chinas predatory and unfair trade practices, he said. he added at a time when americans are tightening their belts, we would do well to avoid policies that heap on the pain. we ought to strengthen our friendships abroad, and reinforce our allies as pillars of american prosperity and security. paul, his fellow kentuckian, said the tariffs were unconstitutional. our constitution was very specific that taxes tariffs are a tax taxes originate in the house, come to the senate and then go the president, he told reporters. they dont just go to the president and no one else. what kind of system would it be if all of our taxes and laws were passed by one person? he later told fox news trade is proportional to wealth. the last 70 years of international trade has been an exponential curve upwards, and the last 70 years of prosperity has been upwards also. we are richer because of trade with canada, and so is canada. collins, the senator for maine, said tariffs would damage lobstering, agriculture and the pulp and paper industries in her state, which borders canada. she also lambasted imposing tariffs on us allies. the fact is, the vast majority of fentanyl in america comes from the southern border rather than from canada, she said on the senate floor. one of my biggest concerns is we should be distinguishing between allies and our adversaries and not treating them the same way. murkowski, a senator from alaska, said tariffs would also hurt her state and urged trump to find a better way to mutually secure our borders and address fentanyl trafficking than by starting a trade war. while not all canadian trade practices are fair, im keenly aware of the negative impacts in store for alaskan families and businesses should tariffs drive up the costs of essential goods, she posted on x. in alaska we share more than 1,538 miles of border with canada. we are friends, neighbors, partners, and allies when it comes to our economies, our mutual defense, our cultures, and, yes, our trade. the outspoken republican criticism hinted at a wider unease in the party that is mostly being kept muted for fear of repercussions from trump. thom tillis, a republican senator for north carolina, warned about potential irreparable damage to his farming constituents before wednesdays announcement. anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right need to talk to my farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy, he told cnn. they dont have time. so weve got to be crisp on this implementation. john thune, the republican senate majority leader, tried to reconcile his concerns with loyalty to trump. ive got my issue. i represent a state that is very dependent upon exports, he told reporters. but i do appreciate the presidents focus on making sure were getting better deals, and giving business an incentive to do business here in the united states. such equivocation contrasted with unambiguous condemnation from democrats, some of whom openly lauded the republican anti-tariff rebels. this is what happens when people speak up, posted the new jersey senator, cory booker, citing images of news headlines about the four senators votes and obliquely referencing his record-breaking senate floor speech this week denouncing trumps policies. chuck schumer, the democratic leader in the senate, posted 54 tariffs on china, 10 tariffs on iran, 0 tariffs on russia alongside a puzzled emoji. brian schatz, a hawaii senator and the democrats chief whip, posted ive never seen a president ruin the economy on purpose. responding, chris murphy, the outspoken connecticut senator who has emerged as an articulate advocate of the need for a democratic anti-trump fightback, wrote this is the thing to understand. its all on purpose. creating chaos and crisis.

  Title: Travel to USA from almost everywhere falling under Trump...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-19 16:31:36)
  Content: overseas travel to the united states has declined sharply since president donald trump returned to office. industry experts say some of the reasons are plain to see reports of detentions and deportations, including the weeks-long lockup of european tourists, have sowed fears of bad experiences at the border. some countries have tightened travel advisories, and trumps whiplash tariffs have ratcheted up international tensions. last month, the number of overseas visitors fell nearly 12 percent compared with the same time last year, according to data from the international trade administration, an agency under the u.s. department of commerce. the downturn, after a 2 percent decline year-on-year in february, is the first meaningful drop since travel plummeted in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. if sustained, the decline could translate to billions of dollars in lost tourism revenue, industry experts project. some would-be travelers are nervous about the trump administrations policies. others are enraged by his rhetoric. some have doubts about their safety. the european union has begun to issue its u.s.-bound officials burner phones, for fear of surveillance, the financial times reported. the reaction of international travelers to avoid the u.s. is entirely predictable, said adam sacks, president of tourism economics, an industry research firm. the combination of policy and rhetoric that has been so divisive and combative and isolationist each successive policy and related polemics have been making the situation worse. the drop in visitors from certain countries and regions is especially stark. according to the international trade administration data, there were 17 percent fewer visitors from western europe in march, 24 percent fewer from central america and 26 percent fewer from the caribbean compared with a year ago. the agencys data, which relies on i-94 forms that travelers submit at the border as basic arrival and departure records, covers non-u.s. citizens and nonimmigrants from overseas staying one night or more, including for vacation, for business or to visit family. the data is considered preliminary because it does not contain figures for canada and mexico, which have not yet reported their data to the international trade administration. after canada and mexico, the largest share of travelers typically hail from france, germany, italy, spain, britain, japan, south korea, china, india, australia, brazil and colombia. visitor numbers from nearly all of these countries dropped in march. the number of travelers from colombia shrank by 33 percent, germany 28 percent and spain 25 percent year on year. instead of heading to the u.s., many europeans are opting to travel regionally instead, sacks said. over time, they may choose canada, mexico or the caribbean, he added. some fluctuations in arrivals are expected year-on-year, industry experts said easter, a major time for travel, happened in march last year but is in april this year. february was one day longer last year. so much is unknown about how much any of these things are going to factor in long-term, said michael schottey, vice president of the american society of travel advisors. theres a lot of just waiting and seeing. before trumps second term, travel to the u.s. was finally rebounding to pre-pandemic levels. the u.s. travel association, an industry group, estimates that travel injected 1.3 trillion into the u.s. economy and supported 15 million jobs last year. this years downward trend is alarming, said allison oconnor, a spokeswoman for the group. we attribute this to a variety of factors, including a strong dollar, long visa wait times, concerns over travel restrictions, a question of americas welcomeness, a slowing u.s. economy and recent safety concerns, she said. sacks said the declines are a harbinger for what were going to see the remainder of the year. it is likely getting worse. if the trend continues, he said, were looking at a decline greater than 10 percent for the year, which could amount to a projected loss in 9 billion in travel and tourism revenue. canada is the top source of international visitors to the u.s. the u.s. travel association estimates that there are about 20 million visits from canada annually, with many travelers escaping frigid winters to generate more than 20 billion in spending in states including florida, arizona and california. after trumps tariffs were announced, then-canadian prime minister justin trudeau urged citizens to instead buy domestic products and vacation within canadian borders. preliminary data from the canadian government shows that as of march, the number of canadians visiting the u.s. by car plunged by nearly 32 percent compared with the same time last year. the number of canadian residents returning from the u.s. by air declined by 13.5 percent. from mexico, arrivals to the u.s. by air dropped nearly 17 percent in march, compared with march last year. data for land arrivals the largest source of arrivals from mexico is not yet available. the administrations actions have completely turned the tide for international travel away from the u.s., sacks said. in a response to a request for comment on the downturn, the white house said trumps policies would bolster the countrys image. president trumps agenda to make america wealthy, safe, and beautiful again benefits americans and international visitors alike, anna kelly, a white house spokeswoman, told the washington post, pointing to the 2026 world cup hosted by the united states, canada and mexico, along with the 2028 summer olympics in los angeles, as moments to show all that makes america great.

  Title: World braces for 'Liberation Day' as Trump set to reveal sweeping tariffs
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-02 10:00:13)
  Content: markets and foreign capitals have braced themselves for a broad set of tariffs from president trump on wednesday, anxious for details on a dramatic shift in u.s. trade policy that is expected to supercharge the costs of cars, houses and everyday goods for americans. it is unclear whether the trump administration plans to impose a universal, baseline rate for import taxes on trading partners, or to customize tariff policy to each foreign nation, imposing reciprocal rates on a case-by-case basis. it is also unclear whether there will be any exceptions. a white house official told the times that exact details of the plan are still being perfected. the lack of clarity has rattled markets in recent weeks, driving the worst first annual quarter in three years and erasing gains on the standard poors 500 index made since trumps election victory in november. the white house said trump would announce his plans at 1 p.m. pacific time on wednesday, precisely when closing bells ring on wall street. after that, the new policy will be effective immediately, white house press secretary karoline leavitt told reporters at a tuesday news briefing. costs could rise immediately on perishable goods caught in limbo at international ports, including avocados and pineapples, said sung won sohn, a former commissioner at the port of los angeles. prices on larger items with dwindling inventories, such as foreign cars and washing machines, are likely to rise within weeks. lumber is stacked outside at the milan lumber co. in milan, n.h. robert f. bukaty associated press for los angeles, in particular, the tariffs are coming at a very bad time, sohn said. were in kind of bad shape, because you need a lot of lumber to rebuild from the fires, and the construction hasnt started yet. itll probably start in three to four months, and thats exactly when were going to be hit by higher prices for lumber. top european union leaders have alluded to potent retaliation that could extend beyond american whiskey and hit directly at silicon valley, core to the u.s. and californian economy. and californias agricultural economy the nations largest could become a target as well. retaliatory tariffs are expected to come from nations across the world affected by the new rates, risking further response from the trump administration, thus prompting a spiral into a trade war with few winners. leaders in canada, the second largest u.s. trading partner, have said ottawa will react swiftly to any new tariff actions. but mexican president claudia sheinbaum suggested tuesday that her administration will not retaliate immediately if washington slaps new taxes on mexican imports. we dont believe in an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, because that always leads to a bad situation, sheinbaum told journalists at her daily news conference. mexican president claudia sheinbaum addresses supporters at a march 9, 2025, rally at the zocalo, mexico citys main square. eduardo verdugo associated press instead, she called for further negotiations with the u.s., even while acknowledging that she has no plans to speak to trump in the coming days. the dialogue must continue, sheinbaum said. its not a matter of you put that, so ill put that, but rather whats best for mexico. shorter-term pain trumps advisors say the new policy will bring about an overdue correction, returning fair trade practices, ultimately raising significant revenue for the federal government and bringing back manufacturing to u.s. shores. it is, in many ways, the culmination of a years-long campaign by trump to increase tariffs going back to the 1980s, when as a real estate developer and celebrity, he accused japan and china of laughing at and ripping off the united states. in his address to a joint session of congress on march 4, trump complained that countries across the globe place tariffs on u.s.-made goods. on average, the european union, china, brazil, india, mexico, and canada have you heard of them? and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. its very unfair, he said. in his first term, trump negotiated a detailed trade deal, the united states-mexico-canada agreement, that replaced the north american free trade agreement and governed trade practices among the united states and its closest trading partners. susano cordoba sells peanuts to truck drivers lining up in tijuana to cross the border into the united states on march 4, 2025. gregory bull associated press but since resuming office in january, trump has repeatedly threatened new rounds of tariffs on mexican and canadian goods, often retreating from his plans at the last moment. the on-again, off-again threat of tariffs have contributed to the instability jolting stock markets, which closed on tuesday slightly up after a day of volatile trading. allies of the white house have acknowledged that short-term pain can be expected for u.s. households in the wake of the new policy implementation, which trump has referred to as liberation day. theres absolutely going to be short-term pain, republican sen. tim sheehy of montana told cnn on monday. the presidents been clear about that. everyone has. if youre going to remodel your house to make it better in the end, its going to be really annoying in the short term, when your house is getting remodeled and theres drywall dust everywhere and theres workers in your living room, sheehy added. the reality is that remodels got to happen in order to make things stronger and more stable in the back end. already, american consumers have begun to cut back on their spending and boost their savings. a friday report from the bureau of economic analysis , a government agency, showed that the personal savings rate rose 4.6 in february. consumer spending increased just .4, after decreasing by .3 in january. leavitt added tuesday that many countries have been calling the president, asking for relief from the anticipated tariffs. she said the president is open to taking their calls. its simple if you make your product in america, you will pay no tariffs, leavitt said. it is unclear how the administration will measure the success of the new tariffs. leavitt called the stock market, which has experienced volatility in recent weeks over tariff turmoil, a snapshot in time. the white house has repeatedly pointed to companies that have newly invested in the u.s. since trump took office as evidence of tariffs working. a pause on other 25 tariffs against canada and mexico is also set to expire tuesday, and the white house would not confirm whether it would be lifted. trumps announcement comes the same day that 25 tariffs were set to take effect on auto imports at 1201 a.m. wednesday. times staff writer kate linthicum in mexico city contributed to this report.

  Title: Trump announces huge new tariffs to promote US manufacturing, risking inflation and trade wars
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 20:57:51)
  Content: by josh boak associated press washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the new tariffs, coming on what trump has named liberation day, are a bid to boost u.s. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he says are years of unfair trade practices. but by most economists assessments, the move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and upend decades-old alliances. the white house is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble. april 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern american history, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said tuesday. she said the new tariffs would take effect immediately. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. based on the possibility of broad 20 tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. because trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. leavitt is among three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the associated press on first and fifth amendment grounds. the ap says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. the white house says the ap is not following an executive order to refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america.

  Content: president donald trump announces his latest tariff policy, and lawmakers in the florida house advance a proposal to reduce sales taxes in the state. president donald trump ordered the implementation of reciprocal tariffs on nations around the globe wednesday, bucking concerns from members of his own party and volatile markets to levy import taxes on billions of dollars of products that could raise consumer costs for american households by thousands of dollars a year, at least in the short term. trump said at event at the white houses rose garden that the move, which will transform u.s. trade relations with trade partners around the globe, comes on one of the most important days, in my opinion, in american history and is in response to years of the u.s. being looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations, in the presidents words. its our declaration of economic independence. for years, hardworking american citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense, trump said at the event after walking out to a backdrop of numerous american flags. but now its our turn to prosper and in so doing use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and itll all happen very quickly. during his remarks, trump held up a chart showing the reciprocal tariffs would be roughly half of the rate of tariffs he claims other countries levy on u.s. products, including 34 tariffs on imports from china and 20 tariffs on imports from the european union. but the white house has offered few details, and it was unclear where the data on the chart came from. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. the president has promised that factory jobs will return to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk causing a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on cars, clothes and other goods. the new tariffs, on a day trump dubbed liberation day, follow similar recent announcements of 25 taxes on auto imports levies against china, canada and mexico and expanded trade penalties on steel and aluminum. trump has also imposed tariffs on countries that import oil from venezuela and he plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. trump invited brian pannebecker, a retired autoworker who spoke at the republican national convention to speak briefly at his white house news conference on tariffs. my entire life i have watched plant after plant after plant close, pannebecker said. pannebecker, a michigan resident, is the founder of auto workers for trump. the influential union united auto workers endorsed democrat kamala harris in the 2024 election but has backed trumps plans to boost tariffs on imported vehicles. the florida house on wednesday took its first steps toward permanently reducing the states sales tax. the house ways and means committee advanced the bill unanimously, but it still has a long way to go. the florida house still needs to persuade the senate and gov. ron desantis that this is the right path forward. though at the moment, neither is looking too thrilled about the plan. under the bill, floridas 6 sales tax would lower permanently to 5.25. the house estimates that floridians under the bill could save around 5 billion every year. floridas sales tax has sat at 6 since 1988. the bill would also reduce sales tax on a variety of other things like commercial sales tax, electricity, and mobile homes. we are clearly setting a course, and a vision is going to provide immediate, meaningful relief to every single floridian that makes a purchase, state rep. wyman duggan said. i candidly have some concerns with the education budget as it pertains to my school district, but i feel confident will work that out in the budget silo and delivering relief to everyday floridians in a quick and effective way should be our commitment, state rep. anna eskamani said. the house, senate, and the governor all want some sort of tax relief passed this legislative session. the house wants to cut the sales tax, but desantis wants property tax. and the senate stated it is somewhere in between, though some are concerned about any permanent cuts and the potential for a subsequent budget shortfall. gov. ron desantis reacted to the special election results wednesday. specifically, the race in u.s. house district 6. the governor reiterated that he had predicted rep. randy fine would underperform president donald trumps metrics in that district and blamed the candidate himself. i think you have a candidate in randy fine who one, hes a squish, desantis said. he supported restrictions on second amendment rights back in 2018. he tried to defeat my immigration proposal to help president trump enforce immigration laws. and he tried to enact a de facto, make florida a de facto sanctuary state. and so when people see that, our base voters dont get excited about that, youre not giving them a reason to go out and vote. the governor also rejected the idea that the 15-point swing in the district since november was a referendum on trumps agenda. fine fired back at the governor wednesday, writing on social media, a dying star burns hottest before it fades into oblivion. im focused on working with realdonaldtrump to stop democrats from taking this country backwards, not working with them. lets go.

  Content: washington ap not even 24 hours after his party lost a key wisconsin race and underperformed in florida, president donald trump followed the playbook that has defined his political career he doubled down. trumps move wednesday to place stiff new tariffs on imports from nearly all u.s. trading partners marks an all-in bet by the republican that his once-fringe economic vision will pay off for americans. it was the realization of his four decades of advocacy for a protectionist foreign policy and the belief that free trade was forcing the united states into decline as its economy shifted from manufacturing to services. president donald trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the rose garden at the white house, wednesday, april 2, 2025, in washington. ap photomark schiefelbein the tariff announcement was the latest and perhaps boldest manifestation of trumps second-term freedom to lead with his instincts after feeling his first turn in the oval office was restrained by aides who did not share his worldview. how it shakes out could be a defining judgment on his presidency. the early reviews have been worrisome. financial markets had their worst week since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, foreign trade partners retaliated and economists warned that the import taxes may boost inflation and potentially send the u.s. into a recession. its now republican lawmakers who are fretting about their partys future while democrats feel newly buoyant over what they see as trumps overreach. a screen displays financial news as traders work on the floor at the new york stock exchange in new york, thursday, april 3, 2025. ap photoseth wenig mike pistillo jr., center, works with other traders on the floor at the new york stock exchange in new york, thursday, april 3, 2025. ap photoseth wenig democratic activists participated in rallies across the country saturday in the largest demonstrations since trump returned to office in january. the winds are changing, said rahna epting, who leads moveon, one of many organizing groups. he has promised that the taxes on imports will bring about a domestic manufacturing renaissance and help fund an extension of his 2017 tax cuts. he insisted thursday as the dow jones fell by 1,600 points that things were going very well and the economy would boom, then spent friday at the golf course as the index plunged 2,200 more points. the white house stayed the course saturday. this past november, america resoundingly rejected the business-as-usual policies coming out of d.c., said white house spokesman kush desai, adding, the entire trump administration is aligned on delivering on president trumps mandate to reject the status quo. a worker loads rolls of steel plate at a steel market in hangzhou in east chinas zhejiang province, monday, march 31, 2025. chinatopix via ap in his first term, trumps tariff threats brought world leaders to his door to cut deals. this time, his actions so far have led to steep retaliation from china and promises from european allies to push back. even some trump supporters are having their doubts. demonstrators hold up signs during a hands off!

  Title: Bucking Trump tariffs, California will push to maintain global trade independently, Newsom says
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-04 14:57:41)
  Content: gov. gavin newsom announced friday that california will look for ways to expand trade and persuade international partners to exempt the state from global payback as president trumps sweeping round of tariffs has sent u.s. and global financial markets tumbling. were not scared to use our market power to fight back against the largest tax hike of our lifetime, newsom posted friday on the social media platform x. in a video , he noted that the 40 million residents of california live in the tent pole of the us economy that represents 14 of the nations gdp. newsom, a democrat who has frequently sparred with trump, said he had directed his administration to look at new opportunities to expand trade and to remind our trading partners around the globe that california remains a stable partner. california is not washington, d.c. newsom told californias international partners in a news release. the golden state will remain a steady, reliable partner for generations to come, no matter the turbulence coming out of washington. california leads the nation in manufacturing and agriculture, and tariffs could adversely affect many sectors of the states economy, from the tech industry to the ports. but its unclear exactly how newsoms efforts to carve out exemptions would work or whether a state can forge such exceptions. a newsom administration official said on background that nations have wide latitude to shape and target retaliatory tariffs. in a news release, the governors office said that it would work to pursue collaborative opportunities with trading partners that protect californias economic interests and the broader supply chains linked to the states economy. the administration, it said, will explore ways to support job creation and innovation in industries reliant on cross-border trade, promote economic stability for businesses and workers impacted by federal trade disruptions and safeguard access to critical supplies, such as construction materials needed for recovery efforts following the devastating los angeles firestorms. kush desai, a white house spokesman, responded by saying, gavin newsom should focus on out-of-control homelessness, crime, regulations, and unaffordability in california, instead of trying his hand at international dealmaking. newsom has no ability to dissuade trump from his tariffs, which would likely mean fewer imports and higher prices for california, said jonathan d. aronson, a professor at usc annenberg who specializes in international trade and communications. but he might be able to persuade some nations not to retaliate against the states industries. california exports a lot of almonds and avocados, a lot of tech and electronics. it might well be something that says, hey, can you not target almonds? can you not target big tech? can you not target these things that we specialize in? aronson said he couldnt think of a precedent for newsoms initiative, which he said was creative. but he noted that it would be a tough message to pitch to china, which provides almost 30 of californias total imports. china cares about only one country, which is china, he said. how much attention would the chinese pay to this? who knows? still, aronson said, even if newsoms pitch is unlikely to move some global payers, it might help if california can persuade some nations that are retaliating to be more targeted. everybody else is not targeting california theyre targeting the united states, and california is getting caught in the wash, aronson said. so, to the extent you can persuade others that were still a good place to deal with and wouldnt you like to come here youve still going to do business with the united states, because were so big if youre going to deal with that, were a reliably sane state. stock markets worldwide plummeted friday after china matched trumps significant raise in tariffs in an escalating trade war. on thursday, the sp 500, dow jones industrial average and nasdaq composite all reached their lowest one-day drops since the economy tanked at the outset of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020. the tariffs hit some of californias top trading partners. trump imposed additional duties of 24 on japan, 25 on south korea and a 34 tariff on china, on top of a 20 tariff applied to that nation over illegal imports of the deadly drug fentanyl. canada and mexico were excluded from both the baseline and reciprocal tariffs, which could ease the effect at the nations grocery stores. most u.s. produce imports come from mexico and canada, including avocados, cucumbers and mushrooms. but the countries still face 25 levies on certain goods and 25 tariffs on imported cars and light trucks. car buyers across south california scrambled this week to make purchases ahead of the tariffs. its going to have a huge, huge impact on manufacturing and supply chains throughout throughout california, economist kevin klowden of the milken institute in santa monica told the times on thursday. we dont have the specialized manufacturing for all of these supply chains, and certainly not at cost in the u.s. trump said the new tariffs represent a turning point globally and for the united states. he dubbed wednesday liberation day, and said it would forever be remembered as the day that american industry was reborn, the day americas destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make america wealthy again. our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not going to happen anymore. its not gonna happen, trump said. this is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in american history. its our declaration of economic independence. over the last decade, california has made concentrated efforts to establish itself nationally and internationally as a beacon of liberal resistance to the administration. during trumps first term, california sued his administration about 120 times over four years, often with success. in the months of trumps current term, california atty. gen. bontas office has joined other states in rekindling that legal fight, challenging the administration on presidential actions on the environment, immigration, voting rights, education policy, dismantling federal agencies and programs and other issues. for years, california leaders have made efforts to establish relationships with foreign leaders and local government officials in other nations, separate from whatever administration occupies the white house. both newsom and former gov. jerry brown entered into agreements with other countries on climate policies, efforts accelerated because of trumps hostility to international environmental cooperation during his first term. after taking office in january, trump withdrew the u.s. from the paris agreement, an international climate accord in which nations worldwide agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to limit global warming. during a trip to the vatican in 2024, newsom met with political leaders in italy to sign a memorandum of understanding on addressing climate change. on a trip to asia last fall, the california governor reached similar agreements with china, the provinces of guangdong and jiangsu, and the municipalities of beijing and shanghai. california also has reached accords with regional governments in canada, mexico, japan, south korea, sweden and norway, among others. since taking office in 2019, newsom also has met personally with former canadian prime minister justin trudeau, chinese president xi jinping and other national leaders. times staff writers michael wilner, laurence darmiento and the associated press contributed to this report.

  Title: For US Catholics, Pope Francis' Tenure Defined by Growing Divisions
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-22 10:10:42)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article highlights how conservative organizations like EWTN and the Napa Institute have expanded their reach and influence within the U.S. Church. This is evidenced by the quote: 'according to experts, the traditional movement within the u.s. church - while not dominant in the pews - expanded its reach and influence through organizations such as eternal word television network, a catholic broadcaster, and the napa institute'. This suggests these organizations are actively shaping the narrative and priorities within the U.S. Catholic community, potentially influencing public opinion and policy debates.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions a decline in Pope Francis's favorability among U.S. Catholics, dropping from 90% in 2015 to 75% in 2024. This is a significant shift. What specific factors, beyond the broad ideological clashes mentioned, contributed to this decline? Could targeted campaigns or specific events have played a disproportionate role in shaping public perception?; Intriguing_angles: The article notes that a U.S. cardinal has never been elected Pope because the Vatican sees the U.S. as having outsized influence. This is a noteworthy statement. What specific aspects of U.S. influence are perceived as problematic by the Vatican? Does this reflect concerns about cultural dominance, financial power, or political alignment?
  Key Entities Mentioned:
    - Vatican:
      > Snippet: but a u.s. cardinal has never been elected pope, partly because the vatican sees the u.s. as having outsized influence in the church, experts said.
      > Snippet: vance and francis met briefly on sunday, hours before the popes death in what the vatican described as a cordial exchange of easter greetings.
      > Snippet: trumps victory set up instances of conflict between the white house and the vatican.
    - Donald Trump:
      > Snippet: catholics voted for trump 59-39 over democrat kamala harris, a 12 percentage point swing from 2020, according to exit polling by edison research.
      > Snippet: the growing cultural and political sway of conservatives within the u.s. catholic church was underscored by the strong support for donald trump in last years presidential elections, despite hardline policies that conflicted with those of francis.

      > Snippet: according to experts, the traditional movement within the u.s. church - while not dominant in the pews - expanded its reach and influence through organizations such as eternal word television network, a catholic broadcaster, and the napa institute, a group formed in 2010 that hosts conferences attended by clergy, business executives and political leaders, often focused on a conservative social agenda.
  Content: new headline new york reuters - when pope francis visited the united states in 2015, cheering crowds of catholics and non-catholics turned out in new york, washington and philadelphia to greet him, lifting hopes that the u.s. church was about to enter a new, vibrant era. it turned out to be a period of deep discord. in the decade since that visit, an increasingly vocal and conservative segment of the u.s. church clashed with francis over everything from immigration to climate change and same-sex couples. over time, the conservative influence helped shape opinions of u.s. catholics more broadly about 75 of u.s. catholics viewed francis favorably in 2024, down from a high of about 90 in 2015. francis died at the age of 88 on monday. the growing cultural and political sway of conservatives within the u.s. catholic church was underscored by the strong support for donald trump in last years presidential elections, despite hardline policies that conflicted with those of francis. catholics voted for trump 59-39 over democrat kamala harris, a 12 percentage point swing from 2020, according to exit polling by edison research. trumps victory set up instances of conflict between the white house and the vatican. francis called trumps plans to deport millions of migrants a disgrace, and criticized his cuts to foreign aid and domestic welfare programs. in a letter to american bishops, francis also seemed to rebut the theological concept used by vice president jd vance, who became a catholic in 2019, to justify the immigration crackdown. vance and francis met briefly on sunday, hours before the popes death in what the vatican described as a cordial exchange of easter greetings. both trump and vance expressed condolences on monday. as francis health deteriorated in his final weeks, some u.s. catholics expressed admiration for the popes legacy, portraying his papacy as one of much-needed modernization. i know he gets a lot of hate for being more progressive, said carson doss, 24, of new york. maybe its because im young but i dont have a problem with it. my parents arent the biggest fans. us church an outlier david gibson, director of fordham university center on religion and culture, a catholic university in new york, described the growing traditionalism of the u.s. church as an outlier within global catholicism and increasingly so. according to experts, the traditional movement within the u.s. church - while not dominant in the pews - expanded its reach and influence through organizations such as eternal word television network, a catholic broadcaster, and the napa institute, a group formed in 2010 that hosts conferences attended by clergy, business executives and political leaders, often focused on a conservative social agenda. those organizations and other conservative leaders at times took issue with the popes focus on topics such as climate change, while resisting his calls to limit latin mass, balking at approval of conditional blessings for same-sex couples, and bristling at his informal style. those sentiments were echoed by conservatives in the pews. i didnt really like the pope, said jeff pfaff, 39, of new yorks staten island. pfaff said he disagreed with francis stance on u.s. immigration and allowing priests to perform same-sex marriage blessings. dont shove it down my throat, he said, adding that he generally goes to church about three times a month. francis stocked the church leadership with cardinals from places that had never had them before, such as tonga, haiti and mongolia, broadening representation beyond the catholic churchs stronghold in europe. they have a similar understanding of the church as francis, a similar understanding of the mission, to care for the environment, care for migrants and refugees, and care for the excluded and the downtrodden, said tom groome, a professor of theology at boston college, a catholic institution, cautioning, however, theyre not all replicas of francis. conservative u.s. cardinals may align with similarly minded adherents of the faith from africa during the conclave in hopes of choosing a conservative to succeed francis, according to massimo faggioli, a professor of religious studies at villanova university, a catholic college in pennsylvania. the names of a few u.s. bishops have surfaced as possible contenders for pope including cardinal joseph tobin of newark, archbishop robert mcelroy of washington and cardinal blase cupich of chicago. all three were close to francis, faggioli said. but a u.s. cardinal has never been elected pope, partly because the vatican sees the u.s. as having outsized influence in the church, experts said. this story has been refiled to change the headline reporting by jessica dinapoli in new york editing by paul thomasch and suzanne goldenberg

  Title: Sanctuary States, Cities React to Trump's Federal Funding Threat

reporting on immigration and border security. he has covered immigration issues extensively, including the root causes of migration to the u.s., its impact on border communities and responses around the country. dan joined newsweek in 2024 from the independent and previously worked at the messenger, business insider and in u.k. local radio. he is a graduate of de montfort university in leicester, uk. you can get in touch with dan by emailing d.goodingnewsweek.com. you can find him on x dangooding. languages english. based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. newsweek ai is in beta. translations may contain inaccuraciesplease refer to the original content. voice is ai-generated. inconsistencies may occur. sanctuary cities and states have begun responding to president donald trumps threat of revoking their federal funding if they maintain their policies. officials in california and new york told newsweek that they will continue to protect immigrants in their communities but also made it clear they will not hinder the federal governments enforcement operations. the responses came after trump posted on truth social on thursday morning, calling sanctuary cities and states death traps. sanctuary cities and states were a target for the president during his campaign last year and in the months since his return to the white house. he and the wider republican party view them as barriers to federal immigration enforcement, while advocates say the policies protect immigrants without legal status from law enforcement overreach. withholding federal funding is not a new policy or threat from the trump administration. since january 20, the president has floated the idea over the allowance of trans athletes in school sports, and the continuance of diversity, equity, and inclusion dei policies in democratic-led states. the majority of sanctuary policies protecting immigrants are in blue cities and states. in march, four mayors testified to congress over their different sanctuary laws and policies. boston mayor michelle wu, chicagos brandon johnson, denvers mike johnston and new york citys eric adams stood firm in their beliefs that immigrants were welcome in their communities. the trump administration, including the presidents border czar, tom homan, have been clear that they want to see the end of sanctuary policies. homan has repeatedly said he believes they shield illegal immigrant criminals from federal agents. attorney general pam bondi announced lawsuits against chicago and illinois, and new york state, over their programs. a withdrawal of federal funding, worth billions of dollars for these states and cities, could drastically affect their ability to offer services from health care to education to social services. on thursday, officials in california reaffirmed that the states laws do not impede federal enforcement, and that local police and sheriff departments can work with them to catch and remove violent or serious offenders. they also told newsweek that immigrants without legal status contribute about 8.5 billion in state and local taxes each year, contributing to the welfare of their wider community. at a more local level, san francisco city attorney david chiu is already challenging the trump administration over its attempts to overturn sanctuary policies, echoing his predecessors efforts during the first trump administration. a spokesperson for adams said that all immigrants should continue to access city services, while adding that there needed to be a way for local and federal officials to work together to get violent offenders out of new york city. san francisco city attorney david chiu, in a statement to newsweek trump cannot coerce cities into taking on the federal governments immigration responsibilities. the administration wants to commandeer local police officers as federal ice agents while strong-arming local officials with threats of withholding federal funds. trump is illegally asserting rights the federal government does not have, as courts already determined during the first trump administration. eroding trust between our communities and local law enforcement will make us all less safe. the administrations actions are illegal and authoritarian, and our lawsuit seeks to put a stop to it. nyc city hall press secretary kayla mamelak altus told newsweek in a statement mayor adams has been clear that no one living in new york city regardless of their immigration status should be afraid to utilize city resources, like calling 911 or sending their children to school. but we must also find ways to work with the federal government to go after violent offenders who are taking advantage of our laws to commit crimes. we will review the executive order if and when it is filed. president donald trump, in his truth social post no more sanctuary cities! they protect the criminals, not the victims. they are disgracing our country, and are being mocked all over the world. working on papers to withhold all federal funding for any city or state that allows these death traps to exist! a spokesperson for chicago mayor brandon johnson, in a statement the city of chicago complies with all federal and state laws. mayor johnsons administration will vigorously defend chicagoans from any unconstitutional or unlawful attempts to strip residents of the funding and services they are entitled to. while these cities and states appear committed to sticking with sanctuary policies, the withdrawal of large-scale funding could have a huge impact on all of their residents. the president is yet to officially present or sign any order about the funding. newsweek is committed to

  Title: Defending Migrants Was a Priority for Pope Francis From the Earliest Days of His Papacy
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-22 10:04:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory: The article demonstrates how Pope Francis, a prominent non-state actor, repeatedly attempted to force the issue of migrant suffering onto the global political agenda, particularly by directly challenging powerful state actors like the US. The text highlights his consistent actions ('repeatedly took up the plight,' 'spoke out,' 'assailed US plans') and the reactions from political figures ('Trump... responded,' 'Homan... pushed back'), illustrating the struggle for control over the public discourse and policy focus surrounding migration, where Francis sought to elevate humanitarian concerns against dominant state security narratives.; Theories_and_interpretations: Realism vs. Humanitarianism: The conflict depicted between Pope Francis's humanitarian appeals and the actions of state actors (US, European policymakers) can be viewed through a realist lens contrasting with humanitarian principles. States are described as implementing 'increasingly restrictive policies,' 'border initiatives,' and 'mass deportations' driven by factors like 'declining public empathy' and 'public anger,' suggesting a prioritization of perceived national interests (security, border control, domestic political concerns). Francis's advocacy represents a challenge to this state-centric approach based on universal human dignity, highlighting the tension between state sovereignty/interest and non-state humanitarian norms.; Intriguing_angles: Textual Clue: The article notes Francis's meeting with Vice President JD Vance occurred 'on the day before his death,' immediately following a mention of their prior 'tangling long-distance over deportation plans.' Significance: This specific timing is presented factually but is highly suggestive, placing a final interaction with a political adversary on a contentious issue in the immediate shadow of death. It prompts consideration of the nature and potential significance of that specific, final conversation. Probing Question: What was the specific content or tone of the final meeting between Francis and Vance, and did the timing of this encounter hold any particular symbolic or substantive weight regarding their differing views on migration?; Intriguing_angles: Textual Clue: The article attributes restrictive policies to factors like 'declining public empathy' and the 'rise of the anti-immigration far-right,' presenting these as contexts for state actions. Significance: While identifying these factors, the text does not explore *why* public empathy declined or the specific mechanisms by which the 'far-right' gained influence beyond general links to migration concerns. This leaves the underlying societal and political dynamics driving these shifts largely unexamined within the narrative. Probing Question: What specific societal or political processes contributed to the described 'declining public empathy' and the 'rise of the anti-immigration far-right,' and how might understanding these mechanisms provide a more complete picture of the forces shaping migration policy?

  Content: advocating for migrants was one of pope francis top priorities. his papacy saw a refugee crisis in the mediterranean, skyrocketing numbers of migrants in the americas, and declining public empathy that led to increasingly restrictive policies around the world. francis repeatedly took up the plight of migrants from bringing asylum-seekers to the vatican with him from overcrowded island camps to denouncing border initiatives of u.s. president donald trump. on the day before his death, francis briefly met with vice president jd vance, with whom he had tangled long-distance over deportation plans. some memorable moments when francis spoke out to defend migrants july 8, 2013, lampedusa, italy for his first pastoral visit outside rome following his election, francis traveled to the italian island of lampedusa a speck in the mediterranean whose proximity to north africa put it on the front line of many smuggling routes and deadly shipwrecks. meeting migrants who had been in libya, he decried their suffering and denounced the globalization of indifference that met those who risked their lives trying to reach europe. a decade later, in a september 2023 visit to the multicultural french port of marseille, francis again blasted the fanaticism of indifference toward migrants as european policymakers doubled down on borders amid the rise of the anti-immigration far-right. april 16, 2016, lesbos, greece francis traveled to the greek island of lesbos at the height of a refugee crisis in which hundreds of thousands of people arrived after fleeing civil war in syria and other conflicts in the middle east and south asia. he brought three muslim families to italy on the papal plane. rescuing those 12 syrians from an overwhelmed island camp was a drop of water in the sea. but after this drop, the sea will never be the same, francis said. during his hospitalization in early 2025, one of those families that settled in rome said francis didnt just change their lives. he wanted to begin a global dialogue to let world leaders know that even an undocumented migrant is not something to fear, said hasan zaheda. his wife, nour essa, added he fought to broadcast migrant voices, to explain that migrants in the end are just human beings who have suffered in wars. the news of francis death shocked the family and they mourned with the whole of humanity, zaheda said. in december 2021, francis again had a dozen asylum-seekers brought to italy, this time following his visit to cyprus. feb. 17, 2016, at the us-mexico border celebrating a mass near the u.s. border in ciudad juarez, mexico, that was beamed live to neighboring el paso, texas, francis prayed for open hearts when faced with the human tragedy that is forced migration. answering a reporters question while flying back to rome, francis said a person who advocates building walls is not christian. trump, at the time a presidential candidate, was campaigning to do just that, and responded that it was disgraceful to question a persons faith. he criticized the pope for not understanding the danger of the open border that we have with mexico. oct. 24, 2021, vatican city as pressures surged in italy and elsewhere in europe to crack down on illegal migration, francis made an impassioned plea to end the practice of returning those people rescued at sea to libya and other unsafe countries where they suffer inhumane violence. he called detention facilities in libya true concentration camps. from there, thousands of migrants are taken by traffickers on often unseaworthy vessels. the mediterranean sea has become the worlds largest migrant grave with more than 30,000 deaths since 2014, when the international organization for migrations missing migrants project began counting. feb. 12, 2025, vatican city after trump returned to the white house in part by riding a wave of public anger at illegal immigration, francis assailed u.s. plans for mass deportations, calling them a disgrace. with trump making a flurry of policy changes cracking down on immigration practices, francis wrote to u.s. bishops and warned that deportations will end badly. the act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women, he wrote. u.s. border czar tom homan immediately pushed back, noting the vatican is a city-state surrounded by walls and that francis should leave border enforcement to his office. when vance visited over easter weekend, he first met with the vaticans secretary of state, cardinal pietro parolin. afterward, the holy see reaffirmed cordial relations and common interests, but noted an exchange of opinions over current international conflicts, migrants and prisoners. ___ associated press religion coverage receives support through the aps collaboration with the conversation us,

  Title: Michael Goodwin: Trump bets the White House — and GOP control of Congress — on tariffs
  Source: nypost.com (2025-04-05 20:09:02)
  Content: maybe all that winning was becoming boring. whatever the reasons that led president trump to rock the globe with his liberation day tariff regime, the immediate result has been a world of hurt for millions upon millions of americans. the stock market meltdown that wiped out some 6.4 trillion of value last thursday and friday means many households saw 10 or more of their nest eggs suddenly erased. their pain is matched only by their confusion about why the president triggered the sell-off. after all, trump 2.0 was scoring major successes by sealing the border and deporting alien criminals. the doge audit was proving his claims of massive government waste and fraud. similarly, his crackdown on columbia and other universities that allow hamas supporters to harass and intimidate jewish students is rattling the radicals where it hurts most in their multimillion dollar federal grants. meanwhile, his election provided a big boost to the economy, which has been humming along. because he has been faithful to his campaign promises, polls show trump with the highest approval rating hes ever had. his winning streak is not the only thing in jeopardy. given the tumult on wall street and in markets around the world, its reasonable to conclude that trump is betting his presidency and gop control of congress on the tariff gambit. that probably wasnt his plan, but like it not, thats how its playing out. the early returns are not promising. by 15 percentage points, voters hold a negative view of trumps handling of inflation and most oppose his emphasis on tariffs, a wall street journal poll finds. negative views of his economic stewardship outweigh positive views by 8 points, according to the survey, which was completed before markets tanked last week. public doubts about the economy are dramatic when you recall how important the subject was to trumps victory. his attacks on bidenomics and inflation became a key reason why trump swept the seven swing states and his party carried congress. yet demoralized and divided democrats now smell blood as some voters begin to sour. the disruption caused by the tariff war is so severe that jpmorgan economists predict it could take a big bite out of americas gross domestic product this year and warn that if, the tariffs remain in place, there is a 60 chance of a global recession. federal reserve chairman jerome powell, no fan of trumps to start with, said the tariffs could lead to both higher inflation and slower growth. naturally, the fear gauges are also rising among congressional republicans. texas sen. ted cruz said friday that if the tariff war pushes the us into a recession, particularly a bad recession, 2026 in all likelihood politically would be a bloodbath. you would face a democrat house, and you might even face a democrat senate. none of this is certain, of course, nor is it meant to suggest trumps goal isnt worthy. leveling global trade is admirable and a core tenet of his america first approach. he aims to protect and expand domestic manufacturing and create good, well-paying jobs by giving more companies incentives to move their headquarters and factories to the united states. its been a consistent theme since he entered politics in 2015 with a rousing denunciation of the globalists whose unfair trade practices hollowed out large industries in middle america. and he celebrated his 2024 win by hosting business titans at mar-a-lago who promised to invest in america. among them was japans softbank, whose chief executive pledged to invest 100 billion. thats the point of tariffs to incentivize companies to make their products and create jobs in the us. meanwhile, the taxes on imported products also provide washington with a source of revenue, with the white house predicting as much as 700 billion would be collected this year under the new rates, which would help fund tax cuts. if they are reciprocal, which trump insists he wants, tariffs would even the score by punishing imported goods at the same rate as countries do that impose high taxes on american products sold abroad. a prime example of the current imbalance was noted by white house adviser stephen miller why is that if you go to tokyo, theres no american cars, if you go to berlin, theres no american cars, but on our streets, we have every foreign car there is? he added theyve blocked their markets from our cars. president trump is saying that has to end. although the president has repeatedly denied it, the suspicion that the aim is to get trading partners to negotiate was effectively confirmed by trump himself friday afternoon. just had a very productive call with to lam, general secretary of the communist party of vietnam, who told me that vietnam wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s., he posted on truth social. but the first inkling of good news came just hours after china raised its tax on american products to 34, saying reciprocal levies were necessary to stop trumps bullying. subscribe to our daily post opinion newsletter! please provide a valid email address. by clicking above you agree to the terms of use and . china, of course, has long been the poster child of trade imbalances. a study from the us international trade commission reports that the sheer volume of chinas exports to the us outpaced americas exports to china by three to one in 2024. even a sneering axios concedes the facts, writing that china has a long record of trade abuses ip theft, forced technology transfers, state subsidies and market access restrictions for foreign companies. it continues the european union doesnt cheat the way china does. but it protects its own through generous agricultural subsidies and strict regulatory standards that often double as trade barriers. the vat, europes value added tax that can go as high as 27 in some countries, is another barrier on us imports. thus, with restrictive trade practices by other nations, theres often not much difference between friend and foe. leaving aside the predictable legacy media reaction to the turmoil one suspects there was glee in the new york times newsroom over the markets plunge and trumps political predicament there are also conservative skeptics. most of their doubts center on two elements the enormous size of the tariffs and the decision to unleash them all at once. some suggested that more modest rates and an industry-by-industry approach could be more effective because it would focus on specific countries and products, such as steel and aluminum. what do you think? post a comment. another argument is that onshoring cannot happen overnight. for foreign manufacturers to make a decision to relocate means building a facility in the us, hiring workers and producing goods a process that could take many months if not years. trump doesnt have years. the midterm elections are 19 months away. share your stance. please adhere to our the new pm of canada nailed it, he called for zero tariffs between canada and the us so both can become economic powers. this is part of the plan, drive new negotiations that favor the us economy and consumer. but the media wont ever admit that because of tds. im curious to what the next great t. a week of stock market activity doesnt mean that much, really. trump is trying to fix something that has been broken for years, and any change brings anxiety to people. will it work? we will have to wait and see, and the good news about tariffs is that they can be removed or lowered just as quickl. over the past couple of days i have seen videos of obama, pelosi and schumer talking about the unfair us trade tariff balance, especially with china. not one of them did anything to correct it though as it would hurt them politically. i give trump credit for at least trying to level the field. i do. i agree yes we need to fix the tarriff balance but a little at a time so as to preserve the lives of us citizens especially the elderly

  Title: Canadian demand for U.S. travel is dwindling, and that's bad news for Arizona - Axios
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-02 13:10:43)
  Content: illustration sarah grilloaxioscanadian snowbirds are likely starting to make their way home from arizona as temperatures rise, and some may not be coming back.the big picture president trumps tariffs and insistence that canada should become the 51st american state is fueling a remarkable rally-round-the-flag effect. canadian patriotism is skyrocketing alongside disdain for all things american throughout the great white north.new data suggests canadians desire to visit the u.s. is absolutely tanking.and some canadians are ditching their winter homes in the u.s. as tensions between the two countries simmer.josh coddington, a spokesperson for the arizona office of tourism, told axios the state hasnt seen any data yet on the economic effects in arizona.why it matters anything that discourages canadian tourism to arizona will negatively affect the states economy.canada is the second-largest source of international visitors to arizona, behind mexico.by the numbers in 2023, about 822,500 canadians visited arizona and spent about 775 million here, coddington said.and, he noted, that figure doesnt take in the full economic impact of snowbirds who stay longer than 30 days.when visitors stay for that long, they behave more like seasonal residents.driving the news advance bookings for canada-u.s. flights for april-september are down over 70 compared with this time last year, per aviation data firm oag.this sharp drop suggests that travelers are holding off on making reservations, likely due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding the broader trade dispute, writes oag chief analyst john grant.airlines are also reducing transborder capacity a strong signal that they, too, are seeing or at least predicting less demand.yes, but at least one airline is calling oags data into question.the numbers are not reflective of air canadas booking patterns, nor the state of the market, based on all information sources available to us, an air canada spokesperson told travel news site the points guy tpg.reality check the spokesperson confirmed theres been a softening in demand and the airline has trimmed capacity accordingly.threat level a mere 10 drop in canadian visitors could cost u.s. businesses as much as 2.1 billion in revenue, tpg notes.delta air lines, united airlines and american airlines are all down around 30 to 40 so far this year.several major airlines, including delta and american, previously warned of soft first quarters amid weakening consumer demand.meanwhile, trumps tariffs and taunts may be the last straw for snowbirds who are already finding it more expensive to live south of the border, real estate agents say.americas northern neighbors make up 11 of foreign homebuyers on average over the past decade, according to national association of realtors data shared with axios.florida attracts the most canadian buyers, followed by arizona and california.between the lines snowbirds are also rattled by the trump administrations move to require canadians staying in the u.s. for longer than 30 days to register with immigration authorities, says alexandra dupont, a broker with dual citizenship who helps snowbirds buy and sell condos in florida.mike huckins, a spokesperson for the greater phoenix chamber of commerce, told ktar last month that although the rule only applies to canadians who plan to stay for more than 30 days, youre already seeing some of those short-term visitors pull back on their travel plans.what theyre saying we are done for a while, martin buck, a canadian who sold his familys arizona vacation home just before trump was sworn in, told the vancouver sun.support local journalism by becoming a member.learn moremore phoenix stories

  Content: by michael every of rabobank the bank of canada left rates on hold at 2.75, as expected and predicted either we get a quick resolution to us-canada trade tensions or a year-long recession see here for more. theres the kind of nasty, geopolitical, binary outcome i was flagging for 2025 from mid-2024. fed chair powell said tariffs may raise inflation and unemployment, so no rate cuts for you. its nice to see the guys who earn, and manage, the big bucks are on the ball. next up today, the ecb please see our preview here many forks in the road. we expect them to cut the deposit rate by 25bp to 2.25, an additional cut to the one we see in june, so we now have our terminal rate at 2. however, this is again all very much contingent on trade developments, and a significant further escalation of the trade war could require the ecb to return to an accommodative policy stance, even as the fed seems to be leaning the other way. on trade, president trump said big progress is being made on a deal with japan, and the white house also expects one with the uk in three weeks. europe can get one too if it decouples from china but germaneu firms are lobbying to give china a second chance -and why wouldnt europe try again with the economy wiping out its auto industry and propping up the russian war-economy which the eu is rearming against?- as some worry the eu will sleepwalk into the china bloc due to its own rigidities. that outcome could risk making the us outright adversarial in energy, defence, and swaplines as well as trade but even that doesnt necessarily mean institutional inertiamotion, or because markets mindsets, can adapt in time. its unclear what the ecb would do in those worst-case scenarios, and presumably they wont even be alluded to today. expect them to remain cryptic. aware of this, however, is italian pm meloni, in the us today, with the eu worried she might strike a side deal for zero-tariffs on italian goods that would split the eu and open the door for others to follow suite. if you were the us and didnt like the eu, wouldnt you do exactly that? the question may be if the italians are prepared to reap the rewards for being the first to break rank while risking brickbats from the eu, and the downside if the us reneges on any agreement. chi non risica non rosica? elsewhere, oil markets noticed earlier arab press reports about a troop build-up vs the houthis now its in english on bloomberg and the latter also ran an op-ed about the five signs to look for ahead of a us-china war not trade war and we are already seeing all of them. that isnt very reassuring, or much guidance for markets. gold just surged to a new nominal high and is starting to move like a stock. glibly, this is risk off. yet even with the middle east and china news above that misses whats also happening as the us tries to remake itself by remaking the global trading and financial system. this missive from matthew pines shows how us gold reserves could be revalued vastly higher to create 1 trillion of fiscal breathing room and to bid up bitcoin. alongside tectonic shifts in the global architecture, is gold up only as a haven rather than front-running? likewise, usd-backed stablecoins, where framing legislation is moving forwards, may also see up to 1-1.5 trillion of new demand for us t-bills ahead. thats also a controversial and potentially market-moving hypothesis that goes beyond just saying crypto . ok, so heres my latest take on how bessent may be able to revalue the gold certificates wo legislation under 31 usc 5117 the gold reserve act of 1934, the u.s. treasury is authorized to issue gold certificates to the federal reserve banks, backed by the gold it holds, at httpst.covrrcs3pgui matthew pines matthew_pines april 16, 2025 however, looking ahead, the larger issue would be if such financial fartcraft were followed by the economic statecraft of adopting gold, bitcoin, or stablecoins -only accessible via the us dollar- as neutral reserve assets for external trade and clearing. that would truly start the global bifurcation some have been warning of as a risk for years and have massive market implications. indeed, what if either the us or china, or europe refuse to accept bitcoin, stablecoins, or gold even if the others dodoes? mercantilist china, with a vast trade surplus, has no issues with any neutral reserve asset. partially-mercantilist europe is pushing ahead with a digital euro cbdc would it want to switch to another usd asset if its in the china bloc, or to gold? the us, with a vast trade deficit, has a huge problem with a neutral reserve asset until it reindustrialises if it wants to avoid a larger inflation shock than that presented by tariffs i.e., all commodities follow gold higher. and it has already banned all central bank digital currencies within the us system, which will necessarily keep a digital euro off the balance sheet of any us entity. hypothetically, what if the us revalued gold higher -encouraging china to buy more of it, which it is doing, partly to prevent capital flight- then used the 1 trillion from that and the 1-1.5 trillion from stablecoin issuance to help onshore production. and then banned gold again, leaving china with a lot of shiny metal that wouldnt be useful to it as reserves, or within the uswestern bloc? why wouldnt it do so, in fact? because gold? recall the us has form, having seizedgone off gold in the 1930s, and going off it again in the 1970s. of course, this is probably too many dots for those who think only in dot plots, or gold yachts, to join. yet if we are going to see financial steps in that bifurcating direction, again we can look for warning signs like more digital ring-fencing of crypto assets to keep some in and some out. saying what assets can and cant be used where is not just regulation, as some will dully put it, any more than chinas common prosperity was it would literally be the digging of trenches to lay the pipes for future central bank liquidity within non-fungible systems. meanwhile, see here for our indicative quantitative scenario of what trade bifurcation and milder trade war outcomes could imply for the us, europe, and china dont focus on any one macro number - the point is to look at the spread between them. and, yes, the current american bull in a china shop may be able to force china to shop a lot more at a high economic price to everyone - but that would just be economic statecraft over policy again. and kudos to jeffrey powell and lize naute for their brilliantly original innovation of using an economic gravity model of trade that places china 1,000,000km from the us, three times the distance of the moon from the earth, to simulate a cold war-style bifurcation. its also hardly a quiet day on multiple other fronts. reportedly, the irs have begun stripping harvard university - which some have called a hedge-fund with a highly politicised school attached- of its tax-exempt status. a us judge has found probable cause to hold the trump administration in criminal contempt of court for defying his order to turn around planes in mid-air, as some legal experts point out he likely doesnt have jurisdiction on the issue at all, which will now have to be adjudicated by the supreme court again. lastly, the financial times says astronomers have found the strongest signs yet of alien life. i now await their editorial piece arguing that anyone coming from krypton must be in favour of ricardian free trade, because anything else would be illogical . then again, superman used to promote truth, justice, and the american way which today would mean high tariffs, bitcoin, and usd-backed stablecoins.

Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
