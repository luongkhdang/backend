  Title: Police seize enough fentanyl ‘to kill everyone in Portland twice,’ arrest 46 in multi-agency trafficking crackdown
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-22 23:31:33)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article highlights a state-level response (law enforcement agencies) to a perceived threat (fentanyl trafficking) originating from a non-state actor (Sinaloa Cartel) across international borders. This aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize security and power in an anarchic international system. The quote 'our partnership with local, state, and federal agencies makes our collective response stronger' exemplifies the state's attempt to consolidate power to address the threat.; Intriguing_angles: The article emphasizes the success of the operation and the collaboration between agencies, but it doesn't delve into the root causes of the drug crisis or the social factors contributing to drug use and trafficking. This omission could be a deliberate choice to focus on the immediate law enforcement response rather than addressing the more complex underlying issues. What are the long-term strategies to address the root causes of drug trafficking and addiction in Portland?

  Title: SURVEY: Half Americans Have Given Up On Saving Money...
  Source: studyfinds.org (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights the prevalence of financial insecurity among Americans, influencing public perception and potentially shaping policy priorities. The repeated emphasis on savings shortfalls and reliance on savings for emergencies, "67 of americans feel theyre lagging behind their savings targets. even worse, 47 have completely given up hope," frames the issue as a widespread problem. This can lead to increased public concern and demand for solutions.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Gen Z's relatively high satisfaction with their banks (71%) but also their willingness to switch (45%). This juxtaposition is intriguing because it suggests a potential disconnect between perceived satisfaction and actual loyalty. What specific factors, beyond those mentioned, might be driving Gen Z's willingness to switch banks despite their reported satisfaction? Could this indicate a deeper dissatisfaction with certain aspects of banking services that aren't fully captured by the satisfaction metric?

  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism is relevant here. The article illustrates how a shift in the U.S. administration's policies and rhetoric, specifically "steep trade tariffs" and "suggestions that canada should become a u.s. state," directly impacts Canada's economic and social well-being. This aligns with Realism's emphasis on states acting in their self-interest and the pursuit of power, leading to a competitive and sometimes conflictual international environment. The resulting "chill that has blanketed relations" and the economic consequences for both countries demonstrate the core tenets of Realist thought.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that some Canadians are "quietly preparing to let go of their second homes" but "holding back to see how things play out." This suggests a level of uncertainty and a potential for further shifts in behavior depending on future political developments. What specific political or economic indicators are these Canadians monitoring, and what threshold would trigger a more widespread exodus?; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the economic reliance of South Florida on Canadian snowbirds, stating they "either own property and pay property tax or rent for the winter months - either way, a boost to the economy." However, it doesn't quantify the overall economic impact or explore potential mitigation strategies. What percentage of South Florida's economy is directly attributable to Canadian snowbirds, and what alternative revenue streams are being considered to offset the potential loss?

  Content: by doyinsola oladipo and mrinalika roy reuters -the number of canadian snowbirds planning to sell their second homes in sunny florida and arizona has surged this spring, many of them put off by the sudden chill that has blanketed relations between their homeland and the u.s. real estate agents say they are seeing more canadians cashing out, further softening property prices in warm-weather states that have long attracted retirees and tourists from cold and snowy canada. canadians spent close to 6 billion on u.s. real estate from april 2023 to march 2024 - making up 13 of all foreign transactions - more than any other nationality, according to data from the national association of realtors. nearly half of the homes purchased by canadians were for vacation purposes, with florida, arizona and hawaii ranking as the top markets. last week, tracy and dale mcmullen sold their vacation home in buckeye, arizona, a property they owned for five years. the alberta residents, who usually spend four to five months in arizona a year, said they are not planning to come back. we decided to sell the property after the current potus took office, said dale, referring to u.s. president donald trump, who was inaugurated for the second time in january. it was time to leave. we felt we could not trust what he might do next to us as individuals and to our country. we no longer felt welcome nor safe. canadians are feeling stung by the actions and words of the trump administration, which has imposed steep trade tariffs on its northern neighbor, threatening canadas export-dependent economy. trumps repeated suggestions that canada should become a u.s. state, and his derogatory references to now-former prime minister justin trudeau as governor have annoyed canadians and offended their national pride. as a result, many canadians are boycotting u.s.-made goods, such as bourbon and produce and canceling trips to u.s. destinations. canadian return flights from the u.s. fell 13.5 in march from a year earlier, according to statistics canada. canadian-resident return trips by automobile fell about 32. real estate is now facing a similar pullback in demand. laurie lavine, a realtor in arizona who helped the mcmullens with their sale, told reuters that he currently has 18 listings from canadians looking to sell, compared with the usual two to four per quarter. trade friction and the current weakness of the canadian dollar are also contributing to the pullback, lavine said. canadians are also feeling picked on, with u.s. border agents enforcing stricter rules on entering the country, he added. beginning this month, the trump administration is requiring all foreigners 14 or older to register and submit fingerprints if they stay beyond 30 days. canadians, who previously could visit for up to six months without a visa, are subject to the new requirement. the sour feelings that many canadians suddenly feel toward the u.s. are having a big impact on the property market in florida, one of the closest warm-weather states to ontario and quebec, canadas most populous provinces. south floridas residential market has for decades been reliant on the annual influx of canadian snowbirds who either own property and pay property tax or rent for the winter months - either way, a boost to the economy, said ermengarde jabir, a director of economic research at moodys analytics. the first quarter is typically the peak buying season for condominiums in the region, coinciding with when many snowbirds are in town, said andrea hartmann, managing partner of the sandy hartmann group, a real estate firm in the tampa bay area. since the beginning of the year we have not received an offer from a canadian buyer even once, and normally we would, she said. floridas housing market is already reeling. prospective buyers have faced rising insurance premiums, concerns over climate change and a series of devastating hurricanes in recent years. in the tampa-st. petersburg-clearwater region, mortgage lock volume for second homes - or the number of buyers securing rates ahead of purchases - fell 25 on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2025, according to optimal blue, a mortgage technology and data company. now with the political issue, the cost of maintaining a place here in florida and the insurance, a lot of them decided to sell and go, said ken obrian, owner of southwest coast realty in naples, which has specialized in helping canadians purchase properties in florida for about 20 years. there is no incentive to come to the states anymore, said donny b., a native of ontario who is looking to sell his two investment properties in florida. like many snowbirds interviewed for this story, he declined to give his surname, saying he feared backlash. he said he decided to sell because of the political uncertainty, the exchange rate and concern about whether floridians would still welcome canadians in the current climate. i got down here on wednesday and i was nervous. im like, are people going to be pissed off at me? other states have started to see an exodus as well. agents in los angeles and palm springs, california, are working with canadian sellers who are quietly preparing to let go of their second homes, said fatima malik, global real estate advisor at engel volkers beverly hills. some are holding back to see how things play out, but others are already shifting their sights toward places like portugal, mexico, and parts of france, she added. reporting by doyinsola oladipo in new york and mrinalika roy in bengaluru editing by frank mcgurty and paul simao

  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article highlights how the collaboration between Takashi Murakami and the Dodgers, along with the MLB Tokyo Series, successfully captured public attention. The text states, "the overall success of the tokyo series collection delighted murakami" and "i was surprised by the overwhelming response." This suggests that the media coverage and marketing efforts surrounding the event effectively placed it on the public's agenda, leading to increased interest and demand.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions the merchandise hitting the secondary market for four times the purchase price. This suggests a potential imbalance between supply and demand, and raises the question: Was the limited availability of the merchandise intentional to drive up prices and create hype, and if so, what are the ethical implications of such a strategy?; Intriguing_angles: The article notes Murakami's surprise at the overwhelming response in Japan, stating, "honestly, i had thought baseball wasnt as major a sport in japan these days."

  Title: Team Trump defends tariffs as bipartisan opposition grows, markets slide
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-06 18:36:37)
  Content: trump administration officials blitzed television networks sunday to defend the presidents massive tariffs that have caused a sell-off in the stock market and triggered recession fears, arguing that the import taxes are already forcing dozens of countries to come to the bargaining table. fifty countries were burning the phone lines into the white house to negotiate with president donald trump, agriculture secretary brooke rollins told cnns state of the union. dont panic, white house senior counselor peter navarro said on fox newss sunday morning futures. and treasury secretary scott bessent, speaking on nbcs meet the press, dismissed predictions from economists and banks that there would be a recession. the full-court press from cabinet members and advisers came as the administration is under immense pressure to pull back on the tariffs, which have caused the biggest loss in american stock market wealth since the panicked sell-off as covid-19 spread in march 2020. a growing number of conservatives are pushing back against trumps moves, with a nonprofit backed by right-wing megadonor charles koch leading a lawsuit against the tariffs, while some republicans in both chambers of congress are organizing a legislative effort to roll them back. and though administration officials remain in lockstep in their support of trump, some of the presidents most vocal supporters are beginning to question the moves. speaking via video call to a conference of italian right-wing politicians on saturday, billionaire trump funder elon musk said he hopes europe and the united states will eliminate all tariffs between them. hedge-fund investor bill ackman, a regular defender of trump, said on x on saturday that he thinks the president will delay the tariffs on monday as trump works through negotiations with countries that are willing to lower their own trade barriers. the risk of not doing so is that the massive increase in uncertainty drives the economy into a recession, potentially a severe one, ackman wrote. ben shapiro, the right-wing pundit and co-founder of the daily wire, called the tariffs probably unconstitutional and illogical, and the wall street journals editorial board, as well as guests on fox news, have criticized the tariffs. meanwhile, liberal politicians are lambasting the president, as did tens of thousands of protesters who took to the streets of washington and cities around the country on saturday in what appeared to be the biggest demonstrations against trump since he took office in january. trump hanging tough still, trump is holding the course. on saturday, he implored followers on his social media platform truth social to hang tough. this is an economic revolution, and we will win, he said. trump administration officials offered two main justifications for the tariffs, saying they are meant to accomplish the long-term goal of completely reforming the american economy while giving the u.s. increased negotiating power to strike new trade deals. this is the ultimate dealmaker who is a businessman at the head of our government, rollins said. at the same time, the agriculture secretary framed the tariffs as part of a long-overdue new american order to protect u.s. industries. though she insisted the dip was a product of the markets adjusting, rollins acknowledged short-term uncertainty for american farmers, noting that the white house is ready to deploy financial aid to them if needed. some of the countries criticized by trump for putting tariffs on american imports, such as india, do so to keep prices stable for their own farmers. financial analysts from global banks, including barclays, bank of america, deutsche bank and the royal bank of canada, have all said the u.s. stands a higher chance of entering into a recession if the tariffs are not pulled back. j.p. morgan economists and analysts see a 60 percent chance of a recession happening this year. but bessent said sunday that the economy remains strong. there doesnt have to be a recession, bessent said, calling the 6 trillion stock-market drop a short-term reaction and comparing the current moment to the early days of ronald reagans presidency. he also rejected warnings from economists and skeptical fellow republicans, arguing that the tariffs are a one-time price adjustment and not a source of lasting inflation. bessent declined to say whether the tariffs are permanent but said they have given trump maximum leverage to renegotiate trade terms. the market consistently underestimates donald trump, he added. were going to hold the course. navarro, for his part, told americans to hold on to their stock portfolios despite cratering share prices. right now the smart strategy is not to panic, just stay in, because we are going to have the biggest boom in the stock market we have ever seen under the trump policies, he said sunday. we will find a bottom in this market quickly. we will hit 50,000 on the dow easily by the end of this term. the dow jones industrial average, a basket of stocks representing 30 big, well-known companies, hit an all-time high of just over 45,000 in december. it was at around 38,000 when the market closed friday which came on the heels of the worst quarter for stocks since spring 2022. meanwhile, gop opposition to the tariffs is growing. rep. don bacon r-nebraska said sunday on cbss face the nation that on monday he will unveil some of the support for his house bill, a companion to a senate bill that aims to bring back control of tariffs to congress. the move is notable because the house has already passed a procedural vote to prevent the chamber from voting on any proposed bill ending trumps emergency declaration on tariffs against mexico, canada and china. it will be harder to pass this in the house, no doubt, bacon conceded. i think if we get 60 votes in the senate itll put pressure on the house to look at this, and if we continue to see the stock market go in a certain direction or if we see inflation or unemployment shift in a bad way, i think this bill becomes very viable. people voted for trump because of inflation, immigration and crime, he noted, adding, i dont think tariffs was really a big factor in peoples decision-making in electing him last november. while trumps cabinet members claimed that dozens of countries are trying to reach the president to negotiate, democrats seized on the fact that trump had spent some of the weekend playing golf. that may end up being the most enduring image of the trump presidency, sen. adam schiff d-california said on nbcs meet the press. the president out on a golf cart while peoples retirement is in flames. while theres growing bipartisan support in congress to rein in trumps tariff authority, the moment demands immediate action, schiff added.

  Title: Full Episode: Trump announces tariff policy, DeSantis takes on Fine over CD-6 results - Spectrum News 13
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-03 00:30:00)
  Content: president donald trump announces his latest tariff policy, and lawmakers in the florida house advance a proposal to reduce sales taxes in the state. president donald trump ordered the implementation of reciprocal tariffs on nations around the globe wednesday, bucking concerns from members of his own party and volatile markets to levy import taxes on billions of dollars of products that could raise consumer costs for american households by thousands of dollars a year, at least in the short term. trump said at event at the white houses rose garden that the move, which will transform u.s. trade relations with trade partners around the globe, comes on one of the most important days, in my opinion, in american history and is in response to years of the u.s. being looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations, in the presidents words. its our declaration of economic independence. for years, hardworking american citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense, trump said at the event after walking out to a backdrop of numerous american flags. but now its our turn to prosper and in so doing use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and itll all happen very quickly. during his remarks, trump held up a chart showing the reciprocal tariffs would be roughly half of the rate of tariffs he claims other countries levy on u.s. products, including 34 tariffs on imports from china and 20 tariffs on imports from the european union. but the white house has offered few details, and it was unclear where the data on the chart came from. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. the president has promised that factory jobs will return to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk causing a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on cars, clothes and other goods. the new tariffs, on a day trump dubbed liberation day, follow similar recent announcements of 25 taxes on auto imports levies against china, canada and mexico and expanded trade penalties on steel and aluminum. trump has also imposed tariffs on countries that import oil from venezuela and he plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. trump invited brian pannebecker, a retired autoworker who spoke at the republican national convention to speak briefly at his white house news conference on tariffs. my entire life i have watched plant after plant after plant close, pannebecker said. pannebecker, a michigan resident, is the founder of auto workers for trump. the influential union united auto workers endorsed democrat kamala harris in the 2024 election but has backed trumps plans to boost tariffs on imported vehicles. the florida house on wednesday took its first steps toward permanently reducing the states sales tax. the house ways and means committee advanced the bill unanimously, but it still has a long way to go. the florida house still needs to persuade the senate and gov. ron desantis that this is the right path forward. though at the moment, neither is looking too thrilled about the plan. under the bill, floridas 6 sales tax would lower permanently to 5.25. the house estimates that floridians under the bill could save around 5 billion every year. floridas sales tax has sat at 6 since 1988. the bill would also reduce sales tax on a variety of other things like commercial sales tax, electricity, and mobile homes. we are clearly setting a course, and a vision is going to provide immediate, meaningful relief to every single floridian that makes a purchase, state rep. wyman duggan said. i candidly have some concerns with the education budget as it pertains to my school district, but i feel confident will work that out in the budget silo and delivering relief to everyday floridians in a quick and effective way should be our commitment, state rep. anna eskamani said. the house, senate, and the governor all want some sort of tax relief passed this legislative session. the house wants to cut the sales tax, but desantis wants property tax. and the senate stated it is somewhere in between, though some are concerned about any permanent cuts and the potential for a subsequent budget shortfall. gov. ron desantis reacted to the special election results wednesday. specifically, the race in u.s. house district 6. the governor reiterated that he had predicted rep. randy fine would underperform president donald trumps metrics in that district and blamed the candidate himself. i think you have a candidate in randy fine who one, hes a squish, desantis said. he supported restrictions on second amendment rights back in 2018. he tried to defeat my immigration proposal to help president trump enforce immigration laws. and he tried to enact a de facto, make florida a de facto sanctuary state. and so when people see that, our base voters dont get excited about that, youre not giving them a reason to go out and vote. the governor also rejected the idea that the 15-point swing in the district since november was a referendum on trumps agenda. fine fired back at the governor wednesday, writing on social media, a dying star burns hottest before it fades into oblivion. im focused on working with realdonaldtrump to stop democrats from taking this country backwards, not working with them. lets go.

  Title: How to trade the Magnificent 7 amid the market sell-off - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 12:00:21)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The market reaction described, where "stocks rally on new hopes for trade progress" and "stocks climbed as the us hailed progress... and the treasury secretary hinted at deescaltion", aligns with the **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**, particularly the semi-strong form. This theory posits that asset prices reflect all publicly available information. The immediate positive market movement following public statements about trade talks suggests that this new information was rapidly incorporated into stock prices, illustrating how markets theoretically process and react to geopolitical and economic news as it becomes available.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article's structure, presenting numerous headlines focused on specific market indices, trade developments, and individual company performance (Tesla, Intel, Nike, etc.), can be viewed through the lens of **Agenda-Setting Theory**. By giving prominence and repeated mention to these particular topics, the news outlets (Yahoo Finance, Reuters, Bloomberg, etc.) are highlighting certain aspects of the financial world, potentially influencing which issues readers perceive as most important or relevant at this time, thereby shaping the public's financial agenda.; Intriguing_angles: The text simultaneously reports "hints of key progress on china" and de-escalation expectations from the Treasury Secretary and Bessent, while also mentioning specific, significant tariffs like "3,500 tariffs on panel exporters" and "RTXs 850m tariff hit, 3,521 solar tariff". This juxtaposition is intriguing because it presents a narrative of easing tensions alongside concrete evidence of ongoing or new protectionist measures. Could this framing emphasize positive diplomatic signals while downplaying the persistent economic friction caused by tariffs? Does the article's structure imply that the market is reacting more strongly to the *hope* of de-escalation than to the reality of existing tariffs?

  Title: Tariffs are another reason why Americans feel so lousy about the economy - NPR
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-03 09:00:00)
  Content: americans are worried about the economy as president trump unveils a new round of tariffs. some people are dialing back on spending as a result. spencer plattgetty imagesgetty images north america hide caption americans are in a funk about the economy and its beginning to take a toll on their spending. as president trump rolls out a new round of tariffs, shoppers are keeping a tight grip on their wallets, setting the stage for a possible economic slowdown. personal spending was weaker than expected in february, according to the commerce department, with lower spending on discretionary services such as restaurant meals. and people across the political spectrum say theyre worried about their personal finances, unemployment and inflation, suggesting the presidents policies on tariffs and government job cuts are partly to blame. a survey by the university of michigan found consumer sentiment fell in march for the third month in a row. i dont see things moving in a positive direction. i really dont, says dan fitch, a nurse who works for the veterans administration in portland, ore. the cost of living has already been elevated for a while. so adding on tariffs i dont see how that positively affects anybody. fitch says he and his family arent traveling as much as they usually do. and hes even stopped paying for haircuts for his 3-year and 7-year-old sons. i bought a pair of clippers and im cutting both my kids hair now. heck, i might start doing my own, too, fitch says. it can get pretty ugly but its worth it for a little more peace of mind where your money is concerned. a billboard in miramar, fla., displays a message reading tariffs are a tax on your grocery bill on march 28, 2025. the canadian government has placed the anti-tariff billboards in numerous american cities. joe raedlegetty imagesgetty images north america hide caption a new cbs news poll finds a majority of americans think the president is focusing too much attention on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices. although inflation has fallen substantially since peaking in 2022, consumer prices are still high and are likely to climb even higher as tariffs take effect. i try to stick to a budget and its been very hard to stick to a budget, says kathy merkler, a research laboratory coordinator in tampa, fla. im paying the same amount of money for fewer bags of groceries. merkler is also concerned about the scientific job market, given the federal cutbacks at the national institutes of health and the centers for disease control and prevention. she and her husband have debated whether its a good time to replace their aging car, a 2015 kia soul. even though its on its second engine and its got at least 225,000 miles on it, its still a good car, merkler says. the 25 tariff trump has ordered on imported cars and car parts is expected to add thousands of dollars to the price of a new car while driving up used car prices as well. consumer spending is the biggest driver of the u.s. economy, and it remained remarkably resilient through the pandemic and the period of high inflation that followed. but now that consumer engine may be sputtering a bit. i think if youre a consumer, youre sitting there and saying, ugh, im not so sure about these tariffs here, says dan north, a senior economist at allianz trade north america. my income is kind of dwindling a little bit. oh, and by the way, i just opened up my credit card bill and theres still items i need to pay off from christmas. im gonna draw my horns in a little bit. the recent gyrations in the stock market also may have rattled peoples nerves, leaving them less eager to spend. the sp 500 index has fallen more than 5 since trump took office in january. the threat of tariffs hasnt been all bad for spending. some shoppers raced to buy big-ticket items in february, before most of the import taxes took effect. spending on durable goods jumped 1.4 during the month. but forecasters say that burst of spending is not likely to last. michigan librarian dawn woodward is cutting back on spending. but she did buy a new television weeks early for her sons birthday, in order to avoid a threatened tariff. courtesy of dawn woodward hide caption dawn woodward, a librarian in michigan, bought her son a new television weeks before his birthday, in an effort to avoid an expected tariff. when it comes to other shopping, though, woodward is trying to cut back. i found that stuff that i thought that i needed oh my gosh, i need this or i need that i didnt actually need most of it, she says. instead of buying stuff, woodward is putting more money aside in a her familys emergency fund. and shes not alone. the share of income that people sock away in savings rose to 4.6 last month its highest level in eight months. its another sign of how wary americans are feeling as president trump doubles down on tariffs.

points to 3.95. but the rally faded somewhat after a solid us jobs and comments from fed chair jerome powell suggested that the central bank is focused on the impact of tariffs on inflation dashed expectations for immediate rate cuts. still, money markets have priced in nearly four quarter-point rate reductions this year, up from just three cuts before the levies were announced wednesday. listen to the heres why podcast on apple, spotify or anywhere you listen everything today is being driven by the expectation that the economy is going to take a major hit, said jan nevruzi, an interest-rate strategist at td securities. earlier in the session, china announced it would impose a 34 tariff on all imports from the us, raising the specter of a global trade war. later, powell said the economic impact of new tariffs is likely to be significantly larger than expected. it was the central bank chiefs first public appearance since march 19, when policymakers opted to hold rates steady, as expected. then, the fed lowered median projections for gdp and lifted those for inflation. still, powell said after the meeting that policymakers base case was that a tariff-induced inflation bump would be transitory. on friday, trump urged the fed to cut interest rates, one day after he said he welcomed the slide in 10-year yields. treasury secretary scott bessent has said repeatedly that lower treasury yields are a priority for the administration. trump will tell them to feel the market and eventually they will cut not in may, though, said neil dutta, head of us economic research at renaissance macro research. powell is focused on inflation expectations even as financial conditions have tightened. thats hawkish, all else equal. the ongoing reaction across markets has been stark. the sp 500 saw its worst two-day plunge since march 2020 in a rout that has shed about 5 trillion in value, with the gauge down 6 on friday. the nasdaq 100 entered a bear market. markets have priced in a roughly 50 probability of a quarter-point rate reduction at the next fed meeting in may. some traders are even betting on an emergency rate cut before the may 6-7 meeting, with open interest in the april fed funds futures soaring. many of the moves persisted even after march employment data released friday showed that 228,000 nonfarm jobs were created, exceeding the 140,000 median forecast of economists in a bloomberg survey. january and february job gains were revised lower, though, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2. what bloomberg strategists say. a lot of this bond market rally will have to be reversed in the next couple of months. and with no relief from discount rates implied by treasury yields, equities will suffer even more as a consequence. this is stagflation with inflation as the binding constraint. edward harrison, the everything risk newsletter, washington the bond market is seeming to keep its focus on the tariff news, said zachary griffiths, head of investment-grade and macroeconomic strategy at creditsights. european bonds have been swept up in the bond rally, anticipating a hit to growth from the 20 us tariff. germanys 10-year yield, the regional benchmark, has plunged this week, erasing the surge unleashed by the nations increased spending plans in march. traders also expect the european central bank to lower rates more sharply, with three quarter-point reductions fully priced in for this year and a chance of a fourth. the bank of england also is seen easing 74 basis points. the global bond surge even saw sub-zero rates return in some corners. the bid yield on two-year swiss government bonds turned negative for the first time since 2022. the swiss national bank cut its key policy rate to 0.25 from 1.75 last year, and traders are betting on at least another quarter-point cut by the end of 2025, with some hedging for further easing. bloomberg economics estimates us tariffs could reduce us demand for swiss goods goods by around 60. for mark dowding, chief investment officer at rbc bluebay asset management, the repricing has already gone far enough. he doubts that both the fed and ecb will be able to respond to tariffs with monetary easing, citing inflationary concerns in the us and an emphasis on fiscal support in europe, and is instead looking for entry points to bet against bonds once markets settle. the rally in bond yields appears overdone, he wrote in a note. we think the fed will do nothing for the foreseeable future, as long as there is not a large rise in unemployment. treasuries have already rallied 3.8 this year, according to a bloomberg gauge of us debt. in the us, fed officials have said that a resilient labor market and sticky inflation mean they can afford to stand pat, even as trumps tariffs sapped consumer and business confidence. this jobs report is going to create an absolute mess for the fed response to economic risks, said guy lebas, chief fixed income strategist for janney montgomery scott. the best case for risk assets is that the data deteriorate quickly enough to generate a fed response. the bad case for risk assets is that jobs muddle through in the face of warmer short-term inflation prints. economists generally expect that tariffs will lift inflation and slow growth, keeping the fed in wait-and-see mode. but the tariffs unveiled wednesday were larger than anticipated, clouding the picture. while morgan stanley now expects no cuts this year, down from one previously, citing inflation risks, ubs global wealth management see more easing this year. vineer bhansali, chief investment officer and founder of longtail alpha, said hes buying two-year notes and selling 30-year bonds, a trade known as a curve

  Title: Trump announces huge new tariffs to promote US manufacturing, risking inflation and trade wars
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 20:57:51)
  Content: by josh boak associated press washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the new tariffs, coming on what trump has named liberation day, are a bid to boost u.s. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he says are years of unfair trade practices. but by most economists assessments, the move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and upend decades-old alliances. the white house is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble. april 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern american history, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said tuesday. she said the new tariffs would take effect immediately. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. based on the possibility of broad 20 tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. because trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. leavitt is among three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the associated press on first and fifth amendment grounds. the ap says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. the white house says the ap is not following an executive order to refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america.

  Content: maybe all that winning was becoming boring. whatever the reasons that led president trump to rock the globe with his liberation day tariff regime, the immediate result has been a world of hurt for millions upon millions of americans. the stock market meltdown that wiped out some 6.4 trillion of value last thursday and friday means many households saw 10 or more of their nest eggs suddenly erased. their pain is matched only by their confusion about why the president triggered the sell-off. after all, trump 2.0 was scoring major successes by sealing the border and deporting alien criminals. the doge audit was proving his claims of massive government waste and fraud. similarly, his crackdown on columbia and other universities that allow hamas supporters to harass and intimidate jewish students is rattling the radicals where it hurts most in their multimillion dollar federal grants. meanwhile, his election provided a big boost to the economy, which has been humming along. because he has been faithful to his campaign promises, polls show trump with the highest approval rating hes ever had. his winning streak is not the only thing in jeopardy. given the tumult on wall street and in markets around the world, its reasonable to conclude that trump is betting his presidency and gop control of congress on the tariff gambit. that probably wasnt his plan, but like it not, thats how its playing out. the early returns are not promising. by 15 percentage points, voters hold a negative view of trumps handling of inflation and most oppose his emphasis on tariffs, a wall street journal poll finds. negative views of his economic stewardship outweigh positive views by 8 points, according to the survey, which was completed before markets tanked last week. public doubts about the economy are dramatic when you recall how important the subject was to trumps victory. his attacks on bidenomics and inflation became a key reason why trump swept the seven swing states and his party carried congress. yet demoralized and divided democrats now smell blood as some voters begin to sour. the disruption caused by the tariff war is so severe that jpmorgan economists predict it could take a big bite out of americas gross domestic product this year and warn that if, the tariffs remain in place, there is a 60 chance of a global recession. federal reserve chairman jerome powell, no fan of trumps to start with, said the tariffs could lead to both higher inflation and slower growth. naturally, the fear gauges are also rising among congressional republicans. texas sen. ted cruz said friday that if the tariff war pushes the us into a recession, particularly a bad recession, 2026 in all likelihood politically would be a bloodbath. you would face a democrat house, and you might even face a democrat senate. none of this is certain, of course, nor is it meant to suggest trumps goal isnt worthy. leveling global trade is admirable and a core tenet of his america first approach. he aims to protect and expand domestic manufacturing and create good, well-paying jobs by giving more companies incentives to move their headquarters and factories to the united states. its been a consistent theme since he entered politics in 2015 with a rousing denunciation of the globalists whose unfair trade practices hollowed out large industries in middle america. and he celebrated his 2024 win by hosting business titans at mar-a-lago who promised to invest in america. among them was japans softbank, whose chief executive pledged to invest 100 billion. thats the point of tariffs to incentivize companies to make their products and create jobs in the us. meanwhile, the taxes on imported products also provide washington with a source of revenue, with the white house predicting as much as 700 billion would be collected this year under the new rates, which would help fund tax cuts. if they are reciprocal, which trump insists he wants, tariffs would even the score by punishing imported goods at the same rate as countries do that impose high taxes on american products sold abroad. a prime example of the current imbalance was noted by white house adviser stephen miller why is that if you go to tokyo, theres no american cars, if you go to berlin, theres no american cars, but on our streets, we have every foreign car there is? he added theyve blocked their markets from our cars. president trump is saying that has to end. although the president has repeatedly denied it, the suspicion that the aim is to get trading partners to negotiate was effectively confirmed by trump himself friday afternoon. just had a very productive call with to lam, general secretary of the communist party of vietnam, who told me that vietnam wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s., he posted on truth social. but the first inkling of good news came just hours after china raised its tax on american products to 34, saying reciprocal levies were necessary to stop trumps bullying. subscribe to our daily post opinion newsletter! please provide a valid email address. by clicking above you agree to the terms of use and . china, of course, has long been the poster child of trade imbalances. a study from the us international trade commission reports that the sheer volume of chinas exports to the us outpaced americas exports to china by three to one in 2024. even a sneering axios concedes the facts, writing that china has a long record of trade abuses ip theft, forced technology transfers, state subsidies and market access restrictions for foreign companies. it continues the european union doesnt cheat the way china does. but it protects its own through generous agricultural subsidies and strict regulatory standards that often double as trade barriers. the vat, europes value added tax that can go as high as 27 in some countries, is another barrier on us imports. thus, with restrictive trade practices by other nations, theres often not much difference between friend and foe. leaving aside the predictable legacy media reaction to the turmoil one suspects there was glee in the new york times newsroom over the markets plunge and trumps political predicament there are also conservative skeptics. most of their doubts center on two elements the enormous size of the tariffs and the decision to unleash them all at once. some suggested that more modest rates and an industry-by-industry approach could be more effective because it would focus on specific countries and products, such as steel and aluminum. what do you think? post a comment. another argument is that onshoring cannot happen overnight. for foreign manufacturers to make a decision to relocate means building a facility in the us, hiring workers and producing goods a process that could take many months if not years. trump doesnt have years. the midterm elections are 19 months away. share your stance. please adhere to our the new pm of canada nailed it, he called for zero tariffs between canada and the us so both can become economic powers. this is part of the plan, drive new negotiations that favor the us economy and consumer. but the media wont ever admit that because of tds. im curious to what the next great t. a week of stock market activity doesnt mean that much, really. trump is trying to fix something that has been broken for years, and any change brings anxiety to people. will it work? we will have to wait and see, and the good news about tariffs is that they can be removed or lowered just as quickl. over the past couple of days i have seen videos of obama, pelosi and schumer talking about the unfair us trade tariff balance, especially with china. not one of them did anything to correct it though as it would hurt them politically. i give trump credit for at least trying to level the field. i do. i agree yes we need to fix the tarriff balance but a little at a time so as to preserve the lives of us citizens especially the elderly

  Title: ANGER BUILDS...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-06 19:25:36)
  Content: by jonathan landay and tim reid reuters -some 1,200 demonstrations are planned across the u.s. on saturday in what organizers expect to be the largest single day of protest against president donald trump and his billionaire ally elon musk since they launched a rapid-fire effort to overhaul government and expand presidential authority. thousands were streaming into downtown washington as the protests got underway under gloomy skies and light rain. organizers told reuters that more than 20,000 people were expected to attend the rally at the national mall. the protests in the u.s. will give trump opponents an opportunity to demonstrate their displeasure en masse in response to trumps raft of executive orders. some 150 activist groups have signed up to participate, according to the events website. protests are planned in all 50 states plus canada and mexico. protesters were lining the busy thoroughfare of connecticut avenue in washington, d.c., awaiting buses to take them downtown. they were carrying signs with slogans such as no kings in the usa and deport musk. terry klein, a retired biomedical scientist from princeton, new jersey, was among hundreds who gathered early in front of the stage below the washington monument. she said she drove down to attend the rally to protest trumps policies on everything from immigration to the doge stuff to the tariffs this week, to education. i mean, our whole country is under attack, all of our institutions, all the things that make america what it is. david madden, a 75-year old army veteran and retired trial lawyer, said he flew from dayton, ohio, to demonstrate against the injustice that is dominating this country, the institutions that are being stolen from the american people, the confusion in the courts, the fact that we have a population that i believe is essentially racist. with trumps blessing, musks department of government efficiency team has scythed through the u.s. government, eliminating more than 200,000 jobs from the 2.3 million federal workforce. at times, the effort has been haphazard and forced the recall of needed specialists. on friday, the internal revenue service began laying off more than 20,000 workers, as much as 25 of its ranks. several hundred people gathered on saturday outside the headquarters of the social security administration, a top doge target, near baltimore to protest against cuts to the agency which delivers benefits to the elderly and disabled. the mood was angry and defiant, after the agency recently announced cuts of 7,000 staff and the ending of phone services to millions of claimants. members of doge have been inside the building for weeks. many in the crowd of mostly retirees held handmade signs, including where has my country gone?, fire doge!, send musk to mars, and hands off social security!. linda falcao, who turns 65 in two months, told the crowd she had been paying into the social security fund since the age of 16. im terrified, im angry, im pissed, im bewildered this could happen to the united states, she said. i do love america and im heartbroken. i need my money. i want my money. i want my benefits! in response, the crowd chanted, its our money! white house assistant press secretary liz huston disputed the protesters charge that trump aimed to cut social security and medicaid. president trumps position is clear he will always protect social security, medicare, and medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. meanwhile, the democrats stance is giving social security, medicaid, and medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush american seniors, huston said in an email. much of trumps agenda has been restrained by lawsuits contending he has overstepped his authority with attempts to fire civil servants, deport immigrants and reverse transgender rights. trump returned to office on january 20 with a stream of executive orders and other measures critics say are aligned with an agenda outlined by project 2025, a deeply conservative political initiative to reshape government and consolidate presidential authority. his supporters have applauded trumps audacity as necessary to disrupt entrenched liberal interests. hours before the protests were due to kick off in the united states, hundreds of anti-trump americans living in europe gathered in berlin, frankfurt, paris and london to voice opposition to trumps sweeping makeover of u.s. foreign and domestic policies. about 200 people, mostly american, gathered on paris place de la republique, listening to speeches and waving banners ranging from resist tyrant, rule of law to feminists for freedom not fascism and save democracy. we have to show solidarity with all the demonstrations in a thousand cities today in the usa, democrats abroad spokesperson timothy kautz said in frankfurt. protester jose sanchez said trump was a con man who was destroying u.s. democracy. reporting by jonathan landay and tim reid in washington. additional reporting by daniel trotta in carlsbad, california, john irish in paris, emma-victoria farr, christian mang and frank simon in berlin and frankfurt sarah young in london. writing by james oliphant editing by frank mcgurty, toby chopra and alistair bell

  Title: Stocks, Dollar Sink on Threats to Fed Independence: Markets Wrap - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-21 14:22:55)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism. The article highlights a power struggle between President Trump and the Federal Reserve, specifically targeting Jerome Powell.  Evidence: "president donald trump stepped up criticism of jerome powell", "trump is studying whether hes able to fire powell", "rebuking the fed risks politicizing us monetary policy".  Interpretation: This aligns with Realist theory, where states (or in this case, branches of government and powerful individuals) are seen as primary actors vying for power and influence. Trump's actions demonstrate an attempt to exert political control over monetary policy, traditionally considered independent, to achieve desired economic outcomes and potentially consolidate power. This could signal a shift towards prioritizing political expediency over institutional norms.; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory. The news article prominently features President Trump's criticisms of the Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell, framing their actions as detrimental to the economy. Evidence: "president donald trump stepped up criticism of jerome powell on social media", "insisting there was virtually no inflation and it was time for preemptive cuts", "trump is studying whether hes able to fire powell". Interpretation: By repeatedly and publicly attacking the Fed, Trump is attempting to set the agenda, influencing public perception and potentially market expectations regarding monetary policy. This relentless criticism, amplified by news media, can shape the narrative around the Fed's performance and pressure them to adopt policies favored by the administration, regardless of the central bank's independent assessment of economic conditions. This illustrates how political actors can leverage media to influence policy discourse and potentially outcomes.; Intriguing_angles: Omission of Counterarguments. The article heavily emphasizes concerns about the Fed's independence being threatened by President Trump's actions and the potential negative market reactions. Textual Basis: The article quotes analysts predicting 'huge injection of volatility' and 'most dramatic rush to the exit from US assets' if Powell is fired. Significance: While presenting a clear narrative of risk, the article notably lacks substantial counterarguments or alternative perspectives. For instance, it does not explore potential benefits of lower interest rates advocated by Trump, nor does it delve into arguments for greater political accountability of the Fed. Probing Questions: Could this selective presentation of viewpoints contribute to a biased understanding of the situation? What are the potential implications of not fully exploring the rationale behind the political pressure on the Federal Reserve?; Intriguing_angles: Implicit Assumption of US Hegemony. The article discusses 'de-dollarisation' and 'move away from US hegemony' as realistic fears arising from the Fed's potential politicization. Textual Basis: 'not only is the independence of the fed clearly under threat, but the prospect of de-dollarisation and a move away from us hegemony is an increasingly realistic one.' Significance: This statement implicitly assumes the existing global order is centered around US dollar dominance and US hegemony, and that actions threatening the Fed's independence could undermine this order. It treats this hegemony as a given, rather than a potentially contested or evolving aspect of international relations. Probing Questions: Is the assumption of unchallenged US hegemony warranted in the current geopolitical landscape? Could the article's framing inadvertently reinforce a US-centric worldview by presenting de-dollarisation as inherently negative without exploring alternative perspectives on a multipolar financial system?

  Title: Republican backlash to Trump tariffs grows as Senate rebels decry ‘bad policy’
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-03 17:29:12)
  Content: the first signs of an internal us political backlash against donald trumps declaration of a global trade war are starting to emerge amid tanking stock markets worldwide, including on wall street, and widespread international criticism of the move. hours after trump unveiled a sweeping panoply of tariffs in an event he dubbed liberation day, four republican senators openly defied him by voting for a senate resolution from democrats demanding that the 25 tariffs on canadian products be reversed. the resolution lacks the force of law but its support from mitch mcconnell and rand paul, both of kentucky, susan collins of maine, and lisa murkowski of alaska, immediately signaled the deep misgivings among some republicans over trumps tariff gambit, which has triggered a global sell-off. mcconnell, the former senate majority leader, issued a scathing denunciation after wednesday evenings vote, calling tariffs bad policy that would trigger economic hardship. trade wars with our partners hurt working people most, he said in a statement. tariffs drive up the cost of goods and services. they are a tax on everyday working americans. further criticism came from trumps former vice-president, mike pence, who called the tariffs the largest peacetime tax hike in us history. these tariffs are nearly 10 times the size of those imposed during the trump-pence administration, and will cost american families over 3,500 per year, he posted. the four republicans who voted with democrats did so despite a public appeal from trump not to support the resolution, tabled by tim kaine, a democratic senator for virginia who was hillary clintons running mate in the 2016 presidential election, which trump won. the resolution was aimed at curtailing the powers trump claimed under the international emergency economic powers act, which he has invoked to tackle the uss 1.2tn trade deficit and, in the case of canada, cited the influx of fentanyl through its border. mcconnell pulled no punches in his attack on trumps policy. preserving the long-term prosperity of american industry and workers requires working with our allies, not against them. with so much at stake globally, the last thing we need is to pick fights with the very friends with whom we should be working with to protect against chinas predatory and unfair trade practices, he said. he added at a time when americans are tightening their belts, we would do well to avoid policies that heap on the pain. we ought to strengthen our friendships abroad, and reinforce our allies as pillars of american prosperity and security. paul, his fellow kentuckian, said the tariffs were unconstitutional. our constitution was very specific that taxes tariffs are a tax taxes originate in the house, come to the senate and then go the president, he told reporters. they dont just go to the president and no one else. what kind of system would it be if all of our taxes and laws were passed by one person? he later told fox news trade is proportional to wealth. the last 70 years of international trade has been an exponential curve upwards, and the last 70 years of prosperity has been upwards also. we are richer because of trade with canada, and so is canada. collins, the senator for maine, said tariffs would damage lobstering, agriculture and the pulp and paper industries in her state, which borders canada. she also lambasted imposing tariffs on us allies. the fact is, the vast majority of fentanyl in america comes from the southern border rather than from canada, she said on the senate floor. one of my biggest concerns is we should be distinguishing between allies and our adversaries and not treating them the same way. murkowski, a senator from alaska, said tariffs would also hurt her state and urged trump to find a better way to mutually secure our borders and address fentanyl trafficking than by starting a trade war. while not all canadian trade practices are fair, im keenly aware of the negative impacts in store for alaskan families and businesses should tariffs drive up the costs of essential goods, she posted on x. in alaska we share more than 1,538 miles of border with canada. we are friends, neighbors, partners, and allies when it comes to our economies, our mutual defense, our cultures, and, yes, our trade. the outspoken republican criticism hinted at a wider unease in the party that is mostly being kept muted for fear of repercussions from trump. thom tillis, a republican senator for north carolina, warned about potential irreparable damage to his farming constituents before wednesdays announcement. anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right need to talk to my farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy, he told cnn. they dont have time. so weve got to be crisp on this implementation. john thune, the republican senate majority leader, tried to reconcile his concerns with loyalty to trump. ive got my issue. i represent a state that is very dependent upon exports, he told reporters. but i do appreciate the presidents focus on making sure were getting better deals, and giving business an incentive to do business here in the united states. such equivocation contrasted with unambiguous condemnation from democrats, some of whom openly lauded the republican anti-tariff rebels. this is what happens when people speak up, posted the new jersey senator, cory booker, citing images of news headlines about the four senators votes and obliquely referencing his record-breaking senate floor speech this week denouncing trumps policies. chuck schumer, the democratic leader in the senate, posted 54 tariffs on china, 10 tariffs on iran, 0 tariffs on russia alongside a puzzled emoji. brian schatz, a hawaii senator and the democrats chief whip, posted ive never seen a president ruin the economy on purpose. responding, chris murphy, the outspoken connecticut senator who has emerged as an articulate advocate of the need for a democratic anti-trump fightback, wrote this is the thing to understand. its all on purpose. creating chaos and crisis.

  Title: Stock market rallies after closed-door remarks by Treasury Secretary Bessent - Fortune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 20:15:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The recurring mentions of 'Trump tariffs' and 'Trump policy changes' alongside discussions of corporate hits (RTX), market reactions ('volatility spike', 'markets open sharply higher'), and geopolitical shifts ('softens on china', 'china de-escalation') align with aspects of Political Economy theory. This perspective suggests that political decisions and the actions of key political figures (like Trump) are not merely isolated events but have direct, measurable consequences on economic actors (companies like RTX, markets) and international economic relations (China trade). The text provides evidence of this linkage by explicitly connecting policy actions (tariffs, changes) to economic outcomes (hits, market shifts).; Theories_and_interpretations: The juxtaposition of headlines about market reactions to political statements ('investors are finally taking trump seriously', 'markets open sharply higher after trump softens') and the mention of 'agenda-setting' in the context of financial news (implied by the focus on specific topics like tariffs, Fed Chair, China) could be viewed through the lens of Agenda-Setting Theory. While typically applied to media influence on public perception, here it highlights how the *focus* of political figures (Trump's statements on China, Powell) can directly influence the *agenda* of financial markets and news coverage, demonstrating the power of political rhetoric to shape economic attention and action, as evidenced by the immediate market response described.; Intriguing_angles: The text mentions 'doges staffing cuts' as a cause for the IRS's 'nightmare' tax season and potential refund delays. The term 'doges' is unusual in this context and lacks clear identification as a standard entity type (Organization, Government Agency). Its significance lies in being presented as a direct causal factor for a major government agency's operational failure, yet its nature remains undefined within the article. What entity or concept does 'doges' represent in this context, and why is it presented as a singular, impactful cause without further clarification?

  Title: World braces for 'Liberation Day' as Trump set to reveal sweeping tariffs
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-02 10:00:13)
  Content: markets and foreign capitals have braced themselves for a broad set of tariffs from president trump on wednesday, anxious for details on a dramatic shift in u.s. trade policy that is expected to supercharge the costs of cars, houses and everyday goods for americans. it is unclear whether the trump administration plans to impose a universal, baseline rate for import taxes on trading partners, or to customize tariff policy to each foreign nation, imposing reciprocal rates on a case-by-case basis. it is also unclear whether there will be any exceptions. a white house official told the times that exact details of the plan are still being perfected. the lack of clarity has rattled markets in recent weeks, driving the worst first annual quarter in three years and erasing gains on the standard poors 500 index made since trumps election victory in november. the white house said trump would announce his plans at 1 p.m. pacific time on wednesday, precisely when closing bells ring on wall street. after that, the new policy will be effective immediately, white house press secretary karoline leavitt told reporters at a tuesday news briefing. costs could rise immediately on perishable goods caught in limbo at international ports, including avocados and pineapples, said sung won sohn, a former commissioner at the port of los angeles. prices on larger items with dwindling inventories, such as foreign cars and washing machines, are likely to rise within weeks. lumber is stacked outside at the milan lumber co. in milan, n.h. robert f. bukaty associated press for los angeles, in particular, the tariffs are coming at a very bad time, sohn said. were in kind of bad shape, because you need a lot of lumber to rebuild from the fires, and the construction hasnt started yet. itll probably start in three to four months, and thats exactly when were going to be hit by higher prices for lumber. top european union leaders have alluded to potent retaliation that could extend beyond american whiskey and hit directly at silicon valley, core to the u.s. and californian economy. and californias agricultural economy the nations largest could become a target as well. retaliatory tariffs are expected to come from nations across the world affected by the new rates, risking further response from the trump administration, thus prompting a spiral into a trade war with few winners. leaders in canada, the second largest u.s. trading partner, have said ottawa will react swiftly to any new tariff actions. but mexican president claudia sheinbaum suggested tuesday that her administration will not retaliate immediately if washington slaps new taxes on mexican imports. we dont believe in an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, because that always leads to a bad situation, sheinbaum told journalists at her daily news conference. mexican president claudia sheinbaum addresses supporters at a march 9, 2025, rally at the zocalo, mexico citys main square. eduardo verdugo associated press instead, she called for further negotiations with the u.s., even while acknowledging that she has no plans to speak to trump in the coming days. the dialogue must continue, sheinbaum said. its not a matter of you put that, so ill put that, but rather whats best for mexico. shorter-term pain trumps advisors say the new policy will bring about an overdue correction, returning fair trade practices, ultimately raising significant revenue for the federal government and bringing back manufacturing to u.s. shores. it is, in many ways, the culmination of a years-long campaign by trump to increase tariffs going back to the 1980s, when as a real estate developer and celebrity, he accused japan and china of laughing at and ripping off the united states. in his address to a joint session of congress on march 4, trump complained that countries across the globe place tariffs on u.s.-made goods. on average, the european union, china, brazil, india, mexico, and canada have you heard of them? and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. its very unfair, he said. in his first term, trump negotiated a detailed trade deal, the united states-mexico-canada agreement, that replaced the north american free trade agreement and governed trade practices among the united states and its closest trading partners. susano cordoba sells peanuts to truck drivers lining up in tijuana to cross the border into the united states on march 4, 2025. gregory bull associated press but since resuming office in january, trump has repeatedly threatened new rounds of tariffs on mexican and canadian goods, often retreating from his plans at the last moment. the on-again, off-again threat of tariffs have contributed to the instability jolting stock markets, which closed on tuesday slightly up after a day of volatile trading. allies of the white house have acknowledged that short-term pain can be expected for u.s. households in the wake of the new policy implementation, which trump has referred to as liberation day. theres absolutely going to be short-term pain, republican sen. tim sheehy of montana told cnn on monday. the presidents been clear about that. everyone has. if youre going to remodel your house to make it better in the end, its going to be really annoying in the short term, when your house is getting remodeled and theres drywall dust everywhere and theres workers in your living room, sheehy added. the reality is that remodels got to happen in order to make things stronger and more stable in the back end. already, american consumers have begun to cut back on their spending and boost their savings. a friday report from the bureau of economic analysis , a government agency, showed that the personal savings rate rose 4.6 in february. consumer spending increased just .4, after decreasing by .3 in january. leavitt added tuesday that many countries have been calling the president, asking for relief from the anticipated tariffs. she said the president is open to taking their calls. its simple if you make your product in america, you will pay no tariffs, leavitt said. it is unclear how the administration will measure the success of the new tariffs. leavitt called the stock market, which has experienced volatility in recent weeks over tariff turmoil, a snapshot in time. the white house has repeatedly pointed to companies that have newly invested in the u.s. since trump took office as evidence of tariffs working. a pause on other 25 tariffs against canada and mexico is also set to expire tuesday, and the white house would not confirm whether it would be lifted. trumps announcement comes the same day that 25 tariffs were set to take effect on auto imports at 1201 a.m. wednesday. times staff writer kate linthicum in mexico city contributed to this report.

  Title: Trump Is Defiant as Tariff Moves Roil Markets a Second Day
  Source: www.nytimes.com (2025-04-04 23:50:21)
  Content: two days after president trump announced his expansive global tariffs, the united states confronted wide-ranging and painful blowback, as china retaliated against american goods and markets plummeted again on worries of a persistent, damaging trade war. no portion of the global economy appeared unscathed as the world braced for mr. trump to begin imposing his nearly across-the-board taxes on imports saturday, marking the first salvo in a potentially costly trade conflict that the president has vigorously defended. china, which mr. trump has already hit with 20 percent tariffs, announced plans to retaliate. beijing promised to impose a 34 percent tariff on american goods next week, including on agricultural products. china calibrated its tariffs to match mr. trumps decision to add a 34 percent tax to chinese imports. the tit-for-tat delivered a huge blow to financial markets, as wall street reckoned with the rising odds of an escalating global trade standoff. by the closing bell, the sp 500 had fallen by almost 6 percent, pulling it closer into a bear market, a widely used wall street term for a decline of at least 20 percent from its peak. the tech-heavy nasdaq fell 5.8 percent, pushing it into bear market territory. as china took aim at the united states, ngozi okonjo-iweala, the director general of the world trade organization, warned on friday against a cycle of retaliatory measures that lead to further declines in trade. in the united states, jerome h. powell, the chair of the federal reserve, struck his own downbeat note over the unpredictable trajectory of the economy. while uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected, mr. powell said. the same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth. but mr. trump responded to the day of chaos by striking a defiant tone. having decamped from washington to mar-a-lago, his home in florida, he declared on truth social my policies will never change. instead, the president insisted in another post that his strategy was already working, as he held up a newly released and better-than-expected jobs report, which reflected u.s. hiring increased in the month before the announcement of his tariffs. at one point, the president even circulated another users video that argued trump is purposely crashing the market, in a bid to force the fed to lower interest rates. he later called on mr. powell to do just that, demanding that the independent chair of the central bank stop playing politics. and mr. trump eventually turned his attention to china, attacking the country for having played it wrong by retaliating against the united states. the president and his aides previously have signaled they could ratchet up their tariff rates if other nations look to exact retribution on u.s. goods. the global scramble in many ways underscored the weight of mr. trumps tariffs and the significance of his grand aspirations to recalibrate the global trading system. the white house sees these levies as critical toward resetting u.s. trade relationships, which the president contends are unfair, while boosting u.s. manufacturing and raising new revenue. but the tariffs, which are taxes on imports, threaten to fall hard on businesses that could face new costs to produce their goods. that, in turn, could hammer consumers, who are likely to shoulder the burden of any price increases. economists widely believe the result could be a rising rate of inflation, and a slowdown in consumer spending and business investment, which together crimp u.s. growth and push the economy into a recession. markets are expressing a vote of no confidence in the new tariff regime, said joe brusuelas, the principal and chief economist at the consulting firm rsm. he added that mr. trumps commentary on friday only adds to the consternation and concern that theres no strategic road map. but mr. trump and his top aides have swatted away those dour projections in recent days. fanning across cable news, they have dismissed the ebb and flow of the markets and acknowledged the possibility that tariffs could create short-term economic pain, which the president has likened to a sick patients painful yet necessary medical operation. the administration and its conservative allies have also labored to deflect criticism from economists, repeatedly portraying them as naysayers who had wrongly judged the presidents agenda in the past. i think its very clear the rhetoric of the economic community, in particular, is almost entirely ideological and out of proportion to the actual sort of risk-reward calculation, oren cass, the chief economist at american compass, a conservative economic think tank, said friday. global leaders, american politicians and others rejected that view, saying mr. trumps approach threatened to weaken the global economy and send prices soaring just as much of the world was finally returning to a sense of balance after two years of rapid inflation. ms. okonjo-iweala, the director general of the w.t.o., warned in a statement friday that mr. trumps policies could lead to an overall contraction of around 1 percent in global merchandise trade volumes this year, representing a downward revision of nearly four percentage points from previous projections. the state of california signaled it would try to negotiate its own trade deals, as gov. gavin newsom, a democrat, looked to protect local agriculture and other businesses. in a statement, mr. newsom said the presidents tactics would be felt in pretty profound ways to real people, including those who voted for donald trump and are now being betrayed by this very administration. even video games could not escape the fray japans nintendo announced that it would delay presales of its widely anticipated upcoming console, the switch 2, as it cited a need to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. mr. trump has said japan will face a 24 percent tariff on its exports to the united states. some foreign governments also mounted a last-minute scramble to figure out how, or if, to retaliate, while trying to persuade washington to relax its coming taxes on imports. maros sefcovic, the trade commissioner for the european union, said friday that he had a frank exchange with mr. trumps trade emissaries, posting on the social-media site x, i was clear us tariffs are damaging, unjustified. earlier friday, mr. trump said he had spoken by phone with to lam, the general secretary of the communist party of vietnam, which stands to see a 46 percent tariff on its exports to the united states beginning next week. by mr. trumps telling, vietnam wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s., though the president did not explicitly say if he would accept such a deal. the trump administration has sent mixed signals over its willingness to cut a deal some of mr. trumps advisers have said they do not intend to haggle, but the president himself told reporters earlier in the week that he could be open to negotiation if the united states received something phenomenal in return for relaxing tariffs. reporting was contributed by ana swanson, laurel rosenhall, colby smith, zachary small and keith bradsher.

  Title: US Investors Conserving Cash Amid Tariff Troubles
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-07 00:40:56)
  Content: last week was a rough one for the stock market following the announcement of new tariffs. but as the wall street journal wsj reported saturday april 5, investors are choosing to keep their cash close to home rather than buying shares at lower prices. during the first few days of the month, investors pumped upwards of 60 billion into money market funds, the report said. this has pushed assets in these funds to 7.4 trillion, the highest level since at least 1972. according to the report, market observers have kept an eye on cash investments in recent years, expecting that much of it would eventually move into stocks. such a shift seems to be in limbo for now, wsj added. im just sitting on as much cash as possible, said matthew shaughnessy, an investor who runs an auto repair shop and a pet spa in idaho. if i try to catch this falling knife, im just going to get cut over and over and over on the way down. before trump announced his new tariffs last week, shaughnessy said he sold his rivian and roblox stock in anticipation of a wave of selloffs. he doesnt intend to purchase additional stocks until more normal market conditions resume. for now, as pymnts wrote last week, many consumers are walking a financial tightrope, juggling everyday expenses with unexpected needs and have-it-now desires. new research from pymnts intelligence finds some surprising shifts in financial behaviors, with changes in money management habits and a growing dependence on credit to bridge the gaps in an uncertain environment. that research focused on two groups of consumers. the first are planners, who take a strategic and proactive approach, consistently paying off credit card balances, and building up savings for short-term and long-term needs. the other group are the reactors, who deal with monthly bills on the fly and in some cases choosing which bills to pay. these consumers tend to carry higher credit card balances and have less saved, making them rely more on credit when unexpected costs arise. however, the balance between those groups has begun to shift. according to new reality check the paycheck-to-paycheck report, a recent pymnts intelligence report, just 40 of consumers identified as planners in january 2025 down around 20 since february 2024, when about half of consumers 1 in 2 were planners. the decline suggests more americans are facing mounting financial strain, pymnts wrote last week. surprisingly, that shift to reactor is notable among higher-income earners making at least 100,000 a year over 11 months since february 2024, the number of planners in that group plunged by 25. were always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors. doge reportedly plans to construct mega api in irs hackathon apple reportedly keeping tiktok in store following ags reassurance tariffs add to unprecedented pressures facing small businesses president donald trump increased the previously announced tariffs on low-value packages from china after that country retaliated against the u.s. by boosting its tariffs on u.s. goods. in an executive order issued wednesday april 9, trump increased the tariffs on small parcels that he imposed tuesday april 8. beginning may 2, shipments priced up to 800 will be charged duties of 120 of their value. thats up from the 90 duty announced tuesday, according to the order. between may 2 and june 1, there will also be a per postal item duty on goods of 100. after june 1, the duty will be 200. those figures are up from the 75 and 150, respectively, that were announced tuesday, per the order. trump announced the increased tariffs on china in a wednesday post on truth social in which he also said he imposed a 125 tariff on other goods from china while ordering a pause to reciprocal tariffs on 75 countries after those countries contacted representatives of the u.s. to negotiate a solution to trade issues. based on the lack of respect that china has shown to the worlds markets, i am hereby raising the tariff charged to china by the united states of america to 125, effective immediately, trump said in the post. at some point, hopefully in the near future, china will realize that days of ripping off the u.s.a., and other countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable. it was reported wednesday, before these increases were announced, that the new tariffs on low-value packages from china could hinder the plans of ecommerce retailers like shein and temu, which have been able to compete by offering cheap products and avoiding import duties. before trump closed the loophole, chinese imports under the de minimis threshold of 800 were allowed to arrive duty-free. analysts said the closing of the de minimis loophole will upend the business models of cheap retail platforms while also slowing deliveries. on tuesday april 8, it was reported that china opposed sheins plans to move some production outside the country as a way to avoid the u.s. tariffs. were always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors. trump boosts tariffs on low-value packages again after china retaliates dogecoin foundation teams
