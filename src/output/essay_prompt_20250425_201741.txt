  Title: Karen Read's second murder trial revives debate over who killed her Boston police officer boyfriend
  Source: abcnews.go.com (2025-04-22 00:14:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article highlights the prosecution's focus on 'drinking, driving, deadly consequences,' echoing a common public safety narrative. This suggests an attempt to frame the case in a way that resonates with pre-existing public concerns, potentially influencing jury perception and minimizing focus on the defense's conspiracy claims.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the defense was prevented from implicating Colin Albert in their opening statements. This is intriguing because it suggests a limitation on the defense's ability to present their full case. What is the justification for this limitation, and how might it impact the jury's perception of the defense's claims?

  Title: Reams of documents related to L.A. County sex abuse cases never turned over, lawyers say
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:11:23)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article illustrates aspects of the Principal-Agent Problem within the context of public institutions. The county (the principal, representing the public interest) delegates authority to its probation staff (the agents). The text highlights alleged failures of the agents (abuse) and a potential failure of the principal (the county) to adequately oversee, document, and respond to these actions over decades, as evidenced by the discovery dispute and the large settlement payout. This suggests a breakdown in the mechanisms designed to ensure agents act in the best interest of the principal and those they serve.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative around AB 218 and subsequent legislative proposals (like SB 577) reflects elements of Agenda-Setting Theory. The large volume of lawsuits enabled by AB 218 (an event/policy) has forced the issue of institutional liability and financial burden onto the legislative agenda, prompting lawmakers to propose new bills aimed at managing the fallout. The framing by Senator Laird about 'restoring equilibrium' suggests an attempt to shape the public and legislative perception of the problem and the proposed solution.

  Content: thousands of documents that could contain key details about rampant childhood sexual abuse inside a defunct santa clarita detention camp including so-called grooming drawings were left scattered inside the facility and never turned over to the victims attorneys, according to a firm suing l.a. county over the decades-old incidents. as part of the preparation for a looming june trial, attorneys with law firm manly, stewart finaldi had arranged april 15 to visit camp scott, a shuttered l.a. county probation camp where many of their clients say they were sexually abused as children. inside the facility were reams of records that the county should have turned over to the firm more than a year ago through discovery, said attorney courtney thom, whose firm has about 150 civil cases alleging sexual abuse by county probation staff. you can understand my shock when im walking through where my clients got raped as children, and there are documents everywhere, thom said at a monday superior court hearing in downtown los angeles. thom said she discovered thousands of paper grievances, a locked file cabinet labeled personnel files camps a w, and a drawing she believed was signed by thomas jackson a probation deputy accused by at least 20 women of sexually assaulting them at the camp. the drawing, included in a court filing, was of the name tami in big, block orange letters and appeared to be signed by a jackson. t. attorney james sargent, who is representing the county and accompanied thom for the tour last week, called her claims inflammatory and incorrect. they want to air what they deem as dirty laundry, said sargent, who told l.a. superior court judge lawrence riff that the personnel files they discovered had nothing to do with the staff named in the lawsuits. nor did the drawing, he said. tami wilson, a former supervisor at the camp, told him she recalled being given the hand-drawn card by a youth, he wrote in a court filing. the county announced earlier this month they planned to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of alleged sexual abuse inside the countys juvenile facilities and foster homes. the settlement believed to be the largest sex abuse settlement in u.s. history arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to file civil suits against alleged predators and the agencies that employed them. a handful of prominent firms including manly, stewart finaldi declined to participate in the settlement and have ongoing litigation. in the aftermath of ab 218, state legislators have introduced several bills to attempt to make it easier for governments and school districts to deal with the financial fallout from the deluge of suits. one of these bills sb 577 is set for a hearing tuesday. the bills author, state sen. john laird, said the legislation is intended to restore some equilibrium, lessening the financial blow to public agencies while still upholding a victims right to sue. county lawyers claim one reason the state law change has had such a devastating financial toll is because many of the records they need to fight decades-old cases are long gone. attorney john manly argued the claim flew in the face of what his firm saw at camp scott. the county has been telling all of sacramento that they dont have any documents, said manly, who urged the judge to allow his firm to publicize the footage theyd taken of the heaps of documents. we need to be able to share this with legislators. riff agreed with the countys request that the videos from inside camp scott remain confidential for now due to security risks, though he instructed both sides to try to find some common ground on whether certain videos could be made public. though camp scott hasnt been used to house youths for years, sargent wrote in a filing that may soon change. l.a. county superior court judge miguel espinoza ordered the county friday to prepare to shut down los padrinos juvenile hall the countys last remaining juvenile hall, where roughly 270 youths are held due to problems stemming from chronic understaffing. the youth presently in los padrinos will need to go somewhere, and if some wind up at camp scott, the public release of photos and videos could be seriously detrimental, sargent wrote. thom noted that both reporters and television crews have been allowed to broadcast footage taken inside the camp, including a 2001 documentary, camp scott lock-up. the l.a. times has been in there to photograph, said thom. mtv videoed more than we did.

  Title: UN researchers warn that Asian scam operations are spreading across the rest of the world
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-21 15:23:50)
  Content: bangkok ap transnational organized crime groups in east and southeast asia are spreading their lucrative scam operations across the globe in response to increased crackdowns by authorities, according to a u.n. report issued on monday. for several years, scam compounds have proliferated in southeast asia, especially in border areas of cambodia, laos and myanmar, as well as in the philippines, shifting operations from site to site to stay a step ahead of the police. more recently, scam centers that have bilked victims out of billions of dollars through false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes are now being reported operating as far afield as africa and latin america. asian crime syndicates have been expanding operations deeper into remote areas with lax law enforcement that are vulnerable to the influx, according to the report issued by the u.n. office on drugs and crime or unodc. the report is titled inflection point global implications of scam centers, underground banking and illicit online marketplaces in southeast asia. this reflects both a natural expansion as the industry grows and seeks new ways and places to do business, but also a hedging against future risks should disruption continue and intensify in southeast asia, benedikt hofmann, unodcs acting regional representative for southeast asia and the pacific, said in a statement. unodc estimates that hundreds of industrial-scale scam centers generate just under 40 billion in annual profits. the trend to hedge beyond the region has been consistent with continued reports of crackdowns targeting asian-led scam centers that have been found operating in africa, south asia, the middle east and select pacific islands, as well as related money laundering, people trafficking and recruitment services discovered in europe, north america and south america. in africa, nigeria has become a hot spot, with police raids in late 2024 and early 2025 leading to many arrests, including people from east and southeast asia suspected of cryptocurrency and romance scams. zambia and angola have also busted asian-linked cyberfraud operations. in latin america, the report says that its notable that brazil has emerged as one country that has faced a growing set of challenges related to cyber-enabled fraud, online gambling, and related money laundering, with some linkages to criminal groups operating in southeast asia. it also notes that in late 2023 in peru, more than 40 malaysians were rescued after being trafficked by a taiwan-based gang known as the red dragon syndicate that forced them to commit cyber-enabled fraud. the report also points to crackdowns on asian-led scam centers in the middle east and some pacific islands. alarmingly, even as asian-led groups have been expanding the geographical scope of their operations, the involvement of criminal groups from other parts of the world is also growing, the report says. new online markets, money laundering networks, stolen data products, malware, artificial intelligence and deepfake technologies are laying the ground for the rise of crime as a service, the report says. these technological innovations facilitate conducting their businesses online and adapt to crackdowns. the convergence between the acceleration and professionalization of these operations on the one hand and their geographical expansion into new parts of the region and beyond on the other translates into a new intensity in the industry one that governments need to be prepared to respond to, hofmann says.

  Title: Is Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated (CORT) Among the Best Guru Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts?
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-23 17:17:07)
  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. we recently published a list of 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. in this article, we are going to take a look at where corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort stands against other guru stocks to invest in. wall street seems to be breathing a little easier after the initial panic over president trumps tariffs earlier this month, but the rollercoaster is not over just yet. all three major indexes closed last week in the red, with the dow and nasdaq both dipping over 2, and the broader market down more than 1. even though markets remain closed on april 18 for good friday, the general consensus is that the worst of the trade war headlines might be dying down. marko papic, chief strategist of geomacro strategy at bca research, remains cautiously optimistic, noting that while the idea of president trump striking 90 trade deals in 90 days sounds ambitious, they will likely be small, symbolic wins that still help calm markets. that said, volatility is expected to continue, and papic predicts the broader market could dip again before bouncing back, potentially giving investors a buying opportunity. investors are deep in earnings season right now, and some of wall streets biggest banks have reported solid first-quarter results. a big part of their success came from their trading desks, which cashed in on the recent market volatility, especially in equities. however, despite strong numbers on paper, bank ceos remain cautious and are hesitant to make big moves right now because of the market uncertainty. the us dollar also just had its worst weekly performance since 2022. meanwhile, investors are playing it safe and rapidly buying bonds, which pushed the 10-year treasury yield down to around 4.28. while some investors are seeing the current market dip as a buying opportunity, daniel von ahlen from globaldata ts lombard says otherwise. he believes the risks of a recession are being seriously underestimated. even though trumps recent tariff halt gave markets a bit of a boost, ahlen thinks that bounce will not last. in his view, this is not the time to scoop up stocks on the cheap, he is actually advising people to sell into rallies and avoid the usual buy-the-dip strategy. ahlen suggests getting a bit more cautious and selective. instead of jumping into the whole market, he recommends focusing on defensive sectors, like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare, that tend to hold up better in downturns. the market uncertainty is reflected in etfs as well, which are often considered wiser investment options due to active management strategies and lower risk compared to individual investing. for example, the guru etf is down 8.30 year-to-date as of april 18. however, over the last 12 months, the fund has posted share price returns of 13.38. similarly, five-year share returns stand at an impressive 51.57. guru gives retail investors a way to tap into the top stock picks of major hedge funds at a relatively low 0.75 expense ratio. it offers a more affordable and flexible way to try and beat the broader market using expert insights. so, lets take a look at the best guru stocks to buy. a biologist in a lab coat studying a culture of cells to find a cure for metabolic disorders. for this article, we looked up the guru etf, which had 82 holdings as of april 18. next, we manually searched for the average upside potential of each stock and selected 11 stocks with the highest values. the list below is ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of april 18. we have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment as of q4 2024. why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

  Title: Bank of England rate-setter says US tariffs likely to push down on inflation
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 11:13:59)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article touches upon aspects of Realism in international relations, specifically concerning trade and tariffs. The US imposing tariffs on the UK, as mentioned in the text ('the us has imposed a 10 import tariff on goods coming from the uk, a policy which also applies to many other countries'), exemplifies a state acting in its perceived self-interest to protect its economy, regardless of the impact on other nations. This action, and the UK's subsequent economic considerations, reflect the competitive and often conflictual nature of international trade relations as described by Realist theory.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents Megan Greene's analysis of potential disinflationary effects of US tariffs on the UK, but also acknowledges 'a tonne of uncertainty around this.' This uncertainty, coupled with the mention of 'both inflationary and disinflationary forces,' suggests a more complex and potentially volatile economic situation than a simple cause-and-effect narrative. What specific factors contribute most to this uncertainty, and how might they interact to produce unexpected economic outcomes?; Intriguing_angles: The opening section discusses the importance of 'parsing out the facts from the messaging' in the context of US politics, while the latter part focuses on economic analysis of UK inflation. This juxtaposition, while seemingly unrelated, could subtly imply that economic narratives are also subject to manipulation or biased framing. To what extent might political messaging influence the interpretation and presentation of economic data, and what mechanisms might facilitate such influence?

  Title: Coca-Cola under fire after bombshell report exposes ties to controversial industry: 'The cost is irreversible damage to our children's health'
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-22 11:30:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying the concept of Externalities, the article highlights how the social costs of fracking and plastic production (environmental damage, health issues) are not fully borne by the companies involved (Coca-Cola, Unilever, etc.). The text states, 'the fracking process creates environmental damage and can significantly impact local communities' and mentions 'irreversible damage to our childrens health'. This suggests a market failure where the price of plastic does not reflect its true cost to society, leading to overproduction and consumption.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Coca-Cola's 'World Without Waste' initiative but then states 'its link to fracking operations suggests it is still looking to create new plastics.' This juxtaposition creates a contradiction. What are the specific mechanisms preventing Coca-Cola from fully transitioning to recycled plastics, and could these mechanisms be related to the profitability of fracking-derived plastics?

  Title: How might Trump tariffs affect UK business on ‘Liberation Day’?

story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep

americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. liberation day as the white house grandly calls the unveiling of its new trade policy is finally upon us. but what it actually means and what the impact will be is still not clear, as president donald trump keeps businesses and world leaders waiting until wednesday to unveil the next round of tariffs. while mr trump has suggested all nations will be hit with additional levies and sir keir starmer has admitted the uk is unlikely to escape the new measures its still far from certain exactly which industries will bear the brunt this time, with steel, aluminium and auto parts already subject to additional import costs. heres a look at whats already known, what could happen, and what investors are doing as uncertainty reigns. the top end of the uk stock market has performed relatively well this year, considering concerns over growth, inflation, still-high interest rates and the wider geopolitical landscape. the ftse 100 is up more than 5 per cent year-to-date, in contrast to the us sp 500 being down around the same amount. the uncertainty has hit smaller businesses more, with the ftse 250 down 5.2 per cent in 2025 and the aim all-share index down 4.3 per cent. more recently, while there was a sell-off on monday ahead of these new tariffs, it eventually wasnt as steep as had initially looked the case and tuesday saw investors buying once more on price weaknesses, perhaps hinting that some saw limited further downside in share price terms, even with new tariffs to come. it has always been a fools game at guessing the stock markets most immediate, very next move, but aj bell analysis notes that while the biggest tech stocks in america the so-called magnificent seven have lost a combined 2.3 trillion in the first quarter of this year, they have strong growth prospects well into the future and that status makes them natural candidates to attract widespread buying when markets are more upbeat. in the uk, defence stocks in particular have fared strongly so far, with a domestic political strategy based on increased spending in this area pushing share prices higher while the price of gold, a traditional safe haven for investors, has repeatedly hit new record highs this year and is predicted by some analysts to rise even further across 2025. price hikes and job losses could have a total global economic toll of 1.4 trillion 1.1 trillion under the worst-case scenario according to aston business school. that is if full global retaliation with reciprocal tariffs is the eventual outcome, which would see the us economy in particular hit. naturally, if the entire planet is affected to that scale, the uk wouldnt be exempt, but theres still scope for changing trade paths, perhaps seeking out partners to increase back-and-forth business with if a reliance on the us is no longer plausible. quite aside from the businesses involved, government spending could also be impacted. last week, rachel reeves noted the government was laying out savings to restore 9.9bn of headroom for government expenditure. one assessment of a worst-case scenario involving trump tariffs and the uk suggests that would be entirely and immediately wiped out. david miles, from the office for budget responsibilitys obr budget responsibility committee, told mps if tariffs at 20 25 per cent were put on the uk and maintained for five years, our assessment of what that does is that it will knock out all the headroom that the government currently has. had we made that a central forecast, and had the government not changed policy at all knowing that we were going to take that as our central forecast, then the headroom would have pretty much all gone. mr miles noted the improbability of the extreme scenario, which would include a term beyond the next us presidential elections, but the obr further noted the hit to business confidence across the uk caused by the uncertainty around tariffs and other costs. at the other end of the scale, theres the perspective that some changes could in fact mean the uk might actually benefit from a trade war. again, its important to note thats on a broad, all-encompassing term there would still be businesses or industries negatively affected within that. but the obr noted that if the uk avoided involvement in a trade war, reciprocal tariffs and the like, some redirected trade flows could end up increasing business this side of the water. much of that is based around the fact that the uk-us trade deficit is far more reasonably balanced than, for example, the eu-us one. professor irina surdu-nardella, of warwick business school, told cnbc tariffs could yet have a limited impact on the uk. effects would be relatively limited to industries such as fishing and mining, ms surdu-nardella said, pointing to the service-focused nature of the uk economy meaning much of it would be unscathed by import tariffs. of course, theres also the possibility that mr trump and mr starmer find an agreement whereby british companies end up entirely unaffected by the whole process, potentially giving them a foothold to gain further business with overseas customers. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see

  Title: Trump ‘Liberation Day’ live: President set to unveil secret tariff plan as world braces for its economic impact
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-02 14:47:57)
  Content: all eyes are on president trump as he prepares to reveal the next phase of his sweeping tariff agenda, leaving global markets fearing a trade war from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which

other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. donald trump is preparing to unveil a raft of new tariffs on wednesday afternoon in what the president has repeatedly billed as liberation day. trump has promised to roll out reciprocal dollar-for-dollar tariffs on nations that levy duties on u.s. goods as part of an aggressive attempt to fulfill his administrations america first agenda and correct years of what he deems unfair trade. international markets wait tentatively as the president is expected to unveil his plans at 4 p.m. wednesday at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden at the moment american markets close. plans remain under wraps with trumps team reportedly weighing options through tuesday. however, white house press secretary karoline leavitt stated that the president had already decided his course of action and that the tariffs would go into effect almost immediately. the only way to avoid the new levies, she said, is to move production to the u.s. it follows the liberal candidate for a critical seat on the wisconsin supreme court, susan crawford, who defeated conservative brad schimel in a race seen as a referendum on trump and his billionaire adviser elon musk. former republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is on board with an effort by democrats in the upper chamber led by senators tim kaine, amy klobuchar, and mark warner to end donald trumps made-up emergency that the president has declared against canada allowing him authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on the u.s.s northern neighbor. trump claims the authority by declaring a national emergency caused by the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migration from canada as well as mexico and china. president trump is saying that there is an emergency with canada. canada is a friend, not an adversary. canada is a sovereign nation, not a 51st state, senator kaine of virginia said on tuesday. this morning, cnns haley talbot reports that the list of republicans who will vote yes on a tariffs resolution up for a vote today at around 7 p.m. has grown to include the former gop leader of the senate. kaine said he approached mcconnell last night and didnt even get to the question before the kentucky senator said im with you. other republicans in support of the move to at least symbolically rebuke the president on his trade policy just a few hours after his liberation day announcement on reciprocal tariffs expected to cover a large swathe of u.s. trading partners include senators susan collins, lisa murkowski, and rand paul. senator thom tillis also told cnn that he doesnt plan on voting for kaines resolution, but has some concerns with the trade policies being discussed, adding, we need to see what comes out tomorrow wednesday and be instructed by that before we take action. earlier, trump wrote in part on truth social mitch mcconnell of kentucky, susan collins of maine, lisa murkowski of alaska, and rand paul, also of kentucky, will hopefully get on the republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize canada for the sale, into our country, of large amounts of fentanyl, by tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy. they are playing with the lives of the american people, and right into the hands of the radical left democrats and drug cartels. the senate bill is just a ploy of the dems to show and expose the weakness of certain republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the house will never approve it and i, as your president, will never sign it. after breaking the record for the longest senate speech in history, cory booker now seems to have broken the internet, with a slew of praise, memes and even tiktok videos commemorating his mammoth achievement. the new jersey democrat took to the senate floor on monday evening, saying he would remain there as long as he was physically able. the speech lasted a whopping 25 hours and 5 minutes. mike bedigan looks at some of the online reactions. it was fitting that cory booker was recounting a story about the late civil rights leader john lewis as he entered the 19th minute and 24th hour of a historic speech to the senate on tuesday evening. in that moment, the first black senator for new jersey broke a record for the longest speech ever made in congress, one that was set 67 years ago by the segregationist democrat strom thurmond, who spoke for a day and a night in opposition to the civil rights act. overcome with emotion, booker looked up to the ceiling and touched his heart as his fellow democrats in the chamber applauded his effort. one of msnbcs morning joe hosts is delighting in the fact that the wisconsin supreme court candidate backed by elon musks lost - even after the tech mogul dumped millions into the race. wisconsin voters elected liberal justice susan crawford to the states supreme court on tuesday, beating brad schimel by more than 200,000 votes in the most expensive judicial election in u.s. history. the vote keeps the high courts 4-3 liberal majority intact. musk repeatedly played up the stakes of the election, claiming it will direct the destiny of humanity and the future of the world is at stake. now, morning joe host joe scarborough is reveling in the massive loss musk suffered. katie hawkinson reports from washington, d.c. the u.s. has sent a three-person team to myanmar to help respond to the 7.7-magnitude earthquake, in a move criticized as weak and irrelevant by a former aid official. much larger russian and chinese teams have already been helping search-and-rescue efforts in the country for days. steffie banatvala reports. a mother and her three children were wrongfully detained by immigration enforcement agents in new york and taken to a detention facility in texas, a nonprofit says as it calls for their release. immigration and customs enforcement officers detained the mother - whose birth country was not disclosed - and her kids, one of whom is in third grade, on march 27 while they were executing an arrest on a farm in sackets harbor, new york, according to the new york immigration coalition. kelly rissman reports. elon musk broke his silence after suffering defeat in the wisconsin supreme court race, which cemented a liberal majority for the next three years. susan crawfords win keeps the court under a 4-3 liberal majority in the face of crucial litigation surrounding abortion access, voting rights and redistricting. like president donald trump, musk chose to focus on the background win of wisconsin voters approving the constitutional amendment to enshrine voter id laws, a vote that was being held at the same time as the supreme court race. this was the most important thing, musk posted on x in response to a post on voter id. madeline sherratt has the full story. kelly loeffler, former georgia senator and now head of the small business administration in the trump administration, hailed donald trumps liberation day as the single greatest salvation, for not just small businesses, but for america, during an appearance on fox business this morning. the president eagerly posted a clip of her conversation with maria bartiromo to his truth social account italys prime minister giorgia meloni and the countrys top business lobby warned on wednesday that impending u.s. tariffs could significantly impact the nations exports and its already struggling economy. it is clear that the introduction of new tariffs would have heavy repercussions for italian producers, meloni said while hosting a prize-giving ceremony for italian cuisine in rome. meloni added that she did not rule out adequate responses to protect the exports of the euro zones third largest economy, though she did not provide further details. italy recorded a trade surplus with the united states of 39 billion euros 42.14 billion in 2024, the third largest in the 20-nation euro area, according to eurostat data. earlier on wednesday, the business association confindustria reported that italys economy is expected to grow by 0.6 this year, half of the governments official target and down from a 0.9 forecast made by the group in october. the economy expanded by a modest 0.7 in both 2024 and 2023. it managed to achieve 0.1 growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the previous three months, after stagnating in the third quarter. most analysts do not foresee any significant rebound in the near term. confindustria indicated that while its forecasts accounted for the already-announced u.s. tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as what it termed record levels of uncertainty regarding trade policy, they did not consider the effects of an escalating trade war. in a worst-case scenario, with permanent 25 u.s. tariffs on all imports, rising to 60 for china, coupled with retaliatory measures against u.s. exports, italys growth could decline to around 0.2 this year, it said. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Trump warned US economy to be hit hardest by tariff war: Live updates - The Independent
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 15:31:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Realism, one might interpret the trade policy discussions as reflecting a state-centric view where national economic gain is prioritized, potentially at the expense of global stability. The text notes the 'aggressive tariff plans' and the claim that they 'would produce great benefits for american workers' while simultaneously acknowledging the negative impact on 'nearly all countries' and the risk of 'global recession'. This aligns with a realist perspective where states pursue self-interest in a competitive international system, viewing economic interactions through a zero-sum lens.; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory appears relevant in examining how specific issues gain prominence. The article highlights media reports (NBC News, Bloomberg, BBC) focusing on the Hegseth information leak and the economic consequences of tariffs, alongside official statements (Leavitt on student loans, Vance on tariffs, Bessent on China). This suggests that the selection and emphasis of these topics by both media and officials shape the public agenda, potentially diverting attention from or amplifying certain narratives over others.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents conflicting or potentially erroneous naming conventions for administration officials. Textual Basis: It refers to a 'press secretary karoline hegseth' and later 'white house press secretary karoline leavitt', and mentions 'treasury secretary scott bessent' immediately after discussing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a way that could cause confusion. Significance: Such inconsistencies, if not simple typos, could suggest reporting errors or a lack of clarity in official communication, potentially impacting the perceived reliability of the information presented. Probing Questions: Are these naming variations indicative of reporting inaccuracies, and how might such details influence a reader's trust in the overall narrative? What does the juxtaposition of the Defense Secretary and Treasury Secretary discussions imply about the article's structure or underlying connections the author perceives?

fund, told the bbc on tuesday. the u.s. economy will be one of the hardest hit by the aggressive tariff plans, the imf warned earlier in the day as it slashed forecasts for global economic growth, with the u.s. dropping to just 1.8 percent, from a previous forecast of 2.7 percent. the global economic growth forecast was cut by half a percentage point, with downgrades in nearly all countries amid ongoing uncertainty from the trump administrations trade policy. this came after vice president jd vance admitted that president donald trumps aggressive tariff increases will profoundly change the u.s. economy and other nations. in a speech in india, vance said the rebalancing from aggressive tariffs would produce great benefits for american workers. earlier, gold prices surged to a record high while the value of the u.s dollar plunged, following trumps latest attack on the federal reserve chair jerome powell. press secretary karoline hegseth was asked about embattled defense secretary pete hegseth at todays white house briefing. she told reporters that president donald trump continues to stand behind hegseth. white house press secretary karoline leavitt has announced that the education department will resume involuntary collections for defaulted student loans on may 5th. they will recoup loans and go after tax refunds, federal pensions and even their wages, of those who owe money. if you take out a loan, you have to pay it back very simple, leavitt said. defense secretary pete hegseth pulled the airstrike information he posted into signal chats with his wife, brother and dozens of others from a secure communications channel used by u.s. central command, raising new questions as to whether the embattled pentagon head leaked classified information over an open, unsecured network. nbc news first reported that the launch times and bomb drop times of u.s. warplanes that were about to strike houthi targets in yemen details that multiple officials have said is highly classified were taken from secure u.s. central command communications. a person familiar with the second chat confirmed that to the associated press. press secretary karoline leavitt confirmed

if president donald trump doesnt retreat on his tariffs, the chance of a u.s. recession and subsequent global recession is almost 100 percent. rogoff was speaking to bbc radio 4s pm programme in the u.k. today. defense secretary pete hegseth doubled down during a tuesday morning fox and friends interview, insisting that the information on airstrike launches and bomb drop times that he shared with his wife, brother, and dozens of others in two separate signal chats was not classified. hegseth didnt deny the existence of a separate chat instead, he attacked the media and his former staff, whom he accused of leaking information about the chats. his repeat denial comes as nbc news reported tuesday that the information hegseth posted came directly from secure communications from the head of u.s. central command, gen. erik kurilla. the pentagons inspector general is investigating the chats. the material kurilla sent included details about when u.s. fighters would take off and when they would hit their targets details that could, if they fell into the wrong hands, put the pilots of those fighters in grave danger. but he was doing exactly what he was supposed to providing hegseth, his superior, with information he needed to know and using a system specifically designed to safely transmit sensitive and classified information. but then hegseth used his personal phone to send some of the same information kurilla had given him to at least two group text chats on the signal messaging app, three u.s. officials with direct knowledge of the exchanges told nbc news. the sequence of events, which has not previously been reported, could raise new questions about hegseths handling of the information, which he and the government have denied was classified. in all, according to the two sources, less than 10 minutes elapsed between kurillas giving hegseth the information and hegseths sending it to the two group chats, one of which included other cabinet-level officials and their designees and, inadvertently, the editor of the atlantic magazine. one of them was composed of hegseths wife, brother and attorney and some of his aides. treasury secretary scott bessent told a closed-door investor summit tuesday that the tariff standoff with china is unsustainable and that he expects the situation to de-escalate, bloomberg reports. bessent made the remarks at a jpmorgan chase event on the sidelines of the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings in washington, d.c. he added that negotiations between the u.s. and china have not yet started but that a deal is possible, according to people who attended his session, which wasnt open to the public or media. u.s. stocks rose after his comments, with the sp 500 index gaining as much as 2.9 as of 1228

street opened on thursday morning after donald trump unveiled his latest wave of tariffs on what the president called liberation day. trumps announcement sent shockwaves through markets around the globe, and shortly after the bell rang at the new york stock exchange, the dow jones industrial average fell 1,150 points or 2.7. the sp 500 dropped more than 3, and the tech-focused nasdaq more than

trading hours closed in the u.s. about 60 countries deemed the worst offenders including china where a majority of apples devices are manufactured face higher reciprocal levies nearing, in some cases, 50 percent leaving world leaders reeling. the baseline tariffs go into effect on saturday and reciprocal tariffs on wednesday. meanwhile, four republican senators joined every democratic senator in a resolution to oppose trumps tariffs against canada. the senate passed the resolution crafted by kentucky senator rand paul 51-48 on wednesday after trumps announcement. a senate hearing devolved into chaos after sen. ted cruz repeatedly spoke over sen. amy klobuchar as the pair exchanged barbs over nationwide injunctions inhibiting president donald trumps agenda. during wednesdays hearing, the texas lawmaker excoriated federal judges and declared that nationwide injunctions are an abuse of power. cruzs comments come as republicans are attempting to pass a bill to limit judicial rulings against the trump administration. james liddell reports. andrew feinberg and katie hawkinson report from washington, d.c. far-right activist laura loomer met with president donald trump and pressed

donald trumps ability to impose tariffs and requiring congressional approval for new levies within 60 days. republican senator chuck grassley and democrat maria cantwell presented a bill that mandates the president to notify congress about new tariffs, providing an explanation of the rationale along with an analysis of the potential impact on u.s. businesses and consumers. congress must pass a joint resolution of approval for the new tariff within 60 days otherwise, all new tariffs on imports would expire. this bill reasserts congress role over trade policy to ensure rules-based trade policies are transparent, consistent, and benefit the american public, cantwell said. as representatives of the american people, congress has a duty to stop actions that will cause them harm. the bill is based on the war powers resolution of 1973 and aims to reestablish limits on the presidents authority to impose unilateral tariffs without congressional approval. for too long, congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch, grassley said. grassleys home state of iowa relies significantly on farm crop exports, whereas

  Title: Trump claims U.S. industry ‘reborn’ as he imposes sweeping tariffs on his highly touted ‘Liberation Day’
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-02 21:42:53)
  Content: president falsely claims that tariffs will be paid by foreign countries even though they are paid by american importers and passed on to consumers as higher prices from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. donald trump has announced an across-the-board tax on all imported goods purchased by americans and additional taxes on imports from countries which officials deem to be placing unfair barriers on the importation or sale of american goods. the president unveiled the measures on what he called liberation day, in an effort to forcibly undo decades of globalization and reindustrialize a u.s. economy that has become increasingly dominated by services and knowledge-based work in recent years. speaking at a long-anticipated event in the white house rose garden, trump said wednesday would forever be remembered as the day american industry was reborn, the day americas destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make america wealthy again. after a series of whipsaw days in the market ever since trump began his saber rattling about tariffs on mexico, canada and just about any other country, making the announcement after markets closed made sense to prevent a large market sell-off or a decline in stocks. he announced that starting at midnight, american will at minimum pay what he called a 10 percent baseline tariff on all imports to help rebuild our economy and to prevent cheating. but trump went further by announcing how americans would, starting in just a few days, face the effects of his administration imposing 54 percent taxes on all chinese imports a new 34 percent tax plus the 20 percent tax that is already in place, 20 percent on all imports from european union countries, 32 percent on imports from vietnam, 24 percent on imports from japan, using what white house officials described as a formula that bases the tax rates on americas trade deficits. he also claimed that foreign nations would finally be asked to pay for the privilege of access to our market, the biggest market in the world, even though foreign countries do not pay tariffs because tariffs are taxes paid by american importers and often passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. its unclear whether trump, a billionaire whose administration is staffed with some of the wealthiest people in the united states, understands the pain his administrations policies could impose on voters who elected him to bring prices down, though he did say americans might have to go through a little tough love as a result of the new tariffs. as he sought to explain and justify his policies, the president painted a morose and depressing picture of americas world-leading economic position as having been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike for decades and said he was signing an executive order that amounts to our declaration of economic independence that would make america great again, greater than ever before by taxing americans without a single vote cast in congress. he claimed the reciprocal tariffs import taxes paid by american importers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices will let his administration use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt. jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country, and you see it happening already. we will supercharge our domestic industrial base. we will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers, and ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers. this will be, indeed, the golden age of america. its coming back. were going to come back very strongly, he said. trump then accused some of americas closest allies of having taken advantage of american generosity by having their own domestic industries while not adopting policies to encourage consumers to purchase american products, particularly with automobiles. he said his administration will impose a 25 percent import tax on any foreign-made automobiles starting at midnight on thursday while castigating south korea and japan for not buying enough american cars. in many cases, the friend is worse than the foe in terms of trade, but such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base and put our national security at risk, he said. the president accused american allies of having ripped off the united states and harmed american workers, who he said have watched in anguish as foreign leaders stole american jobs. foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful american dream, he said. in remarks that alternated between bellicosity and historical and economic illiteracy, the president claimed america had suffered a decline in national wealth because of the imposition of income taxes starting in 1913, rather than the tariffs that had financed federal operations during americas early years when the countrys central government was far more limited in scope. for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax so that citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run our government, trump said, again deliberately repeating his false claim about tariffs being paid by foreign governments rather than americans. he went on to suggest that the great depression following the 1929 stock market crash could have been avoided had the income tax never been instituted and claimed wrongly that the u.s. would have had a much different story had the disastrous smoot-hawley tariff of 1930 been permitted to save our country. administration officials routinely describe trumps unilateral tax increases as his fulfilment of campaign promises to bring manufacturing back to american shores, even as his use of tariffs has alienated some of the countrys closest allies and roiled financial markets over his first three months in the white house. almost all mainstream economists and financial experts have decried his policies as the opposite of what the u.s. needs to bring down the record inflation that has plagued american consumers over the last three years. but the presidents top aides, including commerce secretary howard lutnick, u.s. trade representative jamieson greer and white house trade adviser peter navarro have indulged his taste for tariffs despite pleas for him to stop from business leaders. a senior administration official who briefed reporters on trumps plans described the united states the worlds largest economy as a helpless victim of nefarious conspiracies by allies and trading partners and said the rest of the world punishes us not only with their own tariffs but with higher non-tariff barriers the official called far worse, such as currency manipulation that tax distortions, dumping and export subsidies, punitive technical barriers, ridiculous agricultural constraints, sweatshop labor, pollution havens, widespread counterfeiting and intellectual property theft. as bad as the higher tariffs are, the non-tariff barriers are worse maybe a lot worse, said the official, who spoke to reporters on the call about what he described as decades of failure in reporting on globalizations pitfalls, as well as what he called false predictions that the tariffs trump imposed during his first term would cause inflation. a second official stated that trumps announcement would mark the start of a new era in a way that the world has not seen since the u.s. helped establish the post-second world war international trading order, including by helping found the world trade organization and other international organizations that he mocked as no longer fit for our time in our economic situation. nearly every major metric by which to measure the economy shows that not only would the tariffs fall onto the consumer, but that it could also lead to a word economists dread stagflation, wherein prices rise while unemployment also spikes. inflation kills re-election prospects, as president joe biden and nearly every other major world leader learned in 2024 as part of a global anti-incumbent wave. but stagflation is cataclysmic, as the late president jimmy carter could have told trump. but the white house has insisted that this would not be inflationary. the atlanta federal reserves gdpnow model projected that gross domestic product would contract by 3.7 percent, which is lower than it was last week. the institute for supply management reported on tuesday that economic activity contracted in march. but markets and the federal reserve are not the only group becoming nervous about this. even a handful of republican senators are revolting against the tariffs. sen. rand paul, an idiosyncratic libertarian republican from kentucky, teamed up with sen. tim kaine, a democrat from virginia, to repeal trumps tariffs with canada. but other republicans are also nervous about it, particularly republicans from swing states. ahead of the announcement, sen. thom tillis of north carolina, perhaps the most endangered republican incumbent, explained his concerns despite the fact he said he wont support kaine and pauls bill. im assuming worst case scenario, the likely retaliations in the way theyll affect farm country, and in my case, specifically north carolina, access to markets, he told the independent, adding he wanted to see that every single possible contingency and retaliatory measure has been anticipated. perhaps mindful of this, trump waited to announce his liberation day reciprocal tariffs until 400 pm on wednesday. he did not choose that time by accident. trump chose that specific time because it would come just as the new york stock exchange rang its closing bell to end day trading. sen. chuck grassley of iowa said he worried about a 25 percent tariff on potash, which is used to grow corn and soybeans, from canada, adding he wanted to see if he could get a waiver on potash. the nature of trumps tariffs policy meant that even up to the final minute, even some republicans did not know what would happen. do you even know that theyre going into play today? sen. lisa murkowski of alaska, whose state borders canada, asked the independent in response to a question. i dont either. so hold on tight. markets will likely be holding on tight as well come opening bell on thursday morning. trump has effectively bet his entire legacy on the tariffs, ensuring that it will usher in his proposed new golden age of american prosperity. but as of right now, the world, markets and even many in his own party remain unconvinced. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and

  Title: S&P 500 nears bear market, as highest tariffs in a century threaten trade
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-08 22:57:16)
  Content: the stock market staged a brief rally tuesday on hopes that president donald trump would turn from raising tariffs to cutting deals, before sinking amid renewed tough talk by administration officials. the sp 500 index closed down 1.5 percent, bringing its total loss since the mid-february start of trumps trade offensive to almost 20 percent, the official indication of a bear market. stocks jumped nearly 4 percent in the first hour of trading, after treasury secretary scott bessent told cnbc that nearly 70 countries had approached the united states about negotiating over trade barriers. the next escalation of u.s. tariffs was just hours away. but the president fueled the upbeat mood with a subsequent social media post, describing a great call with south koreas acting president about a potential bargain. yet the market rebound soon fizzled. on capitol hill, some of the presidents top aides sought to clarify the trade wars murky parameters. jamieson greer, the presidents chief trade negotiator, described the nations 1.2 trillion trade deficit as an emergency that required urgent efforts to reshape the u.s. economy. greer brushed aside lawmakers complaints about potential costs to consumers and businesses, telling the senate finance committee, the president is fixed in his purpose. bessent, meanwhile, sought to calm republican fears that trumps bare-knuckled assault on the global trading system might trigger a politically lethal recession. during an hour-long meeting hosted by house majority whip tom emmer r-minnesota, bessent briefed lawmakers and jay timmons, the head of the national association of manufacturers, on the administrations plans for a manufacturing revival. one week after trumps announcement of the highest import taxes in more than a century, investors, companies and lawmakers continue trying to make sense of his ultimate goal. for now, the administration says the president is advancing on twin tracks raising tariffs to encourage manufacturers to return to the united states, while fielding offers by other nations to lower their barriers to u.s. products. despite swelling criticism from lawmakers and chief executives, the administration appears vindicated by the eagerness of foreign leaders hoping to avert u.s. tariffs by making a deal with trump. in her daily briefing for reporters, white house press secretary karoline leavitt struck a combative tone. america does not need other countries as much as other countries need us, she said. the presidents high-risk strategy is already paying off, according to greer, who cited recent investment announcements by automakers and other manufacturers planning to expand their u.s. operations. likewise, officials from argentina, vietnam and israel have indicated they will drop their tariff and regulatory barriers to u.s. exports. greer and other administration officials are engaged in talks with countries such as japan and south korea. but there is no immediate prospect of talks with the nation at the center of u.s. trade complaints china. after china imposed a 34 percent tariff on u.s. goods, in retaliation for trumps april 2 announcement, the president added an additional 50 percent tax on top of his earlier moves. as of 1201 a.m. wednesday, american importers of some chinese products will pay a tax of up to 129 percent. greer said the administration was disappointed with chinas failure to comply with the 2020 phase one trade deal trump signed in his first term, which committed beijing to make substantial purchases of u.s. farm, energy and manufactured goods. amid the disruption of the pandemic, which erupted within weeks of the white house signing ceremony for the deal, china fell short of its commercial promises. after trump said he would impose the additional 50 percent tariff, chinas commerce ministry called the presidents move a mistake on top of a mistake. if the united states waged a trade war against china, it would fight to the end, the ministry said. administration official say they have the advantage over chinese president xi jinping, since americans buy roughly three times as much from china as the chinese buy from u.s. companies. trump said china panicked in opting to retaliate for his tariffs. the president believes that xi and china want to make a deal. they just dont know how to get that started, leavitt told reporters. the administrations unruly nature, however, is shadowing the presidents policy aims. growing acrimony between elon musk, the worlds richest man, and peter

  Title: Trump’s tariffs may be reduced but their impact will be felt in the UK and beyond
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-10 05:00:21)
  Content: donald trump may have stepped back from his huge tariff rises on every country, except china, which now faces at least 145, but the impact of the market chaos is likely to continue in the uk and beyond. the rest of the world still faces a blanket 10 tariff on all us exports. while much of the focus has been the direct impact of the tariffs on physical goods, trumps actions threaten to reach every corner of global finance and the economy. here, we examine the potential consequences of the tariffs and the fallout, from derailing deals and further undermining londons stock exchange, to risking a rise in corruption and pushing up prices for consumers. falling global growth view image in fullscreen workers make garments for export at a workshop in jiangsu province, china. photograph nurphotogetty the leading economic forecasters have yet to give their verdict, but the international monetary fund has already said the trade war will damage trade and business investment in most countries. china could fail to meet its 5 growth target for 2025, while germany could be pushed into recession. the uk is likely to escape relatively unscathed in terms of trade. uk goods exports to the us are significant, but businesses are expected to minimise the impact of tariffs, leading to a modest 0.1 percentage point reduction in uk gdp this year. however, with borrowing costs still high and consumer confidence at risk, the tariffs present a significant headache for keir starmer. soaring inflation and lower rates central banks have spent much of the past three years attempting to reduce inflation, which reached as high as 11 after russias full-scale invasion of ukraine in 2022. trumps tariffs threaten to send costs for consumers surging. it is why the eu and the uk have proved reluctant to respond in kind to washingtons barrage of tariffs. some estimates say us inflation currently at 2.8 could peak at 4.5 next year if tariffs remain in place and that the chances of a us recession have increased. to tackle this, central banks across the uk and europe are widely expected to cut rates soon to protect their economies. the us federal reserve has not signalled that interest rate cuts are on the way in the us, but it may be forced to if growth slows as anticipated. stock market listing delays view image in fullscreen it may take the china-founded, fast-fashion retailer shein longer to charge ahead with plans for a float on the london stock exchange photograph bloomberggetty the city has been waiting patiently for a market rebound that would help unleash pent-up plans for floats by some of the uks biggest fintech firms, including neobanks such as revolut, monzo and starling. the fintech lobby group innovate finance even convened a unicorn council in 2024 that has been loosely referred to as a group of uk companies seen as ipo candidates. the swedish buy now, pay later giant klarnas 15bn new york float was seen as imminent, with the company widely expected to launch an investor roadshow this week. but as a result of the market turmoil it has failed to announce any further progress. there are also questions about how long it may take for the china-founded, fast-fashion retailer shein to charge ahead with plans for a controversial float on the london stock exchange. shein reportedly filed papers with britains markets regulator in early june last year, though a date for its potential float has yet to be set. the valuation of the float has reportedly been cut from the 64bn-plus it had previously hoped for. meanwhile, the italian fashion group prada has reportedly negotiated a discount of more than 200m 156m on the purchase of versace in light of the trade war, the financial times reported. junk bonds the us investment firm blackrock has given junk bonds a clean bill of health, saying the loans made by companies that use them as a lifeline are not threatened by trumps tariffs. a junk bond is a grade of loan that pays a high interest rate because ratings agencies consider them risky. the two largest department stores in the us, saks and neiman, came together at the end of 2024 in a buyout funded by a 2.2bn junk bond paying 11 interest. there are other retailers in the us that almost exist just to finance their loans. however, choppy markets have left investors considering the implications of high tariff rates on deals in new york, freezing debt refinancing arrangements, bloomberg reported. skip past newsletter promotion sign up to business today free daily newsletter get set for the working day well

partner as it seeks to secure fresh equity funding for its operations by the end of june, staving off nationalisation. it is understood the money is already in place. however, kkrs investment committee has a veto and the deal could be scuppered if the tariff war triggers further turmoil on financial markets. that said, kkr was part of a consortium that reached a 1.6bn deal to buy the nhs landlord assura on wednesday. banks preparing for bad debts profits at banks across the world could take a hit, with tariffs affecting business borrowers and large corporate clients that sell products to the us. it could dampen appetite for loans and weigh on demand for investment banking services, which help execute mergers and acquisitions, as well as fundraising through financial markets including ipos. but a drop in revenues could make it harder for companies to repay their debts. that could, in turn, force banks to start putting aside money for potential defaults in their first-quarter results, which are due later this month. natwest privatisation delayed the governments stake in natwest group the bank formerly known as royal bank of scotland has been rapidly dwindling, having fallen to 3.95 at the end of march as the government took advantage of the lenders strong share price. it fuelled speculation that the bank could be weeks away from completely ditching its taxpayer-owned shares. however, market ructions caused by the tariff backlash have likely put a temporary pause on the state sell-down, as the government aims to recoup as much of its cash as possible. the uk government originally spent 46bn bailing out rbs at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, leaving taxpayers owning about 84 of the lender. natwest shares have struggled to return to the 500p paid by the government 17 years ago, but managed to hit 480p in early march. increased corruption mary lovely, a trade expert at the peterson institute in washington, has raised the prospect of widespread fraud at us ports and airports as customs officials wrestle with a complicated tariff regime affecting tens of thousands of imported goods. the situation will get worse for border staff if trump scraps the de-minimis rule that allowed goods valued at less than 800 to enter the us tariff free. there could be huge pressure on customs officials from importers to wave through shipments for a fee to escape high tariffs.

  Content: file photo chuyuss shutterstock palm beach, floridabeijingwashington, april 4 reuters china announced additional tariffs of 34 on u.s. goods on friday, the most serious escalation in a trade war with president donald trump that has fed fears of a recession and triggered a global stock market rout. in the standoff between the worlds top two economies, beijing also announced controls on exports of some rare earths, while trump doubled down as well, vowing not to change course. china added 11 u.s. bodies to the unreliable entity list, which allows beijing to take punitive actions against foreign entities, including firms linked to arms sales to democratically governed taiwan, which china claims as part of its territory. other impacted nations like canada have also readied retaliation in a mounting trade war after trump raised u.s. tariff barriers to their highest level in more than a century, leading to a plunge in world financial markets. investment bank jp morgan said it now sees a 60 chance of the global economy entering recession by year end, up from 40 previously. wall street fell sharply at the opening on friday, after china retaliated with fresh tariffs a day after the trump administrations sweeping levies knocked off 2.4 trillion from u.s. equities. china comes out swinging with an aggressive response to trumps tariffs, said stephane ekolo, market equity strategist, tradition, london. this is significant and is unlikely to be over, hence the negative market reactions. investors are afraid of a tit for tat trade war situation. trumps team has played down the market turbulence as an adjustment that would prove beneficial in the long run. to the many investors coming into the united states and investing massive amounts of money, my policies will never change. this is a great time to get rich, richer than ever before! trump said in a social media post in all caps. after beijings retaliation, he posted that china played it wrong, they panicked the one thing they cannot afford to do! trump on thursday had said he was open to talking to china and making a deal over tiktok by providing relief for u.s. tariffs on chinese goods in exchange for beijings approval of the sale of the byte dance-owned short video app. speaking to reporters on air force one, trump said it was just an example and did not answer a question on whether plans were underway for him to talk to chinese president xi jinping. shares of big tech stocks fell in premarket trading, with companies such as apple aapl.o and nvidia nvda.o having big exposure to china and taiwan for manufacturing their products. in japan, one of united states top trading partners, prime minister shigeru ishiba said the tariffs had created a national crisis as a plunge in banking shares on friday set tokyos stock market on course for its worst week in years. u.s. secretary of state marco rubio on friday disputed any economic crash, telling reporters that markets were reacting to the change and would adjust. their economies are not crashing. their markets are reacting to a dramatic change in the global order in terms of trade, he said at a press conference in brussels. the markets will adjust. federal reserve chair jerome powell on friday will add his voice to a growing debate at the central bank over whether the trump administrations new policies are more likely to stoke higher inflation or undercut growth and employment so much the fed will have to respond. with european shares also tumbling to the biggest weekly losses in years, the european unions trade commissioner maros sefcovic will speak to u.s. counterparts. we will not shoot from the hip we want to give negotiations every chance to succeed to find a fair deal, to the benefit of both sides, he said on social media. the eu is divided on how best to respond to trumps tariffs. countries that are cautious about retaliating and thereby raising the stakes in the standoff with the u.s. include ireland, italy, poland and the scandinavian nations. french president emmanuel macron led the charge on thursday by calling on companies to freeze investment in the u.s. however, french finance minister eric lombard later cautioned against like-for-like countermeasures on the u.s. tariffs, warning this would also rebound on european consumers. the u.s. tariffs could jack up the price for u.s. shoppers of everything from cannabis to running shoes to apples iphone. a high-end iphone could cost nearly 2,300 if apple passes the costs on to consumers, based on projections from rosenblatt securities. china is retaliating for trumps 54 tariffs on imports from the worlds no. 2 economy. the european union faces a 20 duty. others have maybe learned their lessons from trumps last term, said eddie kennedy, head of bespoke discretionary fund management, marlborough, london. they are fighting back and saying we can play the same game as you and we are more in a position of strength to negotiate. trump says the reciprocal tariffs are a response to barriers put on u.s. goods, while administration officials said the tariffs would create manufacturing jobs at home and open up export markets abroad, although they cautioned it would take time to see results. reporting by reuters newsrooms writing by matthias williams editing by toby chopra c thomson reuters 2025. sign up for gcaptains newsletter and never miss an update essential maritime and offshore news, insights, and updates delivered daily straight to your inbox dive into a sea of curated content with our weekly dispatch email. your personal maritime briefing awaits!

  Content: atlanta ap trump administration officials were out in force across the television networks sunday defending president donald trumps economic policies after another week of reeling markets that saw the republican administration reverse course on some of its steepest tariffs. trump, meanwhile, said on his social media platform that there ultimately will be no exemptions for his sweeping tariff agenda, disputing characterizations that he has granted tariff exceptions for certain electronics, including smart phones, whose production is concentrated in china. rather, trump said, those products are subject to the existing 20 fentanyl tariffs, and they are just moving to a different tariff bucket. white house advisers and cabinet members tried to project confidence and calm amid trumps on-again, off-again approach to tariffs on imported goods from around the world. but their explanations about the overall agenda, coupled with trumps latest statements, also reflected shifting narratives from a president who, as a candidate in 2024, promised an immediate economic boost and lower prices but now asks american businesses and consumers for patience. a week ago, trumps team stood by his promise to leave the impending tariffs in place without exceptions. they used their latest news show appearances to defend his move to ratchet back to a 10 universal tariff for most nations except china 145, while seeming to grant exemptions for certain electronics like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and semiconductor chips. here are the highlights of what trump lieutenants said last week vs. sunday there are varying answers on the purpose of the tariffs long before launching his first presidential campaign in 2015, trump bemoaned the offshoring of u.s. manufacturing. his promise is to reindustrialize the united states and eliminate trade deficits with other countries. last week commerce secretary howard lutnick, interviewed on cbs face the nation, played up national security. youve got to realize this is a national security issue, he said, raising the worst-case scenarios of what could happen if the u.s. were involved in a war. we dont make medicine in this country anymore. we dont make ships. we dont have enough steel and aluminum to fight a battle, right? he said. sunday lutnick stuck to that national security framing, but white house trade adviser peter navarro focused more on the import taxes being leverage in the bigger economic puzzle. the world cheats us. theyve been cheating us for decades, navarro said on nbcs meet the press. he cited practices such as dumping products at unfairly low prices, currency manipulation and barriers to u.s. auto and agricultural products entering foreign markets. navarro insisted the tariffs would yield broader bilateral trade deals to address all those issues. but he also relied on a separate justification when discussing china the illicit drug trade. china has killed over a million people with their fentanyl, he said. speaking before trumps truth social post disputing the notion of exemptions, lutnick alluded to that coming policy. theyre going to have a special focus-type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored, he told abcs this week. the status of negotiations with other nations, including china, remains fuzzy last week with the higher rates set to be collected beginning april 9, administration officials argued that other countries would rush to the negotiating table. ive heard that there are negotiations ongoing and that there are a number of offers, kevin hassett, director of the white house economic council, told abc. he claimed that more than 50 countries were reaching out, though he did not name any. sunday navarro named the united kingdom, the european union, india, japan, south korea, indonesia and israel as among the nations in active negotiations with u.s. trade representative jamieson greer, lutnick and other officials. greer said on cbs that his goal was to get meaningful deals before 90 days - the duration of trumps pause - and i think were going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks. talks with china have not begun, he said. we expect to have a conversation with them, he said, emphasizing it would be between trump and chinese president xi jinping. trump took an aggressive tone himself sunday in his social media post, saying we will not be held hostage by other countries, especially hostile trading nations like china, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the american people. navarro was not as specific about beijing. we have opened up our invitation to them, he said. lutnick characterized the outreach as soft entrees through intermediaries. pressed on whether there is any meaningful back and forth, navarro said, the president has a very good relationship with president xi. then he proceeded to criticize several chinas polices and trade practices. the pitches are different, but confidence is constant last week navarro was bullish even after u.s. and global trading markets suffered trillions of dollars in losses. the first rule, particularly for the smaller investors out there, you cant lose money unless you sell. and, right now, the smart strategy is not to panic, he said on fox news channels sunday morning futures. sunday navarros optimism did not waver despite another net-loss week for securities markets and rocky bond markets. so, this is unfolding exactly like we thought it would in a dominant scenario, he said. others confronted some of the more complex realities of trying to achieve trumps goal of restoring a bygone era of u.s. manufacturing. lutnick suggested the focus is on returning high-tech jobs, while sidestepping questions about lower-skilled manufacturing of goods such as shoes that could mean higher prices because of higher wages for u.s. workers. but some of that high-tech production is what trump has, for now, exempted from the tariffs that he and his advisers frame as leverage for forcing companies to open u.s. facilities. hassett did acknowledge widespread angst. the survey data has been showing that people are anxious about the changes a little bit, he said, before steering his answer to employment rates. the hard data, he said, has been really, really strong.

  Title: Trump announces huge new tariffs to promote US manufacturing, risking inflation and trade wars
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 20:57:51)
  Content: by josh boak associated press washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the new tariffs, coming on what trump has named liberation day, are a bid to boost u.s. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he says are years of unfair trade practices. but by most economists assessments, the move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and upend decades-old alliances. the white house is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble. april 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern american history, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said tuesday. she said the new tariffs would take effect immediately. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. based on the possibility of broad 20 tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. because trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. leavitt is among three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the associated press on first and fifth amendment grounds. the ap says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. the white house says the ap is not following an executive order to refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america. associated press writers mike householder in oldcastle, ontario, sylvie corbet in paris and lisa mascaro contributed to this report.

  Title: Michael Goodwin: Trump bets the White House — and GOP control of Congress — on tariffs
  Source: nypost.com (2025-04-05 20:09:02)
  Content: maybe all that winning was becoming boring. whatever the reasons that led president trump to rock the globe with his liberation day tariff regime, the immediate result has been a world of hurt for millions upon millions of americans. the stock market meltdown that wiped out some 6.4 trillion of value last thursday and friday means many households saw 10 or more of their nest eggs suddenly erased. their pain is matched only by their confusion about why the president triggered the sell-off. after all, trump 2.0 was scoring major successes by sealing the border and deporting alien criminals. the doge audit was proving his claims of massive government waste and fraud. similarly, his crackdown on columbia and other universities that allow hamas supporters to harass and intimidate jewish students is rattling the radicals where it hurts most in their multimillion dollar federal grants. meanwhile, his election provided a big boost to the economy, which has been humming along. because he has been faithful to his campaign promises, polls show trump with the highest approval rating hes ever had. his winning streak is not the only thing in jeopardy. given the tumult on wall street and in markets around the world, its reasonable to conclude that trump is betting his presidency and gop control of congress on the tariff gambit. that probably wasnt his plan, but like it not, thats how its playing out. the early returns are not promising. by 15 percentage points, voters hold a negative view of trumps handling of inflation and most oppose his emphasis on tariffs, a wall street journal poll finds. negative views of his economic stewardship outweigh positive views by 8 points, according to the survey, which was completed before markets tanked last week. public doubts about the economy are dramatic when you recall how important the subject was to trumps victory. his attacks on bidenomics and inflation became a key reason why trump swept the seven swing states and his party carried congress. yet demoralized and divided democrats now smell blood as some voters begin to sour. the disruption caused by the tariff war is so severe that jpmorgan economists predict it could take a big bite out of americas gross domestic product this year and warn that if, the tariffs remain in place, there is a 60 chance of a global recession. federal reserve chairman jerome powell, no fan of trumps to start with, said the tariffs could lead to both higher inflation and slower growth. naturally, the fear gauges are also rising among congressional republicans. texas sen. ted cruz said friday that if the tariff war pushes the us into a recession, particularly a bad recession, 2026 in all likelihood politically would be a bloodbath. you would face a democrat house, and you might even face a democrat senate. none of this is certain, of course, nor is it meant to suggest trumps goal isnt worthy. leveling global trade is admirable and a core tenet of his america first approach. he aims to protect and expand domestic manufacturing and create good, well-paying jobs by giving more companies incentives to move their headquarters and factories to the united states. its been a consistent theme since he entered politics in 2015 with a rousing denunciation of the globalists whose unfair trade practices hollowed out large industries in middle america. and he celebrated his 2024 win by hosting business titans at mar-a-lago who promised to invest in america. among them was japans softbank, whose chief executive pledged to invest 100 billion. thats the point of tariffs to incentivize companies to make their products and create jobs in the us. meanwhile, the taxes on imported products also provide washington with a source of revenue, with the white house predicting as much as 700 billion would be collected this year under the new rates, which would help fund tax cuts. if they are reciprocal, which trump insists he wants, tariffs would even the score by punishing imported goods at the same rate as countries do that impose high taxes on american products sold abroad. a prime example of the current imbalance was noted by white house adviser stephen miller why is that if you go to tokyo, theres no american cars, if you go to berlin, theres no american cars, but on our streets, we have every foreign car there is? he added theyve blocked their markets from our cars. president trump is saying that has to end. although the president has repeatedly denied it, the suspicion that the aim is to get trading partners to negotiate was effectively confirmed by trump himself friday afternoon. just had a very productive call with to lam, general secretary of the communist party of vietnam, who told me that vietnam wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s., he posted on truth social. but the first inkling of good news came just hours after china raised its tax on american products to 34, saying reciprocal levies were necessary to stop trumps bullying. subscribe to our daily post opinion newsletter! please provide a valid email address. by clicking above you agree to the terms of use and . china, of course, has long been the poster child of trade imbalances. a study from the us international trade commission reports that the sheer volume of chinas exports to the us outpaced americas exports to china by three to one in 2024. even a sneering axios concedes the facts, writing that china has a long record of trade abuses ip theft, forced technology transfers, state subsidies and market access restrictions for foreign companies. it continues the european union doesnt cheat the way china does. but it protects its own through generous agricultural subsidies and strict regulatory standards that often double as trade barriers. the vat, europes value added tax that can go as high as 27 in some countries, is another barrier on us imports. thus, with restrictive trade practices by other nations, theres often not much difference between friend and foe. leaving aside the predictable legacy media reaction to the turmoil one suspects there was glee in the new york times newsroom over the markets plunge and trumps political predicament there are also conservative skeptics. most of their doubts center on two elements the enormous size of the tariffs and the decision to unleash them all at once. some suggested that more modest rates and an industry-by-industry approach could be more effective because it would focus on specific countries and products, such as steel and aluminum. what do you think? post a comment. another argument is that onshoring cannot happen overnight. for foreign manufacturers to make a decision to relocate means building a facility in the us, hiring workers and producing goods a process that could take many months if not years. trump doesnt have years. the midterm elections are 19 months away. share your stance. please adhere to our the new pm of canada nailed it, he called for zero tariffs between canada and the us so both can become economic powers. this is part of the plan, drive new negotiations that favor the us economy and consumer. but the media wont ever admit that because of tds. im curious to what the next great t. a week of stock market activity doesnt mean that much, really. trump is trying to fix something that has been broken for years, and any change brings anxiety to people. will it work? we will have to wait and see, and the good news about tariffs is that they can be removed or lowered just as quickl. over the past couple of days i have seen videos of obama, pelosi and schumer talking about the unfair us trade tariff balance, especially with china. not one of them did anything to correct it though as it would hurt them politically. i give trump credit for at least trying to level the field. i do. i agree yes we need to fix the tarriff balance but a little at a time so as to preserve the lives of us citizens especially the elderly

agenda. the president earlier insisted to reporters that the rollout of tariffs on all american trading partners was going very well despite the turmoil on wall street. on friday morning, trump claimed on truth social that chinas 34 percent retaliatory tariff against american goods was a sign they had played it wrong and panicked. it is unclear what he meant by that. he later revealed he was negotiating with vietnam, a major source of u.s. goods, over the tariff rate he set for them and implored federal reserve chairman jerome powell to cut interest rates. after yesterdays historically

  Title: Trump threatens more tariffs on China as global markets shudder over how much pain economy can take
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-10 20:33:10)
  Content: follow live updates on the global markets washington ap undeterred by a panicked stock market, president donald trump threatened additional tariffs on china on monday, raising fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war. trumps threat came after china said it would retaliate against u.s. tariffs he announced last week. if china does not withdraw its 34 increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, april 8th, 2025, the united states will impose additional tariffs on china of 50, effective april 9th, trump wrote on truth social. additionally, all talks with china concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! the u.s. president has shown few signs of backing down on tariffs despite the mounting pressure in the financial markets. his commitment to tariffs could have devastating effects for the global economy, even though trump is banking that it will ultimately pay off with manufacturing jobs. asked monday if he would consider a pause on his widespread tariffs, trump said, were not looking at that. the u.s. president said he was open to negotiations if we can make a really fair deal and a good deal for the united states. trump added that its possible to have both negotiated settlements with other countries and permanent tariffs. even as israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said his country would take its tariffs against u.s. goods to zero, trump was noncommittal about removing the new import taxes placed on an ally. the white house also said monday that trump would veto a senate bill that would mandate congressional approval for new tariffs, a bet that the critical mass of republican lawmakers will loyally back him despite the economic and political risks. however, there are signs of frustration even among trumps allies. sen. john kennedy, a louisiana republican, said he supports the presidents goals of better trade deals but worries about the economic uncertainty. we dont know if the medicine will be worse than the disease, kennedy said, adding, this is president trumps economy now. if trump implements his new taxes on imports from china, u.s. tariffs on chinese goods would reach a combined 104. the new taxes would be on top of the 20 tariffs announced as punishment for fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34 tariffs announced last week. not only could that increase prices for american consumers, it could also give china an incentive to flood other countries with cheaper goods and seek deeper relationships with other trading partners. china responded angrily and said it would not back down. the u.s. threat to escalate tariffs on china is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the u.s., said a statement from the commerce ministry in beijing. china will never accept this. if the u.s. insists on its own way, china will fight to the end. after sell-offs on the prior two days of trading, the dow jones industrial average on monday fell 0.9. the sp 500 slumped 0.2, and the nasdaq composite was up 0.1. trump frequently bragged about stock market gains during his first term, and the threat of losses on wall street was viewed as a potential guardrail on risky economic policies in his second term. but that hasnt been the case, and trump has described days of financial pain as necessary. i dont mind going through it because i see a beautiful picture at the end, he said. trump officials have frequently appeared on television to make the case for his policies, but none of their explanations have calmed the markets. the only improvement came from a false report that top economic adviser kevin hassett said trump was considering a pause on all tariffs except for china. stock prices spiked before the white house denied it was true by calling the post fake news. the republican president has remained defiant despite fears that he could be pushing the u.s. toward a recession, insisting that his tariffs are necessary for rebuilding domestic manufacturing and resetting trade relationships with other countries. but his aggressive push has scrambled u.s. economic policy. even though inflation remains elevated, trump has called on the federal reserve to lower its benchmark interest rates that were increased to constrain price increases. federal reserve chair jerome powell warned friday that the tariffs could increase inflation, and he said, theres a lot of waiting and seeing going on, including by us, before any decisions would be made. european commission president ursula von der leyen said the european union would focus on trade with other countries besides the united states, saying there are vast opportunities elsewhere. trump said he spoke with japanese prime minister shigeru ishiba to start trade negotiations. he complained on truth social they have treated the u.s. very poorly on trade and they dont take our cars, but we take millions of theirs. ishiba said he told trump that hes strongly concerned that tariffs would discourage investment from japan, which has been the worlds biggest investor in the u.s. in the past five years. he described the situation as a national crisis and said his government would negotiate with washington to urge trump to reconsider the tariffs. white house trade adviser peter navarro suggested countries would need to do much more than simply lower their own tariff rates to reach deals, an indication that talks could be a drawn-out process. lets take vietnam, he said on cnbc. when they come to us and say, well go to zero tariffs, that means nothing to us because its the non-tariff cheating that matters. meeting with trump at the white house on monday, netanyahu said his country would remove tariffs and other trade barriers in response to the u.s. placing 17 taxes on imports from israel. israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same, netanyahu told the u.s. president. trump said he appreciated very much what netanyahu had said. but when asked if he would remove the tariffs, trump said maybe not because of the aid that the united states provides to israel. the u.s. had a 7.4 billion trade deficit in goods last year with israel, according to the census bureau. trump has strived for a united front after the chaotic infighting of his first term. however, the economic turbulence has exposed some fractures among his supporters. bill ackman, a hedge fund manager, assailed commerce secretary howard lutnick on sunday as indifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing. on monday, ackman apologized for his criticism claiming that lutnick, previously the head of the financial firm cantor fitzgerald, could benefit from the tariffs because of its bond investments. but the hedge fund manager also reiterated his concerns about trumps tariffs. i am just frustrated watching what i believe to be a major policy error occur after our country and the president have been making huge economic progress that is now at risk due to the tariffs, he wrote on x. billionaire elon musk, a top adviser to trump on overhauling the federal government, expressed skepticism about tariffs over the weekend. musk has said that tariffs would drive up costs for tesla, his electric automaker. i hope it is agreed that both europe and the united states should move ideally in my view to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between europe and north america, musk said in a video conference with italian politicians. navarro later told fox news sunday morning futures that musk doesnt understand the situation. he sells cars, navarro said. thats what he does. he added, hes simply protecting his own interests as any businessperson would do. ___ associated press writers didi tang and stephen groves in washington and mari yamaguchi in tokyo contributed to this report. ___ follow the aps coverage of

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
