  Title: Tariff turmoil: How Tesla and other companies are dealing with the uncertainty of the trade war
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-23 22:23:02)
  Content: new york ap uncertainty over tariffs and an unpredictable trade war is weighing heavily on companies as they report their latest financial results and try to give investors financial forecasts. some tariffs remain in place against key u.s. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. the tariff and trade picture has been shifting for months, sometimes changing drastically on a daily basis. those shifts make it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales. on tuesday, treasury secretary scott bessent said he expects a de-escalation in the trade war between the u.s. and china, but cautioned that talks between the two sides had yet to formally start. heres how several big companies are dealing with the tariff confusion tesla tesla is in a better position than most car companies to deal with tariffs because it makes most of its u.s. cars domestically. but it still sources materials from other nations and will face import taxes. the bigger impact will be seen in the companys energy business. the company said the impact will be outsized because it sources lfp battery cells from china. the broader trade war could also hurt the company as china, the worlds largest electric vehicle market, retaliates against the u.s. tesla was forced earlier this month to stop taking orders from mainland customers for two models, its model s and model x. it makes the model y and model 3 for the chinese market at its factory in shanghai. ceo elon musk, an adviser to president donald trump, on tuesday reiterated that he believes lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity. but he added that ultimately the president decides on what tariffs to impose. akzo nobel the amsterdam-based maker of paints and coatings for industrial and commercial use said the big risk from tariffs could come in the form of lower demand for its products. the company said almost all sales of finished goods in the u.s. were locally produced, with the majority of raw materials locally sourced. over the years, we deliberately localized both our procurement and production in the u.s., said ceo gregoire poux-guillaume, in a conference call with analysts. we also largely run china for china and use the rest of asia instead as an export base. the companys products range from paints and coatings for the automotive industry to the do-it-yourself homeowner. broader tariffs could squeeze consumers and businesses and hurt sales. boston scientific the medical device maker said it expects most of the effecs of tariffs to hit the company during the second half of the year, but that it can absorb the impact. the company raised its earnings and revenue forecasts for the year, despite the tariffs. it estimates a 200 million impact from tariffs in 2025, but said it can offset that through higher sales and reductions in discretionary spending. the company said it has a long-standing supply chain around the globe and has made significant investments in the u.s. boeing boeing said much of its supply chain is in the u.s. and many of its imports from canada and mexico are exempt from tariffs under an existing trade agreement. the company does have suppliers in japan and italy, but it expects to recover those tariff costs. the net annual cost of higher tariffs on the supply chain is less than 500 million. a bigger concern is the potential for retaliatory tariffs, which could impact its ability to deliver aircraft. china, a key target for u.s. tariffs, has retaliated in part by no longer accepting deliveries of boeing aircraft. att att, like its peers in the telecommunications sector, faces higher costs for cellphones and other equipment. the company said it believes it can manage anticipated higher costs, based on the current pause in some tariffs and its supply chain. the magnitude of any increase will depend on a variety of factors, including how much of the tariffs the vendors pass on, the impact that the tariffs have on consumer and business demand, said ceo john stankey, on a conference call with analysts.

  Title: SURVEY: Half Americans Have Given Up On Saving Money...
  Source: studyfinds.org (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights the prevalence of financial insecurity among Americans, influencing public perception and potentially shaping policy priorities. The repeated emphasis on savings shortfalls and reliance on savings for emergencies, "67 of americans feel theyre lagging behind their savings targets. even worse, 47 have completely given up hope," frames the issue as a widespread problem. This can lead to increased public concern and demand for solutions.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Gen Z's relatively high satisfaction with their banks (71%) but also their willingness to switch (45%). This juxtaposition is intriguing because it suggests a potential disconnect between perceived satisfaction and actual loyalty. What specific factors, beyond those mentioned, might be driving Gen Z's willingness to switch banks despite their reported satisfaction? Could this indicate a deeper dissatisfaction with certain aspects of banking services that aren't fully captured by the satisfaction metric?

on average, americans try to save 496 each month, but this number doesnt tell the whole story. three in ten respondents 31 can only put aside 200 or less monthly. this limited capacitypaired with the need to withdraw for unexpected costshas left 25 of participants with smaller savings accounts now than at the start of 2025. generation x seems to be struggling the most, with 31 reporting decreased savingshigher than any other age group. millennials show more stability, with only 19 seeing their savings shrink and 39 maintaining steady balances. gen z displayed the strongest growth potential, with 38 actually building their savings during this period. americans are demonstrating incredible resilience and commitment to saving, even in challenging times, said erin bruehl, vice president of communications at current. the fact that people are actively trying to build emergency funds shows their commitment to financial responsibility. bruehl added, over 60 of people have needed to use their savings this year, highlighting exactly why americans are smart to try and build this financial cushion. their savings are successfully serving their intended purposehelping navigate both unexpected costs and ensuring they can maintain their essential needs. a generational divide the connections between americans and their banks reveal clear age differences in satisfaction and expectations. among gen z, 71 said their bank helps them reach financial goalsa satisfaction rate that drops steadily with age. only 61 of millennials, 51 of gen x, and just 41 of baby boomers shared positive feelings about their banking relationships. despite relatively high satisfaction, 52 of gen z thinks they could get better service elsewherehigher than other generations. three in ten gen zers find their banks benefits outdated, compared to only 11 of baby boomers who feel the same way. these perception gaps affect loyalty across age groups. a substantial 45 of gen z would consider switching banks, while only 21 of baby boomers would think about making such a changesuggesting banks face bigger challenges keeping younger customers who expect more from digital banking features and benefits. americans should select financial institutions that help them reach their goals, bruehl advised. online or mobile-only solutions often offer higher savings rates than traditional banks without monthly or minimum balance fees and provide additional benefits like early paycheck access and fee-free overdraft protection that provide additional cushion when bills are due. these benefits put more money in consumers pockets and can help people achieve their goals faster. the reality of american savings in todays economy the survey reveals americans trapped in a financial bind they know saving matters but face constant obstacles that derail their progress. using savings accounts as emergency funds rather than long-term growth vehicles points to a broader issue where many people struggle to build both emergency reserves and future savings simultaneously. for financial institutions, these findings highlight opportunities to better serve customers by offering relevant benefits, higher interest rates, and tools that help people track progress toward goals even during times when withdrawals are necessary. the challenges reflect broader economic conditions where rising living costs, flat wages in many sectors, and economic uncertainties continue to pressure household finances.

  Title: Spain unveils €11bn plan to reach long-delayed Nato defence spending target
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-22 13:24:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: Spain's increased defense spending, spurred by pressure from NATO and the perceived threat from Russia ('vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security'), aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize their security in an anarchic international system. This action demonstrates a shift towards self-reliance and power balancing within Europe.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Spain's commitment to increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP, but also mentions criticism from coalition partners who describe the plans as 'incoherent and absolutely exorbitant.' This suggests internal political divisions regarding defense priorities and resource allocation. What are the specific concerns of the coalition partners, and how might these internal disagreements affect the implementation and effectiveness of the defense plan?

  Content: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year, saying it has become obvious only europe will know how to protect europe from now on. the country which lags well behind other western nations by dedicating about 1.3 of its gdp to defence spending is one of the nato members that has been pressured by the trump administration to increase its spending, and had previously committed to hitting the 2 threshold by 2029. but speaking on tuesday morning, spains prime minister, pedro sánchez, unveiled a 10.5bn 9bn industrial and technological plan for security and defence that will allow spain to meet the 2 commitment in 2025. sánchez said the plan, which has been approved by his cabinet and will now be submitted to the eu and nato, was needed to address the current and future defence challenges. its main focus will be telecommunications, cybersecurity and buying military equipment. the enemies of europe are not just using missiles as we have seen in ukraine over the past three years, he said. theyre also using unmanned drones and paramilitary forces to sabotage supply chains and to cut gas lines and underwater cables. theyre using social networks to issue disinformation and to polarise people and spread disaffection towards democratic institutions. theyre using ai cyber-attacks and quantum computers to compromise out telecommunications, our supply networks, and our public services in order to target our way of life. the prime minister who pointed out that his administration was finally making good on the 2 commitment pledged by its conservative predecessor in 2014 said the new plan would help reinforce european security in record time. in a world thats dominated by uncertainty, europe is hope and it is certainty and that certainty must be protected by strengthening our security and defence systems because given whats going on, its obvious that only europe will know how to protect europe, he added. and spain will contribute to protecting europe. sánchez said vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security, no matter how far any eu member state was from the frontlines of the conflict in ukraine. the security and stability of ukraine, of eastern europe and the baltic and nordic countries, is also the security and the safety of spain, he said. the people who live in those countries know that putin is serious and that his words are backed by deeds and thats why they look to europe for protection. theyre looking for something important, and that is unity. spain will not be indifferent to that demand. ukraine resists, europe responds and spain fulfils its obligations. sánchez also repeated his assurances that the additional spending would not lead to increased taxes, raids on the welfare state budget, or deficit increases. the plan has faced criticism from coalition partners in the leftwing sumar platform, who described the plans as incoherent and absolutely exorbitant. in january, donald trump increased pressure on nato, claiming the us had shouldered the global defence burden for too long and saying he would ask all nato members to increase defence spending to 5 of gdp. the nato secretary-general, mark rutte, has urged member states to use the threats from washington as an incentive to take unilateral action on raising defence contributions. last month, rutte said the pressure was already paying off in countries such as spain, portugal, belgium and italy. i tell them that, well, now i am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2 by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2 because we have to spend much, much more than 2 but now i am calling you, but you might get a very, erm, patient man from washington on the line if you dont listen to me, he said.

  Content: updated on april 17, 2025 159 pm edt cbs news small business owners worry that mounting economic uncertainty, driven largely by president trumps shifting tariff policies, could shut their doors for good. beth benike, cofounder of busy baby, told cbs moneywatch that a lack of clarity on the direction of u.s. tariffs poses serious problems for the oronoco, minnesota-based retailer. i am a problem solver. when a decision or policy comes out, ill find a solution. i will work with it or around it, said benike, whose company makes nonslip placemats and other products for babies. the next day, the policy changes and that plan doesnt make sense anymore, so i come up with something else. smaller enterprises that rely on imported goods and packaging from china, which now faces u.s. tariffs of as high as 145, are among the most concerned about mr. trumps trade policies. but a prolonged period of economic uncertainty alone can prove fatal, obscuring future borrowing costs, dampening consumer spending, and otherwise hindering the strategic planning and managerial decision-making involved in running a small business. trump administration officials have staunchly defended their economic policies. just as it did during president trumps first term, the administrations america first economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts and the unleashing of american energy will restore american greatness from main street to wall street, white house spokesman kush desai told cbs moneywatch in a statement. recently, however, tremors in the economy intensified by mr. trumps tariffs have eroded the optimism of small businesses, according to a closely watched confidence gauge. the implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months, william dunkelberg, chief economist of the national federation of independent businesses, said in a statement. the decline in optimism comes as mr. trumps economic agenda roils financial markets and raises concerns about slowing u.s. economic growth. consumers are concerned about the inflationary effects of the tariffs hikes. they understand if prices rise, their real spending power will go down, steven j. davis, a stanford university economist who co-developed an economic policy uncertainty index, told cbs moneywatch. also, some of them also feel that maybe their jobs are at risk, so for both reasons many consumers will cut back on discretionary spending. to be sure, even in the best of times business owners can be caught flat-footed by abrupt changes in the competitive landscape. but risks surge when the economic climate become unpredictable. uncertainty is the enemy of entrepreneurship, neri karra sillaman, an entrepreneurship expert at oxford university, told cbs moneywatch. when the rules of the game are constantly shifting one day you have a pause on tariffs, another day you dont have tariffs, if there are interest rate changes or political and economic instability businesses cannot then confidently invest in growth. smaller businesses, which typically have less of a financial cushion than larger enterprises, tend to struggle more in such an environment, she added. davis, whose own index shows a spike in uncertainty in recent months, said trade policy unknowns are the big source of uncertainty right now inhibiting business investment and hiring. when you have tariffs, they tend to introduce cost unpredictability, which makes it very hard to predict and forecast margins accurately, especially in a product-based business, karra added. busy babys benike said the sudden swerves in u.s. trade policy have made planning all but impossible. if i invest time, energy and money and the policy changes again in a way that makes the decision a poor one, i am already invested, the wheels are in motion and id be screwed, she said. i cant make a decision, so the best thing i can do is get the inventory ive paid for here and ready to sell, she added, referring to her latest factory order, now sitting in a chinese warehouse. meanwhile, the new 125 u.s. baseline tariff on chinese imports means that benike would owe 229,000 in duties on products worth roughly 158,000. she has launched a fundraising campaign to help cover the tariff costs. her plan b, should the steep levies remain in place, is to continue manufacturing her products in china and to sell them to markets outside the u.s. there are babies everywhere. if i cant sell in america, there are other countries that are interested, she said. kristin bear, founder of kilo brava, an online lingerie and sleepwear company that sells both directly to consumers as well as to major retailers including macys, nordstrom and anthropologie, said the sky-high u.s. tariffs on chinese imports wipe out our business completely if they stay in place. we have not imported anything yet with the 145 tariffs in place, but it really puts our business in complete jeopardy, she said. another challenge is that u.s. factories arent equipped to manufacture the types of garments she designs, bear said. and because orders for garments intended for sale this fall must be placed with factories by may, its too late to explore manufacturing options in other countries. said bear, noting that she cant afford to lose a whole seasons worth of orders, equivalent to roughly 500,000 in sales if tariffs are still in place when its time to import them, well just have to abandon the goods and close the company. megan cerullo is a new york-based reporter for cbs

street opened on thursday morning after donald trump unveiled his latest wave of tariffs on what the president called liberation day. trumps announcement sent shockwaves through markets around the globe, and shortly after the bell rang at the new york stock exchange, the dow jones industrial average fell 1,150 points or 2.7. the sp 500 dropped more than 3, and the tech-focused nasdaq more than 4.2. the president announced that blanket 10 percent tariffs will be imposed on all nations in a speech at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden shortly after regular trading hours closed in the u.s. about 60 countries deemed the worst offenders including china where a majority of apples devices are manufactured face higher reciprocal levies nearing, in some cases, 50 percent leaving world leaders reeling. the baseline tariffs go into effect on saturday and reciprocal tariffs on wednesday. meanwhile, four republican senators joined every democratic senator in a resolution to oppose trumps tariffs against canada. the senate passed the resolution crafted by kentucky senator rand paul 51-48 on wednesday after trumps announcement. a senate hearing devolved into chaos after sen. ted cruz repeatedly spoke over sen. amy klobuchar as the pair exchanged barbs over nationwide injunctions inhibiting president donald trumps agenda. during wednesdays hearing, the texas lawmaker excoriated federal judges and declared that nationwide injunctions are an abuse of power. cruzs comments come as republicans are attempting to pass a bill to limit judicial rulings against the trump administration. james liddell reports. andrew feinberg and katie hawkinson report from washington, d.c. far-right activist laura loomer met with president donald trump and pressed him to fire several members of the national security council and reports indicate he has taken her advice. trump fired several members of the national security council, including senior directors, after the meeting, axios reports. one u.s. official told the outlet the firings are shaping up to be a bloodbath. the new yorktimes added that at least three senior nsc officials have been fired. this comes after times first reported loomer met with trump, vice president jd vance, national security adviser mike waltz and others in the oval office on wednesday, armed with extensive research she believed worked against several staffers. donald trumps press secretary has claimed that he is partly responsible for a spiritual revival in america and is helping people move closer to god. karoline leavitt, a practicing roman catholic, said that evidence of renewed faith, especially within younger generations, was becoming more visible and that it was a beautiful sight. mike bedigan has the story. an economic analyst says the 50 percent reciprocal trade tariff on lesotho will kill the tiny southern african kingdom that the u.s. president ridiculed last month. spains prime minister has led european leaders in condemning donald trumps sweeping tariffs. pedro sanchez, whose country sells large amounts of car parts, steel and chemicals to the us, described the move to bring in reciprocal tariffs on imported goods from the eu as unintelligent and a return to 19th-century protectionism. steffie banatvala reports. its midday in new york, two and half hours since markets opened on wall street, and initial losses on the major indices appear to have leveled out for now and even recovered slightly from their trading low points. they all remain significantly down from the opening. the dow jones industrial average is now down 1,296 points 3.11 the sp 500 is down 215 points 3.79 and the tech-focused nasdaq has lost 863 points 4.90. canada will impose a 25 tariff on all vehicles imported from the united states that are not compliant with the u.s.-mexico-canada trade deal, prime minister mark carney told a press conference on thursday. carney also said the new tariffs would not apply to auto parts and would not affect vehicle content from mexico. two senior lawmakers on the senate finance committee introduced legislation on thursday aimed at limiting u.s. president donald trumps ability to impose tariffs and requiring congressional approval for new levies within 60 days. republican senator chuck grassley and democrat maria cantwell presented a bill that mandates the president to notify congress about new tariffs, providing an explanation of the rationale along with an analysis of the potential impact on u.s. businesses and consumers. congress must pass a joint resolution of approval for the new tariff within 60 days otherwise, all new tariffs on imports would expire. this bill reasserts congress role over trade policy to ensure rules-based trade policies are transparent, consistent, and benefit the american public, cantwell said. as representatives of the american people, congress has a duty to stop actions that will cause them harm. the bill is based on the war powers resolution of 1973 and aims to reestablish limits on the presidents authority to impose unilateral tariffs without congressional approval. for too long, congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch, grassley said. grassleys home state of iowa relies significantly on farm crop exports, whereas cantwells washington state hosts many export-driven companies like boeing. the senate passed legislation on wednesday that would terminate new tariffs on canada. with reporting from reuters the newsmax team and former trump lawyer and ally rudy giuliani got to ring the opening bell at the new york stock exchange this morning. bit of a shame for them that it was on a day when the presidents

  Title: Are tariffs worth the risk to our retirement — and overall — economic security?

  Content: are tariffs worth the risk to our retirement and overall economic security? in a recent column, i pointed out that president trumps policies are undermining retirement security in three ways disrupting social securitys ability to deliver services reducing 401k asset values and increasing layoffs and prices. setting aside social security, the economic risks mentioned are all related to tariffs. the question is whether it is worth making the economy and the markets tank? tariffs are not typically my area, but i recently had an education from the all in podcast. the episode, which certainly must be the most fun in town, featured smart, rich, pro-trump hosts chamath palihapitiya, jason calacanis and david friedberg on one side and their guests larry summers and ezra klein on the other. they were joined by former all in co-host david sacks, currently on loan to the trump administration as white house a.i. crypto czar. read opinion nervous about the recent bond market volatility? heres how to handle it. it was a no-holds-barred exchange, among really well-informed people who all believe strongly in their views, and no one walked out. the country needs more of that kind of stuff. the area of agreement seems to be that we are too dependent on china for things crucial to our national defense. as kevin hassett, trumps director of the national economic council, put it recently, its hard to attack an adversary hypothetically, say china if they were to invade taiwan with our cannons when we depend on the adversary for our supply of cannon balls. the all in guys were focused on three main areas in this regard 1 we need to control our supply of chips and the environment around artificial intelligence 2 we do not have enough energy for our needs and 3 we are totally dependent on china for critical earth minerals and magnets, which are essential for assembling everything from cars and drones to robots and missiles. read this is americas magic number for retirement and its lower this year although summers and klein may have agreed with these concerns, they were skeptical that moves to date were helpful in achieving these goals and very worried that trumps tariffs would throw the markets into chaos and the economy into recession. i get the national defense stuff and perhaps the need for some strategically placed tariffs. what i dont understand is the they have been ripping us off for decades argument for a worldwide tariff war. if we really have served as the worlds punching bag for the last couple of decades, then we should be bloodied and battered. everybody else should be really rich, and we should be really hurting. read my wife, 66, has a pension, but never paid into social security. does new legislation mean shell now receive benefits? but thats not what the data show. the most recent statistics from the international monetary fund place the u.s. second in terms of gross domestic product gdp per capita among countries with the largest economies switzerland is no. 1. if the sample were not limited to the largest economies, countries like luxembourg would also be ahead of the u.s. the u.s. is 50 richer than canada, twice as rich as italy, and over six times richer than mexico and china. in short, weve won in terms of total stuff per citizen. of course, it matters who gets the stuff. in that we have failed in two dimensions. first, the government did little to ease the transition of communities hard hit by imports. hickory, n.c., like many other u.s. places heavily reliant on labor-intensive manufacturing, experienced significant job losses due to open international trade. the rest of the nation gained by access to inexpensive chinese furniture, and we could have shared those gains with affected communities. second, so much of our stuff goes to millionaires and billionaires, while the real wage of the average male worker has hardly increased at all. such a skewed distribution of income and wealth both prevents half the population from sharing in the nations prosperity and puts political power in the hands of the few. alicia h. munnell is a columnist for marketwatch and senior advisor of the center for retirement research at boston college. she founded the center for retirement research in 1998 and served as its director for more than 20 years. 2025 marketwatch, inc. . please sign in to finish creating your follow alert please sign in to finish creating your follow alert

  Title: Trump’s tariffs may be a blow to Europe and a gift to China
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-02 04:00:27)
  Content: youre reading an excerpt from the worldview newsletter. sign up to get the rest, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox on mondays, wednesdays and fridays. the details of what president donald trump has called liberation day are sketchy, but the impetus is clear. trump has signaled for weeks he wants to impose sizable tariffs on many imports to the united states. at a white house event wednesday, trump may announce a universal tariff on most imports or a sweeping series of reciprocal duties matching the tariffs of other countries. trump and his allies see such measures as necessary to redress perceived imbalances in global trade and also drum up new sources of revenue as the administration radically overhauls the workings of federal government. critics, though, contend that trumps protectionism will amount to a de facto tax on u.s. consumers, and may drive the country into recession even as prices remain high, creating a crisis of stagflation not seen in decades. it may provoke retaliatory tariffs from other nations, including u.s. partners and allies. for the trade skeptics in trumps orbit, the tensions could spur a revival of u.s. industry and manufacturing, as foreign businesses relocate their operations on u.s. soil. but the consensus among economists is damning. trump doesnt seem to understand basic international economics. a lot of the arguments he makes, adam smith was refuting two and a half centuries ago in wealth of nations, greg mankiw, an economics professor at harvard university, told my colleagues. i have not seen a more wrongheaded policy come out of a white house in decades. officials elsewhere fear an unraveling of globalization, supply chain chaos and tanking markets amid the uncertainty. on tuesday, european commission president ursula von der leyen said her continental bloc was prepared to fire back with their own tariffs on u.s. goods and services, even though the endeavor left colleagues utterly disheartened. europe has not started this confrontation, she said. we do not necessarily want to retaliate, but if it is necessary we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. on this episode, the crew breaks down president trumps new economic policy, including tariffs. will trumps new policies mean higher prices for americans? video the washington post the signs of rupture are everywhere. a recent opinion poll in france showed that a majority of the french public would support boycotts of u.s. goods in reaction to the trump administrations bullying of europe. another poll in germany in march found that only 16 percent of germans trusted the united states as an ally. last week, canadas new prime minister mark carney declared that the intertwined, old relationship his country had with the united states was over and explained why he chose britain and france as the first foreign stops of his premiership. its clear the u.s. is no longer a reliable partner, he said. it is possible that with comprehensive negotiations, we could reestablish an element of confidence, but there will be no going backwards. theres a chance that the tariff plan may yield a milder outcome, with trump scaling back some of his threats and hatching deals over tariffs in specific sectors and between specific countries. white house officials have scoffed at economists warnings, arguing that similar downbeat forecasts proved wrong when trump imposed more modest tariffs during his first term, my colleagues noted. but much about the initial months of trumps second term represents a radical departure from the first, and the administrations constant broadsides toward europe via speeches, social media posts and even threats of annexation have convinced many europeans that the transatlantic alliance is about to fall apart. trump is waging economic and political war on u.s. allies and dependants, observed financial times columnist martin wolf. but the resulting collapse in trust of the countries that used to share its values will end up very costly for the u.s., too. in beijing, analysts sense an opportunity. wang yiwei, director of the school of international studies at the renmin university of china, told spanish daily el país that the trump administrations actions caused transatlantic relations to be historically undermined and could lead to a softening in europes stance toward china. the biden administration spent months trying to persuade the europeans to more closely align their approach toward beijing with washington. what western geopolitical solidarity was forged under biden is now quickly evaporating. some say that the 2024 u.s. elections were not a transfer of power as much as a true regime change for the europeans, wang said to the spanish newspaper. da wei, a professor at tsinghua university in beijing, recently suggested to npr that trump was undermining a critical element of american power by alienating the countrys traditional partners and casting doubt over the reliability of washington. the alliances of the u.s. we believe are an important source, probably one of the most important sources of the u.s. strength, he said. in the eyes of the u.s.s closest asian partners in japan and south korea, china remains a competitor and putative threat on multiple fronts. but trumps latest tariff moves including stiff levies on foreign cars saw the three countries hold a strategic economic dialogue for the first time in five years this past weekend, with chinese state media reporting afterward that tokyo, seoul and beijing might even jointly coordinate their response to trumps tariff plan. japanese and south korean officials have distanced themselves from this suggestion. the white house appears unperturbed by the rest of the worlds angst indeed, it seems to enjoy being the proverbial cat among the pigeons. while trump may upend global trade, his administration at home is drastically slashing government, warring with civil society and universities, and flirting with a series of extra-constitutional maneuvers to get its way. to scholars in china, the radicalism of the moment is curiously familiar. what is happening in the u.s. is still far from the cultural revolution. its maybe 1 or 2 percent, da told npr. but you can sense that smell. the populist sentiments common sense is good. so those sophisticated thoughts are something bad. michael froman, president of the council on foreign relations and a former top trade official in the obama administration, argued that the trump era is accelerating the arrival of a world order more shaped in chinas image, with the united states pursuing a form of chinese policy with american characteristics.

  Title: Trump's tariff gambit will raise the stakes for an economy already looking fragile - CNBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-01 18:19:40)
  Content: president donald trump is set wednesday to begin the biggest gamble of his nascent second term, wagering that broad-based tariffs on imports will jumpstart a new era for the u.s. economy. as the president prepares his liberation day announcement, household sentiment is at multi-year lows. consumers worry that the duties will spark another round of painful inflation, and investors are fretting that higher prices will mean lower profits and a tougher slog for the battered stock market. what trump is promising is a new economy not dependent on deficit spending, where canada, mexico, china and europe no longer take advantage of the u.s. consumers desire for ever-cheaper products. the big problem right now is no one outside the administration knows quite how those goals will be achieved, and what will be the price to pay. people always want everything to be done immediately and have to know exactly whats going on, said joseph lavorgna, who served as a senior economic advisor during trumps first term in office. negotiations themselves dont work that way. good things take time. watch trumps tariffs are expected to raise prices. but by how much? for his part, lavorgna, who is now chief economist at smbc nikko securities, is optimistic trump can pull it off, but understands why markets are rattled by the uncertainty of it all. this is a negotiation, and it needs to be judged in the fullness of time, he said. eventually were going to get some details and some clarity, and to me, everything will fit together. but right now, were at that point where its just too soon to know exactly what the implementation is likely to look like. heres what we do know the white house intends to implement reciprocal tariffs against its trading partners. in other words, the u.s. is going to match what other countries charge to import american goods into their countries. most recently, a figure of 20 blanket tariffs has been bandied around, though lavorgna said he expects the number to be around 10, but something like 60 for china. what is likely to emerge, though, will be far more nuanced as trump seeks to reduce a record 131.4 billion u.s. trade deficit. trump professes his ability to make deals, and the saber-rattling of draconian levies on other countries is all part of the strategy to get the best arrangement possible where more goods are manufactured domestically, boosting american jobs and providing a fairer landscape for trade. the consequences, though, could be rough in the near term. on their surface, tariffs are a tax on imports and, theoretically, are inflationary. in practice, though, it doesnt always work that way. during his first term, trump imposed heavy tariffs with nary a sign of longer-term inflation outside of isolated price increases. thats how federal reserve economists generally view tariffs a one-time transitory blip but rarely a generator of fundamental inflation. this time, though, could be different as trump attempts something on a scale not seen since the disastrous smoot-hawley tariffs in 1930 that kicked off a global trade war and would be the worst-case scenario of the presidents ambitions. this could be a major rewiring of the domestic economy and of the global economy, a la thatcher, a la reagan, where you get a more enabled private sector, streamlined government, a fair trading system, mohamed el-erian, the allianz chief economic advisor, said tuesday on cnbc. alternatively, if we get tit-for-tat tariffs, we slip into stagflation, and that stagflation becomes well anchored, and that becomes problematic. the u.s. economy already is showing signs of a stagflationary impulse, perhaps not along the lines of the 1970s and early 80s but nevertheless one where growth is slowing and inflation is proving stickier than expected. goldman sachs has lowered its projection for economic growth this year to barely positive. the firm is citing the the sharp recent deterioration in household and business confidence and second-order impacts of tariffs as administration officials are willing to trade lower growth in the near term for their longer-term trade goals. federal reserve officials last month indicated an expectation of 1.7 gross domestic product growth this year using the same metric, goldman projects gdp to rise at just a 1 rate. in addition, goldman raised its recession risk to 35 this year, though it sees growth holding positive in the most-likely scenario. however, luke tilley, chief economist at wilmington trust, thinks the recession risk is even higher at 40, and not just because of tariff impacts. we were already on the pessimistic side of the spectrum, he said. a lot of that is coming from the fact that we didnt think the consumer was strong enough heading into the year, and we see growth slowing because of the tariffs. tilley also sees the labor market weakening as companies hold off on hiring as well as other decisions such as capital expenditure-type investments in their businesses. that view on business hesitation was backed up tuesday in an institute for supply management survey in which respondents cited the uncertain climate as an obstacle to growth. customers are pausing on new orders as a result of uncertainty regarding tariffs, said a manager in the transportation equipment industry. there is no clear direction from the administration on how they will be implemented, so its harder to project how they will affect business. while tilley thinks the concern over tariffs causing long-term inflation is misplaced smoot-hawley, for instance, actually ended up being deflationary he does see them as a danger to an already-fragile consumer and economy as they could tend to weaken activity further. we think of the tariffs as just being such a weight on growth. it would drive up prices in the initial couple inflation readings, but it would create so much economic weakness that they would end up being net deflationary, he said. theyre a tax hike, theyre contractionary, theyre going to weigh on the economy. join us at the new york stock exchange!uncertain markets?

  Title: Trump announces sweeping new tariffs, baseline tax on imports - Syracuse.com
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-02 21:01:00)
  Content: president donald trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the rose garden at the white house, wednesday, april 2, 2025, in washington. ap photomark schiefelbeinap washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the tariffs follow similar recent announcements of 25 taxes on auto imports levies against china, canada and mexico and expanded trade penalties on steel and aluminum. trump has also imposed tariffs on countries that import oil from venezuela and he plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose have caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy, despite the risk of political backlash as voters in last years election said they wanted trump to combat inflation. senior administration officials, who insisted on anonymity to preview the new tariffs with reporters ahead of trumps speech, said the taxes would raise hundreds of billions of dollars annually in revenues. they said the 10 baseline rate existed to help ensure compliance, while the higher rates were based on the trade deficits run with other nations and then halved to reach the numbers that trump presented in the rose garden. in a follow-up series of questions by the associated press, the white house could not say whether the tariff exemptions on imports worth 800 or less would remain in place, possibly shielding some imports from the new taxes. based on the possibility of broad tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most outside analyses by banks and think tanks see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnating growth. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress . president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. how will trumps tariffs work? how soon until prices might rise?apr. 2, 2025, 854 p.m. trump has blunt words on possible car price hikes amid new tariffsmar. 31, 2025, 956 a.m. because trump had hyped his tariffs without providing specifics until wednesday, he provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. powered by

  Title: Trump finally goes all in on tariffs. Free traders on the right and left are furious
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-03 23:05:03)
  Content: analysis the immediate anger and fallout from trumps tariff plan illustrates how a poor u.s. economy could politically isolate the president, writes john bowden from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. free trade advocates in the republican partys old guard piled on donald trump as the stock market tumbled sharply downwards on thursday in response to the white houses tariff plan. wednesdays announcement of across-the-board tariffs on nearly all countries that export goods to the us sent markets spiraling in after-hours trading, which solidified into a steep drop thursday morning. reuters reported that the first us job losses from import tariff hikes were taking place in michigan and indiana, where automaker stellantis announced hundreds of temporary layoffs due to idling production facilities in mexico and canada. signs of the backlash from within conservative circles were already evident wednesday afternoon, as a handful of gop senators including former majority leader mitch mcconnell sided with democrats to condemn the presidents trade action. make no mistake goods made in america will be more expensive to manufacture and, ultimately, for consumers to purchase, with higher broad-based tariffs, mcconnell said after his vote. center-right media hammered trump on thursday while us allies showed no signs of backing down and instead openly plotted their own tariff measures in response. a trade war appears imminent on the road ahead. assuming the policy sticksand we hope it doesntthe effort amounts to an attempt to remake the u.s. economy and the world trading system, the murdoch-owned wall street journal editorial board wrote thursday morning. if the response is widespread retaliation, the result could be shrinking world trade and slower growth, recession, or worse, the journal continued. there will certainly be higher costs for american consumers and businesses. on the bulwark, host jonathan last sarcastically quipped thursday the woke socialist markets do not seem to appreciate the brilliance of trumps beautiful, very strong tariffs. the white house fired out its own news release highlighting praise from a handful of industry trade groups, as well as republican members of congress. but over wednesday evening and thursday morning the media and economic experts spent the hours picking apart apparent inconsistencies and other confusing aspects of the liberation day announcement. a top target of ridicule for the white houses usual critics were the 10 percent duties levied on the heard and mcdonald islands, a remote pair of islands controlled by australia with no human population and extremely limited fishing activity, according to forbes. virtually zero exports from the penguin-infested rocks reach the us. impressed the crack white house economic team not only found the heard and mcdonald islandsan uninhabited australian territory which is a two week sail from the mainland requiring a permit to visitbut that they managed to figure out the optimal retaliatory tariff to impose on penguins, wrote justin wolfers, a senior fellow at the brookings institution. on consumer news channel cnbc, one reporter could not hide his disdain for the formula used to calculate the reciprocal tariffs put into place by the white house, which according to a number of economists did not appear to actually factor in tariffs put into place by us trade partners. i started calling international trade economic experts, steve liesman said on the network thursday morning. nobody ever heard of this formula. nobody has ever used this formula. so im sorry, but the conclusion seems to be that the president kind of made this up as he went along. he made it up. ian bremmer of the eurasia group, added this is incredibly stupid. yales nonpartisan budget lab was out with increasingly dire predictions for the us economy after the presidents announcement this week. clothing and apparel prices are set to spike by nearly 20 percent nationwide, according to an analysis published wednesday, while the overall economy will shrink and american households in the middle income bracket will be hit with an annual income loss of around 1,700. i expect the fallout to continue into next week, as everyone is trying to assess what the effect will be on final consumer prices, michael tamvakis, a professor and economist with city st. georges university of london, told the independent on thursday. i imagine any good not available in the domestic us market will be affected, especially any food commodities which have to be imported promptly and have a short shelf life, tamvakis predicted. electronics, pharmaceuticals and auto sales would be among the sectors affected immediately, he explained, with higher drug prices in particular having the potential to hurt poorer americans the most. with the trump administration under a self-acknowledged mandate to bring down consumer prices and inflation, the president could be setting republicans up in a very uncomfortable spot come midterm season. the state of the us economy is likely to be very close to the top of voters minds as congressional reelection campaigns begin in earnest next year and later in 2024, for some. high grocery prices and other issues caused by a trade war could easily lead voters to hand the house back to democratic control for the remainder of trumps term, even if the senate remains out of reach. the real danger trump faces could be from dividing the coalition which has now elected him twice traditional republican voters who want to see the us economy grow and thrive, and maga true believers who are willing to see a contraction if it means reorganizing the economy under an america first vision. democrats, of course, are counting on this as their party continues to grapple with a crisis of confidence. voters remain unhappy with congressional democrats, especially senate minority leader chuck schumer, amid the doge-ification of the federal government and the collapse of democratic resistance in the senate, both in the face of the laken riley act and more recent government shutdown fight. schumer, who saw his party shed three seats in the senate last year, maintains that he still has a winning record in terms of both elections and legislating. a tanking us economy could make that pronouncement a reality come next year. if trump doesnt see things turn around for the us economy before the end of the year, he could well end up handing schumer a lifeline right when his rival needs it most. join thought-provoking

  Title: World braces for 'Liberation Day' as Trump set to reveal sweeping tariffs

  Content: markets and foreign capitals have braced themselves for a broad set of tariffs from president trump on wednesday, anxious for details on a dramatic shift in u.s. trade policy that is expected to supercharge the costs of cars, houses and everyday goods for americans. it is unclear whether the trump administration plans to impose a universal, baseline rate for import taxes on trading partners, or to customize tariff policy to each foreign nation, imposing reciprocal rates on a case-by-case basis. it is also unclear whether there will be any exceptions. a white house official told the times that exact details of the plan are still being perfected. the lack of clarity has rattled markets in recent weeks, driving the worst first annual quarter in three years and erasing gains on the standard poors 500 index made since trumps election victory in november. the white house said trump would announce his plans at 1 p.m. pacific time on wednesday, precisely when closing bells ring on wall street. after that, the new policy will be effective immediately, white house press secretary karoline leavitt told reporters at a tuesday news briefing. costs could rise immediately on perishable goods caught in limbo at international ports, including avocados and pineapples, said sung won sohn, a former commissioner at the port of los angeles. prices on larger items with dwindling inventories, such as foreign cars and washing machines, are likely to rise within weeks. lumber is stacked outside at the milan lumber co. in milan, n.h. robert f. bukaty associated press for los angeles, in particular, the tariffs are coming at a very bad time, sohn said. were in kind of bad shape, because you need a lot of lumber to rebuild from the fires, and the construction hasnt started yet. itll probably start in three to four months, and thats exactly when were going to be hit by higher prices for lumber. top european union leaders have alluded to potent retaliation that could extend beyond american whiskey and hit directly at silicon valley, core to the u.s. and californian economy. and californias agricultural economy the nations largest could become a target as well. retaliatory tariffs are expected to come from nations across the world affected by the new rates, risking further response from the trump administration, thus prompting a spiral into a trade war with few winners. leaders in canada, the second largest u.s. trading partner, have said ottawa will react swiftly to any new tariff actions. but mexican president claudia sheinbaum suggested tuesday that her administration will not retaliate immediately if washington slaps new taxes on mexican imports. we dont believe in an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, because that always leads to a bad situation, sheinbaum told journalists at her daily news conference. mexican president claudia sheinbaum addresses supporters at a march 9, 2025, rally at the zocalo, mexico citys main square. eduardo verdugo associated press instead, she called for further negotiations with the u.s., even while acknowledging that she has no plans to speak to trump in the coming days. the dialogue must continue, sheinbaum said. its not a matter of you put that, so ill put that, but rather whats best for mexico. shorter-term pain trumps advisors say the new policy will bring about an overdue correction, returning fair trade practices, ultimately raising significant revenue for the federal government and bringing back manufacturing to u.s. shores. it is, in many ways, the culmination of a years-long campaign by trump to increase tariffs going back to the 1980s, when as a real estate developer and celebrity, he accused japan and china of laughing at and ripping off the united states. in his address to a joint session of congress on march 4, trump complained that countries across the globe place tariffs on u.s.-made goods. on average, the european union, china, brazil, india, mexico, and canada have you heard of them? and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. its very unfair, he said. in his first term, trump negotiated a detailed trade deal, the united states-mexico-canada agreement, that replaced the north american free trade agreement and governed trade practices among the united states and its closest trading partners. susano cordoba sells peanuts to truck drivers lining up in tijuana to cross the border into the united states on march 4, 2025. gregory bull associated press but since resuming office in january, trump has repeatedly threatened new rounds of tariffs on mexican and canadian goods, often retreating from his plans at the last moment. the on-again, off-again threat of tariffs have contributed to the instability jolting stock markets, which closed on tuesday slightly up after a day of volatile trading. allies of the white house have acknowledged that short-term pain can be expected for u.s. households in the wake of the new policy implementation, which trump has referred to as liberation day. theres absolutely going to be short-term pain, republican sen. tim sheehy of montana told cnn on monday. the presidents been clear about that. everyone has. if youre going to remodel your house to make it better in the end, its going to be really annoying in the short term, when your house is getting remodeled and theres drywall dust everywhere and theres workers in your living room, sheehy added. the reality is that remodels got to happen in order to make things stronger and more stable in the back end. already, american consumers have begun to cut back on their spending and boost their savings. a friday report from the bureau of economic analysis , a government agency, showed that the personal savings rate rose 4.6 in february. consumer spending increased just .4, after decreasing by .3 in january. leavitt added tuesday that many countries have been calling the president, asking for relief from the anticipated tariffs. she said the president is open to taking their calls. its simple if you make your product in america, you will pay no tariffs, leavitt said. it is unclear how the administration will measure the success of the new tariffs. leavitt called the stock market, which has experienced volatility in recent weeks over tariff turmoil, a snapshot in time. the white house has repeatedly pointed to companies that have newly invested in the u.s. since trump took office as evidence of tariffs working. a pause on other 25 tariffs against canada and mexico is also set to expire tuesday, and the white house would not confirm whether it would be lifted. trumps announcement comes the same day that 25 tariffs were set to take effect on auto imports at 1201 a.m. wednesday. times staff writer kate linthicum in mexico city contributed to this report.

  Title: Trump announces huge new tariffs to promote US manufacturing, risking inflation and trade wars
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 20:57:51)
  Content: by josh boak associated press washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the new tariffs, coming on what trump has named liberation day, are a bid to boost u.s. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he says are years of unfair trade practices. but by most economists assessments, the move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and upend decades-old alliances. the white house is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble. april 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern american history, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said tuesday. she said the new tariffs would take effect immediately. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. based on the possibility of broad 20 tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. because trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. leavitt is among three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the associated press on first and fifth amendment grounds. the ap says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. the white house says the ap is not following an executive order to refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america.

wall street, the nasdaq broke a record with its largest single-day point drop in the markets 50-year history as investors responded to president donald trumps tariff plan. both the nasdaq and dow jones suffered their worst days since march 2020 amid the covid-19 pandemic. the dow fell 1,679 points, which ranks in the top five for most points lost in a single day. the nasdaq fell 1,050 points for its largest one-day drop. the drop happened as investors got spooked over the potential impact from president donald trumps tariff plan and fears it could spark a global trade war. trump has said the policy is necessary to level the playing field for american manufacturers. however, many economists have warned his plan could have a negative impact on the economy as tariffs are expected to raise prices. despite thursdays historically bad day, some analysts believed it could have been worse. markets may actually be underreacting, especially if these rates turn out to be final, given the potential knock-on effects to global consumption and trade, sean sun, portfolio manager at thornburg investment management, told the associated press. but trump remained confident. the markets are going to boom, the president predicted outside the white house thursday. the country is going to boom. against the backdrop of sliding markets thursday, white house officials defended the new tariffs. today, the world starts taking us seriously. our workforce will finally be treated fairly, commerce secretary howard lutnick said in a statement. hours earlier he told cnn the world should stop exploiting the united states. treasury secretary scott bessent issued a statement the presidents historic actions will level the playing field for american workers and usher in a new age of economic strength. but former treasury secretary under bill clinton, larry h. summers, said he would have left his post if such a plan was unveiled. if any administration of which i was a part had launched an economic policy so totally ungrounded in serious analysis or so dangerous and damaging, i would have resigned in protest, he wrote thursday on x. while announcing his sweeping plan, trump vowed to usher in a golden age for america. but thursdays stock market lacked any of that luster. major companies including restaurant chains, retailers, and tech giants that rely on products from around the globe saw their stocks decline as they brace for supply chain disruptions. starbucks ended the day down 11 percent while chipotle fell nearly 4 percent. shares gap tanked 20 percent and macys dropped almost 14 percent. apple plunged more than 9 percent while amazon dipped nearly the same amount. some automakers also endured a rough day as trumps 25 percent tariff on imported cars took effect. tesla stock dropped almost 6 percent and stellantis, parent company of jeep, chrysler, and dodge, slid nearly 10 percent. stellantis announced thursday it was halting production at its factories in mexico and canada. about 900 u.s. employees are expected to be laid off, the automaker said thursday. meanwhile, investors seemed to have found some solace in comfort foods. french fry producer lamb weston gained 10 percent while general mills, coca-cola and kraft heinz each gained nearly 3 percent. thursdays market plunge didnt seem to ease fears that trumps liberation day could dwindle retirement funds tied to the stock markets. georgia taylor, founder of tailored wealth, told the financial times those near retirement must monitor their pensions closely. withdrawing during market downturns can deplete funds faster, so seeking advice on a flexible withdrawal strategy is crucial. this highlights the growing need for financial planning to make pensions last longer. the effect on the retirement savings will depend on the years a person has left until retirement, maggie switek, senior director on the research team at the milken institute, told the independent. for young adults, with a longer time horizon left until retirement, the effects may be offset by future changes in the market, with the stock markets trending upward over longer periods of time. hedge fund manager bradley wickens predicted thursday was just the beginning of a long road ahead for the fallout of trumps tariff plan. he told the wall street journal the true nature of how negative this is is going to take time to manifest itself during april and may, as it all dawns on everyone that, wow, these tariffs are here for a long time. the final impact of trumps plan is still to be determined as companies and other countries determine their response. european commission president ursula von der leyen called trumps decision a major blow to the global economy, adding we are now preparing for further countermeasures, to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail. canadian prime minister mark carney announced that his country plans to match the u.s.s 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles we take these measures reluctantly. and we take them in ways that is intended and will cause maximum impact in the united states and minimum impact in canada. in the face of tariff

  Title: What are tariffs, how do they work and why is Trump using them? - BBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-04 10:46:51)
  Content: us president donald trump has announced sweeping new tariffs on goods imported from the rest of the world. trump claims that a 10 tariff on all nations and much higher rates of up to 50 on individual countries will boost the us economy and protect jobs. however, there are warnings that prices will rise for us consumers and that the move could harm the world economy. tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries. typically, they are a percentage of a products value. for example, a 25 tariff on a 10 7.59 product would mean an additional 2.50 1.90 charge. companies that bring the foreign goods into the country have to pay the tax to the government. firms can choose to pass on some or all of the cost to customers, or may decide to import fewer foreign goods. trump says tariff is his favourite word and for decades he has argued that the us should use them to boost its economy. he says tariffs will encourage us consumers to buy more american-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and lead to huge levels of investment in the country. trump wants to reduce the gap between the value of goods the us buys from other countries and the value of those it sells to them. he argues that america has been taken advantage of by cheaters and pillaged by foreigners. trump has also made other demands alongside tariffs. the first announced during his current presidential term targeted key us trading partners china, mexico and canada. he said he wanted them to do more to stop migrants and drugs reaching the us. trump said a minimum 10 tariff would apply to all imports to the us from 5 april. the uk, argentina, australia, brazil and saudi arabia are among the countries this applies to. however, many nations will face much higher tariffs, starting on 9 april. these tariffs include 49 on cambodian products, 46 on vietnamese imports and an extra 34 on those from china in addition to 20 tariffs previously announced. goods from the eu will be taxed at 20. white house officials described the higher tariffs - on countries trump called the worst offenders - as reciprocal. reciprocal would mean they were based on what countries already charge the us in the form of existing tariffs, plus non-tariff barriers such as regulations. however, this is not what has happened for all of the countries on the list. instead the tariff rate was calculated on the basis that it would eliminate the uss goods trade deficit with each country. the 2 april tariffs are not the first which trump has announced. he had previously introduced a 10 tariff on chinese goods, which was later doubled to 20. he also announced 25 tariffs on goods from mexico and canada, and a 10 tariff on canadian energy imports, before announcing some exemptions and delays. he has also introduced a 25 tariff on all steel and aluminium imports, and a 25 tariff on all foreign-made cars - with a 25 tariff on car parts due to come in at a later date. many economists expect tariffs to push up prices across a range of imported goods, as firms pass on some or all of their increased costs. the products affected could include everything from beer, whisky and tequila to maple syrup, fuel and avocados. some firms may also decide to import fewer foreign goods - or stop altogether - which could in turn make those which are available more expensive. the price of goods manufactured in the us using imported components may also rise. for example, car parts typically cross the us, mexican and canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled. car prices had already been expected to increase as a result of earlier tariffs. the cost of a car made using parts from mexico and canada alone could rise by 4,000-10,000 3,035 - 7,588 depending on the vehicle, according to analysts at the anderson economic group. the chance of a recession rose to 50 after trumps announcement on new tariffs, according to former international monetary fund chief economist ken rogoff. trump previously refused to rule out the possibility of a recession as a result of his trade policies. us commerce secretary howard lutnick said tariffs were worth it even if they led to an economic downturn. the uk exported around 58bn of goods to the us in 2024, mainly machinery, cars and pharmaceuticals. it was already due to be affected by the earlier tariffs targeting steel, aluminium and car imports. prime minister sir keir starmer said clearly there will be an economic impact from the new 10 tariff. however, he said us-uk trade talks are ongoing, and that he will fight for the best deal for britain. the uk government has so far not announced any taxes on us imports. however, it is drawing up a list of us products it could hit with retaliatory tariffs. economists have warned us tariffs could knock the uks economy off course and make it harder for the government to hit its borrowing rules. eu chief ursula von der leyen warned that the consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe. she said europe was finalising its response package to the steel and aluminium tariffs which had already been announced. china, which is facing tariffs totalling 54, said it will place an additional 34 tariff on us goods from 10 april. canadas prime minister mark carney said it was essential to act with purpose and with force. italys giorgia meloni - a trump ally - said the announcement was wrong but that she would work towards a deal with the us to prevent a trade war. in the republic of ireland, micheál martin said there was no justification for deeply regrettable tariffs which benefitted no-one. australias anthony albanese said this is not the act of a friend. south koreas acting president han duck-soo said the global trade war has become a reality. japan said its 24 levy was extremely regrettable and could violate world trade organization and us-japan agreements. the shuttle with four space tourists aboard was also the first to splash down in the pacific ocean in 50 years. kilmar abergo garcia, who had protected legal status in the us, was deported last month to an el salvadorian prison. the us president, who has vowed to remake the global trade order, dismissed concerns, noting the us jobs market is strong. workers are right to fear for their pensions, but the greater worry is the here and now - the economy they live in. the president has granted the app a second 75-day extension to comply with a law that requires it to either sell its us assets or face a ban. 2025 bbc. . the bbc is not responsible for the content of external sites. read about our approach to external linking.

  Title: Executives, Trade and Labour Associations on Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-03 09:34:17)
  Content: reuters -u.s. president donald trump said on wednesday he would impose a 10 baseline tariff on all imports to the united states and higher duties on some of the countrys biggest trading partners, a move that could escalate a trade war and upend the global economy. here are latest reactions from company executives, trade and labour associations companies on holding weve taken note of the announced tariffs and are constantly monitoring the evolving situation and continuing policy changes. our global value and supply chain are well-positioned. germanys fresenius we . strongly support pharmaceuticals not being included in the reciprocal tariff proposal, as a blanket tariff would potentially risk shortages of essential medicines for american patients. steel group aperam regarding the limited volumes we export from the eu to the u.s., we will explore on a case by case basis the feasibility of relocating some of our production. unfortunately, the current lack of regulatory predictability creates an unfavorable business environment on both sides of the atlantic. stellantis the carmaker said it would temporarily pause production at some of its canadian and mexican assembly plants, such as its windsor assembly plant in canada. antonio baravalle, ceo, lavazza we had already planned to increase local production in the u.s. to 100. we are ready to go . but now there is this other element that is to be investigated, the duties for brasil . if they put a 10 duty on brazil, the duty of 20 is somehow already halved. the coffee maker currently produces around 50 of what it sells in the u.s. locally. ferrari purchase contracts for ferraris have clear and standard clauses allowing the company to adjust prices in case trade conditions change before the vehicles delivery. new tariffs will also apply to ferrari cars ordered months ago but not yet delivered to the u.s., a company spokesperson said. motofumi shitara, ceo, yamaha motor our exports would certainly be impacted. if these tariffs continue long-term, including for vehicles, we will need to respond by raising prices or reducing costs. maersk we generally expect customers to be a bit more cautious about their inventory levels. in the very short term, were likely to see some rush air freight orders in the u.s. ahead of the announced tariffs going into effect. it is also likely we will see an increase in demand for bonded storage as customers will want to hold off clearing goods while they get more certainty. gerresheimer the tariffs primarily affect our exports from our plant in mexico to the u.s. these include injection vials, for example . we will pass these customs duties on to our clients as additional costs. if necessary and if the customs duties are to remain in place in the longer term, we will also be able to relocate capacities. massimo battaini, ceo, prysmian on first reaction, the announcement appears to have a positive impact on local production. the tariffs will be applied to finished products, and therefore removes the risk that u.s. production could have been undercut from abroad. anders vindegg, head of media relations, hydro we are working actively both from norway and in the eu in brussels to inform and to work actively with the organisations and other measures that were a part of to leverage the importance of norwegian aluminium to europe. associations ipc, a global association for electronics manufacturing we welcome president trumps commitment to strengthening american manufacturing, particularly his focus on revitalizing the defense industrial base. tariffs will not achieve this goal.trade is essential to supply-chain resilience, innovation, and cost competitiveness. without it, tariffs risk raising costs for american businesses and further driving production offshore. retail industry leaders association the presidents plan is not a targeted attempt to protect american innovation or national security but will hit every familys budget. these newly announced tariffs and the expected retaliatory tariffs on american businesses risk destabilizing the u.s. economy, undermining the goals of bolstering domestic manufacturing and growth. european retail industry body eurocommerce eurocommerce calls on eu and u.s. administrations to engage in constructive dialogue. if negotiations fail, the eu has a legal basis to respond to unfair trading practices by third countries. with the anti-coercion instrument, the eu has an extensive toolbox which could help address the situation. international apparel federation the u.s. governments announcement of heavy taxes on its trade with the rest of the world is a major shock to our global apparel industry. it unnecessarily creates a new and often irrational reality affecting billions of dollars of investments and the lives of tens of millions of people working in our industry globally. ultimately, someone will have to pay the price. canadian steel association to reduce our dependency, the canadian steel industry urgently requires the adoption of strict border measures that address unfair steel trade in canada and helps to recapture the canadian market for our industry, our workers and our communities. spanish association of olive oil exporters the spanish olive oil sector is seriously disadvantaged by this 20, compared to 10 for other producing countries not belonging to the european union. 98 of olive oil consumed in the united states comes from imports, so these tariffs will result in a higher purchase price that will have to be borne by u.s. consumers. kevin craven, ceo, ads group, on aerospace components we are absolutely not clear whether that exemption from all tariffs on items that are classified as air worthy by regulators continues and whether these tariffs apply or not. so potentially that might make it more painful. eu farming group copa-cogeca the introduction of additional tariffs threatens to disrupt global supply chains, drive up prices, and limit market access for farmers and agri-cooperatives on both sides of the atlantic, with significant economic consequences for the agricultural sector. anthony brun, head of french cognac growers association ugvc one could have feared much higher tariffs, but this risk is not off the table and remains with a potential conflict over bourbon whiskey. we already face tariffs in china, now there are the u.s., and the consequences will be very brutal to wine growers. sigrid de vries, director general, european automobile manufacturers association we urge our leaders to meet urgently so that they can find a solution to any issues preventing free and fair trade between historic allies and allow the eu-us relationship to flourish once again. swiss business group economiesuisse a further escalation of the trade conflict must be prevented. the federal council and swiss economic diplomacy are called upon to quickly find solutions at the negotiating table with the u.s. government. from an economic perspective, there are no comprehensible reasons for u.s. tariffs against switzerland quite the opposite. dirk jandura, head of germanys exporters association bga we will have to pass these tariffs on as price increases, and that will hit turnover in many cases . this is an economic blind alley at whose end lie welfare losses for both sides of the atlantic. reporting by reuters bureax, compiled by mrinalika roy, greta rosen fondahn, linda pasquini and alessandro parodi editing by alan barona, milla nissi and bernadette baum 2025

  Title: Trump Advisers Say 50-Plus Countries Have Reached Out for Tariff Talks With White House
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-06 18:32:26)
  Content: fort lauderdale, fla. ap top administration officials said sunday that more than 50 countries targeted by president donald trumps new tariffs have reached out to begin negotiations over the sweeping import taxes that have sent financial markets reeling, raised fears of a recession and upended the global trading system. the higher rates are set to be collected beginning wednesday, ushering in a new era of economic uncertainty with no clear end in sight. treasury secretary scott bessent said unfair trade practices are not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks. the united states, he said, must see what the countries offer and whether its believable. trump, who spent the weekend in florida playing golf, posted online that we will win. hang tough, it wont be easy. his cabinet members and economic advisers were out in force sunday defending the tariffs and downplaying the consequences for the global economy. there doesnt have to be a recession. who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week? bessent said. what we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity. trumps tariff blitz, announced april 2, fulfilled a key campaign promise as he acted without congress to redraw the rules of global trade. it was a move decades in the making for trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the u.s. he is gambling that voters will be willing to endure higher prices for everyday items to enact his economic vision. countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with china and others retaliating quickly. top white house economic adviser kevin hassett acknowledged that other countries are angry and retaliating, and, he said, by the way, coming to the table. he cited the office of the u.s. trade representative as reporting that more than 50 nations had reached out to the white house to begin talks. adding to the turmoil, the new tariffs are hitting american allies and adversaries alike, including israel, which is facing a 17 tariff. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is set to visit the white house monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion with trump along with the war in gaza and other issues. another american ally, vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs. trump said vietnams leader said in a telephone call that his country wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s. and a key european partner, italian premier giorgia meloni, said she disagreed with trumps move but was ready to deploy all the tools negotiating and economic necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized. commerce secretary howard lutnick made clear there was no postponing tariffs that are days away. the tariffs are coming. of course they, he said, adding that trump needed to reset global trade. but he committed only to having them definitely remain for days and weeks. in congress, where trumps republican party has long championed free trade, the tariff regiment has been met with applause but also significant unease. several republican senators have already signed onto a new bipartisan bill that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to congress. lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. wyomings john barrasso, the no. 2 member of the senates gop leadership, said trump is doing what he has every right to do. but, he acknowledged, there is concern, and theres concern across the country. people are watching the markets. therell be a discussion in the senate, barrasso said of the tariffs. well see which way the discussion goes. trumps government cost-cutting guru, billionaire businessman elon musk, had been relatively silent on trumps tariffs, but said at a weekend event in italy that he would like to see the u.s. and europe move to a zero-tariff situation. the comment from the tesla owner who leads trumps department of government efficiency drew a rebuke from white house trade adviser peter navarro. elon, when he is on his doge lane, is great. but we understand whats going on here. we just have to understand. elon sells cars, navarro said. he added hes simply protecting his own interest as any business person would do. lawrence summers, an economist who was treasury secretary under democratic president bill clinton, said trump and his economic team are sending contradictory messages if they say they are interested in reviving manufacturing while still being open to negotiating with trade partners. if other countries eliminate their tariffs, and the u.s, does, too, he said, its just making a deal, then we dont raise any revenue nor do we get any businesses to relocate to the united states. if its a permanent revenue source and trying to get businesses to relocate to the united states, then were going to have these tariffs permanently. so the president cant have it both ways. bessent was on nbcs meet the press, hassett and summers appeared on abcs this week, lutnick and barrasso were on cbs face the nation and navarro was interviewed on fox news channels sunday morning futures. ______ associated press writers giada zampano in rome and fatima hussein in jupiter, florida, contributed to this report. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: Donald Trump’s Tariff Blitz Is Political Suicide - New York Magazine
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-03 16:06:11)
  Content: save this article to read it later. find this story in your accounts saved for later section. give donald trump some credit he is following through, absolutely, on a campaign promise. while few americans imagined that electing trump again would make elon musk a de facto president, tasked with eviscerating the federal bureaucracy, it was no secret that tariffs would be on the menu if trump returned to the white house. tariffs and trade deficits have been a trump obsession for decades. he could be heard talking them up in the 1980s and 1990s, and he has long romanticized a protectionist economy. and while trumps liberation day tariffs are unnecessarily punitive and ultimately counterproductive in an inflationary environment, not all of them can be dismissed out of hand. it is true that globalization and free-trade agreements crippled onetime industrial powerhouses in the northeast and midwest. the white and black working classes were punished in cities like gary and youngstown and detroit as manufacturers fled the country and cheap, foreign-produced clothing, toys, and automobiles flooded the market. joe bidens industrial policy targeted china for tariffs on electric vehicles and solar panels, and there are plenty of reasons for trump to continue or even stiffen tariffs on our greatest geopolitical rival. it is true, as his treasury secretary, scott bessent, recently said, that the american dream is not merely access to cheap goods. the american worker shouldnt suffer so another export champion overseas can flourish. of course, trump is trump, and there is no subtlety to his latest tariffs and no sense of proportion. trump announced a 10 percent universal tariff on all goods barring certain exemptions imported into the u.s., beginning april 5. goods from china were hit with an enormous tariff rate of 54 percent. japan was taxed at 24 percent, europe at 20 percent, and there are many more reciprocal tariffs, which will take effect on april 9. this morning, a 25 percent tariff on all automobile imports kicked in. canada and mexico, already targeted for tariffs, were not a focus of the so-called liberation day. various analysts rate these tariffs as among the very highest in american history, surpassing the smoot-hawley tariff act of 1930 and rivaling the protectionist regimes of the 1890s. an open question remains how long they will last or if most of them represent yet another trump negotiating tactic. bessent seemed to suggest that the tariffs could be provisional. one of the messages that id like to get out tonight is everybody sit back take a deep breath dont immediately retaliate. lets see where this goes, he said, according to cnn. because if you retaliate, thats how we get escalation. if the tariffs hold, trade wars are coming and life is going to get more expensive, whether american manufacturing glory is restored or not. inflation could increase, and the economy may, in the short term, tip toward a recession. for the market-conscious trump, it will be grim times on wall street, which wrongly gambled that trump wasnt serious about levying heavy tariffs on americas trading partners. investors are bound to get more skittish. the postelection stock-market gains have already been wiped out. this is the real problem for trump. his calling card has always been the economy. as democrats, throughout his first term, fulminated about the state of the republic, trump could point to low inflation, low interest rates, and a strong stock market. during bidens presidency, americans felt nostalgia for the pre-pandemic 2010s, and that was trumps time in the sun. as much as they may have found his conduct disconcerting, voters believed he could be an adequate steward of the economy. individual presidents cant wholly dictate economic conditions, but its inarguable that trump, less radicalized than he is today, did relatively little to destabilize the 2010ss financial environment. tariffs were reasonable, the federal bureaucracy was preserved, and the gop-run congress failed in its politically toxic bid to destroy the affordable care act. surveys already show trump posting poorer numbers on the economy. his strong suit is gone, and its probably not coming back not with tariffs, doge, or attempts to gut medicaid. there is virtually nothing trump is doing in his second term to improve the everyday reality of working-class people. mass layoffs of federal employees merely punish those who had stable jobs and make interacting with crucial bureaucracies like the department of veterans affairs all the more challenging. a stiff tariff wont lower a grocery bill. and if republicans do follow through on their bid to lower the deficit by slashing medicaid, which offers health care to some 70 million americans plenty of them republicans in rural areas the backlash will be severe. the bloom is already off the maga rose. the wisconsin supreme court race was a devastating outcome for the trump-musk wing of the party at this point perhaps its only real wing and an indication of where we are probably headed. democrats and independents are furious and ready to vote against trump-aligned candidates. had elise stefanik not been returned to her district in the north country, theres an outside chance that a special election there could have turned a deep-red seat blue. if trump is serious about bringing back 1930s- or 1890s-style protectionism to america, he should consult a history textbook and find out what happened to the republican governments that instituted the tariffs. neither of them survived, with herbert hoover, in the teeth of the great depression, giving way to franklin d. roosevelt and a democratic majority that wouldnt be broken for a generation. democrats have a long, long way to go to reach their fdr-era heights. but trump, through his chaos, is helping them along plenty. by submitting your email, you agree to our terms and

  Title: Tariffs are another reason why Americans feel so lousy about the economy - NPR
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-03 09:00:00)
  Content: americans are worried about the economy as president trump unveils a new round of tariffs. some people are dialing back on spending as a result. spencer plattgetty imagesgetty images north america hide caption americans are in a funk about the economy and its beginning to take a toll on their spending. as president trump rolls out a new round of tariffs, shoppers are keeping a tight grip on their wallets, setting the stage for a possible economic slowdown. personal spending was weaker than expected in february, according to the commerce department, with lower spending on discretionary services such as restaurant meals. and people across the political spectrum say theyre worried about their personal finances, unemployment and inflation, suggesting the presidents policies on tariffs and government job cuts are partly to blame. a survey by the university of michigan found consumer sentiment fell in march for the third month in a row. i dont see things moving in a positive direction. i really dont, says dan fitch, a nurse who works for the veterans administration in portland, ore. the cost of living has already been elevated for a while. so adding on tariffs i dont see how that positively affects anybody. fitch says he and his family arent traveling as much as they usually do. and hes even stopped paying for haircuts for his 3-year and 7-year-old sons. i bought a pair of clippers and im cutting both my kids hair now. heck, i might start doing my own, too, fitch says. it can get pretty ugly but its worth it for a little more peace of mind where your money is concerned. a billboard in miramar, fla., displays a message reading tariffs are a tax on your grocery bill on march 28, 2025. the canadian government has placed the anti-tariff billboards in numerous american cities. joe raedlegetty imagesgetty images north america hide caption a new cbs news poll finds a majority of americans think the president is focusing too much attention on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices. although inflation has fallen substantially since peaking in 2022, consumer prices are still high and are likely to climb even higher as tariffs take effect. i try to stick to a budget and its been very hard to stick to a budget, says kathy merkler, a research laboratory coordinator in tampa, fla. im paying the same amount of money for fewer bags of groceries. merkler is also concerned about the scientific job market, given the federal cutbacks at the national institutes of health and the centers for disease control and prevention. she and her husband have debated whether its a good time to replace their aging car, a 2015 kia soul. even though its on its second engine and its got at least 225,000 miles on it, its still a good car, merkler says. the 25 tariff trump has ordered on imported cars and car parts is expected to add thousands of dollars to the price of a new car while driving up used car prices as well. consumer spending is the biggest driver of the u.s. economy, and it remained remarkably resilient through the pandemic and the period of high inflation that followed. but now that consumer engine may be sputtering a bit. i think if youre a consumer, youre sitting there and saying, ugh, im not so sure about these tariffs here, says dan north, a senior economist at allianz trade north america. my income is kind of dwindling a little bit. oh, and by the way, i just opened up my credit card bill and theres still items i need to pay off from christmas. im gonna draw my horns in a little bit. the recent gyrations in the stock market also may have rattled peoples nerves, leaving them less eager to spend. the sp 500 index has fallen more than 5 since trump took office in january. the threat of tariffs hasnt been all bad for spending. some shoppers raced to buy big-ticket items in february, before most of the import taxes took effect. spending on durable goods jumped 1.4 during the month. but forecasters say that burst of spending is not likely to last. michigan librarian dawn woodward is cutting back on spending. but she did buy a new television weeks early for her sons birthday, in order to avoid a threatened tariff. courtesy of dawn woodward hide caption dawn woodward, a librarian in michigan, bought her son a new television weeks before his birthday, in an effort to avoid an expected tariff. when it comes to other shopping, though, woodward is trying to cut back. i found that stuff that i thought that i needed oh my gosh, i need this or i need that i didnt actually need most of it, she says. instead of buying stuff, woodward is putting more money aside in a her familys emergency fund. and shes not alone. the share of income that people sock away in savings rose to 4.6 last month its highest level in eight months. its another sign of how wary americans are feeling as president trump doubles down on tariffs.

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
