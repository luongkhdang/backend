  Title: Reams of documents related to L.A. County sex abuse cases never turned over, lawyers say
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:11:23)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article illustrates aspects of the Principal-Agent Problem within the context of public institutions. The county (the principal, representing the public interest) delegates authority to its probation staff (the agents). The text highlights alleged failures of the agents (abuse) and a potential failure of the principal (the county) to adequately oversee, document, and respond to these actions over decades, as evidenced by the discovery dispute and the large settlement payout. This suggests a breakdown in the mechanisms designed to ensure agents act in the best interest of the principal and those they serve.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative around AB 218 and subsequent legislative proposals (like SB 577) reflects elements of Agenda-Setting Theory. The large volume of lawsuits enabled by AB 218 (an event/policy) has forced the issue of institutional liability and financial burden onto the legislative agenda, prompting lawmakers to propose new bills aimed at managing the fallout. The framing by Senator Laird about 'restoring equilibrium' suggests an attempt to shape the public and legislative perception of the problem and the proposed solution.

  Content: thousands of documents that could contain key details about rampant childhood sexual abuse inside a defunct santa clarita detention camp including so-called grooming drawings were left scattered inside the facility and never turned over to the victims attorneys, according to a firm suing l.a. county over the decades-old incidents. as part of the preparation for a looming june trial, attorneys with law firm manly, stewart finaldi had arranged april 15 to visit camp scott, a shuttered l.a. county probation camp where many of their clients say they were sexually abused as children. inside the facility were reams of records that the county should have turned over to the firm more than a year ago through discovery, said attorney courtney thom, whose firm has about 150 civil cases alleging sexual abuse by county probation staff. you can understand my shock when im walking through where my clients got raped as children, and there are documents everywhere, thom said at a monday superior court hearing in downtown los angeles. thom said she discovered thousands of paper grievances, a locked file cabinet labeled personnel files camps a w, and a drawing she believed was signed by thomas jackson a probation deputy accused by at least 20 women of sexually assaulting them at the camp. the drawing, included in a court filing, was of the name tami in big, block orange letters and appeared to be signed by a jackson. t. attorney james sargent, who is representing the county and accompanied thom for the tour last week, called her claims inflammatory and incorrect. they want to air what they deem as dirty laundry, said sargent, who told l.a. superior court judge lawrence riff that the personnel files they discovered had nothing to do with the staff named in the lawsuits. nor did the drawing, he said. tami wilson, a former supervisor at the camp, told him she recalled being given the hand-drawn card by a youth, he wrote in a court filing. the county announced earlier this month they planned to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of alleged sexual abuse inside the countys juvenile facilities and foster homes. the settlement believed to be the largest sex abuse settlement in u.s. history arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to file civil suits against alleged predators and the agencies that employed them. a handful of prominent firms including manly, stewart finaldi declined to participate in the settlement and have ongoing litigation. in the aftermath of ab 218, state legislators have introduced several bills to attempt to make it easier for governments and school districts to deal with the financial fallout from the deluge of suits. one of these bills sb 577 is set for a hearing tuesday. the bills author, state sen. john laird, said the legislation is intended to restore some equilibrium, lessening the financial blow to public agencies while still upholding a victims right to sue. county lawyers claim one reason the state law change has had such a devastating financial toll is because many of the records they need to fight decades-old cases are long gone. attorney john manly argued the claim flew in the face of what his firm saw at camp scott. the county has been telling all of sacramento that they dont have any documents, said manly, who urged the judge to allow his firm to publicize the footage theyd taken of the heaps of documents. we need to be able to share this with legislators. riff agreed with the countys request that the videos from inside camp scott remain confidential for now due to security risks, though he instructed both sides to try to find some common ground on whether certain videos could be made public. though camp scott hasnt been used to house youths for years, sargent wrote in a filing that may soon change. l.a. county superior court judge miguel espinoza ordered the county friday to prepare to shut down los padrinos juvenile hall the countys last remaining juvenile hall, where roughly 270 youths are held due to problems stemming from chronic understaffing. the youth presently in los padrinos will need to go somewhere, and if some wind up at camp scott, the public release of photos and videos could be seriously detrimental, sargent wrote. thom noted that both reporters and television crews have been allowed to broadcast footage taken inside the camp, including a 2001 documentary, camp scott lock-up. the l.a. times has been in there to photograph, said thom. mtv videoed more than we did.

  Title: UN researchers warn that Asian scam operations are spreading across the rest of the world
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-21 15:23:50)
  Content: bangkok ap transnational organized crime groups in east and southeast asia are spreading their lucrative scam operations across the globe in response to increased crackdowns by authorities, according to a u.n. report issued on monday. for several years, scam compounds have proliferated in southeast asia, especially in border areas of cambodia, laos and myanmar, as well as in the philippines, shifting operations from site to site to stay a step ahead of the police. more recently, scam centers that have bilked victims out of billions of dollars through false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes are now being reported operating as far afield as africa and latin america. asian crime syndicates have been expanding operations deeper into remote areas with lax law enforcement that are vulnerable to the influx, according to the report issued by the u.n. office on drugs and crime or unodc. the report is titled inflection point global implications of scam centers, underground banking and illicit online marketplaces in southeast asia. this reflects both a natural expansion as the industry grows and seeks new ways and places to do business, but also a hedging against future risks should disruption continue and intensify in southeast asia, benedikt hofmann, unodcs acting regional representative for southeast asia and the pacific, said in a statement. unodc estimates that hundreds of industrial-scale scam centers generate just under 40 billion in annual profits. the trend to hedge beyond the region has been consistent with continued reports of crackdowns targeting asian-led scam centers that have been found operating in africa, south asia, the middle east and select pacific islands, as well as related money laundering, people trafficking and recruitment services discovered in europe, north america and south america. in africa, nigeria has become a hot spot, with police raids in late 2024 and early 2025 leading to many arrests, including people from east and southeast asia suspected of cryptocurrency and romance scams. zambia and angola have also busted asian-linked cyberfraud operations. in latin america, the report says that its notable that brazil has emerged as one country that has faced a growing set of challenges related to cyber-enabled fraud, online gambling, and related money laundering, with some linkages to criminal groups operating in southeast asia. it also notes that in late 2023 in peru, more than 40 malaysians were rescued after being trafficked by a taiwan-based gang known as the red dragon syndicate that forced them to commit cyber-enabled fraud. the report also points to crackdowns on asian-led scam centers in the middle east and some pacific islands. alarmingly, even as asian-led groups have been expanding the geographical scope of their operations, the involvement of criminal groups from other parts of the world is also growing, the report says. new online markets, money laundering networks, stolen data products, malware, artificial intelligence and deepfake technologies are laying the ground for the rise of crime as a service, the report says. these technological innovations facilitate conducting their businesses online and adapt to crackdowns. the convergence between the acceleration and professionalization of these operations on the one hand and their geographical expansion into new parts of the region and beyond on the other translates into a new intensity in the industry one that governments need to be prepared to respond to, hofmann says.

  Content: annapolis, md. ap maryland lawmakers passed a measure saturday to try to limit future liabilities from claims of sexual abuse at state and private institutions after thousands of people unexpectedly came forward with allegations of abuse, many of them in youth detention centers, putting potentially billions of dollars at stake for the state. the wave of cases targeting the states juvenile justice system resulted after maryland eliminated the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse claims two years ago with the catholic church abuse scandal in mind. the measure, which now goes to gov. wes moore, reduces caps on settlements from 890,000 to 400,000 for cases filed after may 31 for state institutions and from 1.5 million to 700,000 for private institutions. it also changes the 2023 law to only allow each claimant to receive one payment, instead of being able to collect for each incident of abuse. in california on friday, los angeles county officials announced they had reached a 4 billion agreement to settle nearly 7,000 claims of sexual abuse in juvenile facilities since 1959. other private and public entities have been rocked by allegations of wide-ranging abuse and subsequent settlements. the agreement in california, which still needs a county boards approval, far surpasses a 2.6 billion settlement reached in 2022 with boy scouts of america, which recently renamed itself scouting america. that settlement involved more than 80,000 men who said they were molested as children by scouting leaders and others. maryland state sen. will smith, who chairs the senate judicial proceedings committee, said it has been estimated that maryland is facing a potential liability between 3 billion and 4 billion. smith, a democrat, noted that lawmakers approved the 2023 child victims act in response to a long fight to have justice for victims of child sex abuse, where our prior framework barred some of those claims if you were above the age of 38. but what we could never have anticipated was just the sheer volume of cases that ensued, smith said. during debate saturday, lawmakers said about 1,500 cases already have been filed. in addition, another 4,500 cases are known about, lawmakers said, and attorneys for plaintiffs have been in settlement discussions with maryland attorney general anthony browns office. sen. justin ready, a republican who is the senate minority whip, said the state liability could potentially be even higher than the estimate cited by smith. we just spent all session wrestling with a 3 billion deficit, which is a huge deficit, and weve been fighting about that and debating it discussing it just one settlement from this very well could end up being that entire amount, and that is not the end of this, ready said. sen. chris west said he doubted the provision in the bill that would limit someone to only sue for one individual case, rather than for each incident of abuse, would survive a court challenge, based on prior rulings by the maryland supreme court. if the supreme court follows the guidance of prior supreme court decisions, they will hold that our attempt to deny people the right to file cases to recover for multiple occurrences is unconstitutional, because those rights for the past two years have been vested, west, a republican, said. the people have had the right to file those cases. smith told reporters on friday that he believed a settlement is the optimal solution here. were hoping that the attorney general and the plaintiffs can get together and work out a settlement, smith said. maryland lawmakers passed the child victims act in the immediate aftermath of a scathing investigative report by the attorney generals office that revealed widespread abuse within the archdiocese of baltimore. before its passage, victims couldnt sue after they turned 38. the law change prompted the archdiocese to file for bankruptcy to protect its assets. the maryland supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the law in a 4-3 ruling in february. the measure approved saturday also would cap attorneys fees at 20 for cases that settle out of court and 25 for cases resolved in court. the senate voted 36-7 for the bill on saturday, and the house voted 92-40 for the bill a short time later, sending the bill to the governor. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: SafeSport Knew of Allegations Against Former Cop Before Hiring Him as Investigator
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-03 00:49:50)
  Content: people at the u.s. center for safesport knew a former police officer was the subject of an internal investigation at his former job but hired him anyway, according to details released wednesday by sen. chuck grassley, who is looking into the matter. grassley, r-iowa, the chairman of the senate judiciary committee, sent a letter this week to the centers ceo, juriese colon, asking more questions about why the organization hired jason krasley as an investigator even though it had knowledge of his potential legal trouble. you conceded that this was concerning information but hired him nonetheless after being unable to ascertain additional information, grassley wrote to colon, who had revealed that information to the senator in response to his original request in february, which stemmed from reporting by the associated press about krasleys arrests. i find this deeply troubling, grassley wrote. krasley has been charged with multiple sex crimes, including rape, sex trafficking and soliciting prostitution, from episodes that occurred during his time at the allentown, pennsylvania, police department, and before he was hired by the center in 2021. the center, which investigates sex-abuse cases in olympic sports, fired krasley in november, two months after learning of his initial arrest for allegedly stealing money the allentown police vice team had seized in a drug bust. later came krasleys arrest for sex crimes and, in june 2024, an arrest for harassment that was resolved in december. grassleys letter recounts what colon wrote to him that one of krasleys references during the hiring process shared with you that he was the subject of an internal investigation by the allentown police department. the case, the letter said, was based on statements from an alleged victim that the person later recanted. the center provided the ap with its response to grassley, dated march 14, in which colon writes that the case has triggered several changes in the centers vetting process. under the new rules, she wrote, this disclosure would have raised a red flag and prompted additional scrutiny into the alleged conduct that led to the internal investigation. colon outlined enhancements of the centers code of ethics and the addition of an ethics clause employees must adhere to. she said she is now personally interviewing all final candidates for jobs and that the center plans to contract with an outside consultant to review its recruiting and hiring process. she also said the center now checks the national decertification index ndi, which keeps track of discipline related to officer misconduct. the centers letter said krasley handled 124 cases, 15 of which were open when he was terminated. the center said there were no complaints of sexual misconduct while krasley worked there. the ex-cop is free on bail awaiting trial. his attorney has asserted his clients innocence in the sex-crime cases, which date to 2015, most recently calling them meritless and uncorroborated allegations from drug-addled and impaired prostitutes. the center has also hired a third-party firm to reach out to people whose cases were handled by the former cop. that carried potential to retraumatize victims, one of whom, jacqui stevenson, told the ap the centers outreach about a case that had long been resolved triggered a total panic attack. in her letter, colon explained that the two-month delay in firing krasley was because of a concerted effort not to take steps that would compromise the criminal investigation reasoning that did not sway grassley. i imagine you appreciate that impressions regarding safesports judgment in hiring and firing decisions impact impressions of safesports ability to properly investigate and resolve allegations of misconduct in the sports community, grassley wrote. grassley sent a separate letter to the centers chair, april holmes, saying there appears to be a lack of oversight by the board to adequately supervise the ceo . and other officers and directors in their duties to the organization. the senator questioned whether an increase in funding something colon has asked for from its current budget of around 21 million a year would solve its problems, some of which he suggested are rooted in the complex nature of resolving sex-abuse allegations. he said there is concern that safesport is not prioritizing serious sexual and child abuse cases over other cases, which is causing more serious cases to languish without proper investigation. there was criticism of the centers spending, including its 2.4 million in billing for legal services in 2023. also, grassley pointed out 50,000 on dues and subscriptions, 36,000 on bank fees and credit cards and more than 390,000 on travel, all expenses that seem excessive for a non-profit organization and financial decisions that seem counter-productive to the organization. grassley asked holmes to answer a series of questions, including how the board determined salaries for executives, including colon, who made more than 400,000 in 2023, which included a 58,000 bonus. holmes said the board received the letter and would respond by grassleys may 1 deadline. ___ 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

      > Snippet: the lawsuit from the global strategic litigation council and other human right groups was filed before the u.n. committee that monitors the implementation of the convention on the rights of the child
  Content: mexico city ap a group of human rights lawyers is suing costa rica, alleging the central american nation violated the rights of dozens of migrant children by detaining them in a rural camp for nearly two months after they were deported from the u.s. in february. the children, some as young as 2, are part of a group of hundreds of migrants from mostly asian countries afghanistan, china, russia and others who were deported from the u.s. as part of a wider effort by the trump administration to ramp up deportations. many had hoped to seek asylum in the u.s. and expressed fear over returning to their own countries. instead, they were dropped in costa rica and panama, where they dont speak the local language. the countries were originally intended as a kind of deportation layover, but the migrants have now spent 50 days in limbo. critics described it as a way for the u.s. to export its deportation process, while human rights groups have warned that the two countries were turning into a black hole for deportees. in costa rica, around 200 migrants, 81 of them children, were driven out to a rural migrant processing center along the costa rica-panama border and detained in a former factory building. the lawsuit from the global strategic litigation council and other human right groups was filed before the u.n. committee that monitors the implementation of the convention on the rights of the child on thursday night, and alleges that costa rica violated the convention. silvia serna roman, one of the attorneys filing the suit, said the migrants were held in detention without legal status, with no access to educational services or mental health services in their native language. it has fueled concern the long-term impacts that extended detention could have on the children as many parents have reported their children appearing isolated or sad. the kids are in a very crucial part of their development, and they are all fleeing complicated contexts in their countries. and now theyre subjected to detention for different, but long periods of time and inhumane treatment, serna roman said friday. the parents are concerned. serna roman said migrants have had little access to legal counsel. the costa rican government has said migrants could leave the detention facility if they agree to return to their countries of origin or seek asylum in costa rica. but the lawyer said many families fear they would have nowhere to go and potentially end up on the street, so theyve remained in indefinite detention in the facility known as catem. many people are afraid to leave catem because at least it means shelter, means three meals a day, means a roof over their heads, serna roman said. the costa rican government hasnt been upfront about how they plan to further protect these people. the associated press has repeatedly been denied access to the detention facility since the migrants arrived, but when journalists visited the camp in 2023, families were sleeping on cardboard or in tents on the ground where some say liquid from portable toilets leaks with sparse food. costa rican officials have disputed reports by the countrys ombudsmans office that the deportees arrived in costa rica in visible distress and that authorities failed to guarantee proper conditions for arriving deportees. costa rican president rodrigo chaves said in february that in accepting the asian migrants, his country was helping the economically powerful brother to the north. the suit by gslc and local human rights groups is just the latest in a number of legal fights that have popped up surrounding deportees sent to central american countries. the same group of lawyers filed a similar case against panama, which was holding migrants in hotels and in remote camps near the darien gap, where deportees said they were stripped of their phones. sharp criticisms prompted the panamanian government to release the migrants on the streets of panama city last month, leaving many migrants to fend for themselves. most recently, the deportation of groups of venezuelan migrants and an american citizen to el salvador, where they have been held in a high security prison for gangs, with little evidence to support alleged gang affiliations has also fueled legal battles and fierce political fights. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: Opinion: This isn’t immigration enforcement. It’s political theater. - The Salt Lake Tribune

  Content: federal law enforcement under president trump is engaged in dangerous political theater, with high-profile arrests of non-citizen students, workers and parents set up to score political points more than to protect national security. it is not impossible for the united states to have a humane immigration system focused on public safety that provides for the growth of the nation and local communities. ive seen those possibilities through my work in military intelligence, counterterrorism, homeland defense and cyberoperations and as the chief of staff at u.s. immigration customs and enforcement during the biden administration. border security and interior immigration are linked but separate challenges. in towns within the united states, there is an effective way to do interior immigration enforcement and protect our national security without undue emphasis on undocumented immigrants who do not have criminal convictions. right now, the government is burning thousands of federal law enforcement hours on operations that privilege political objectives over public safety, attacking constitutional protections like due process and free speech as they do. if this administration doesnt correct course, it will lock the country into a future of weaker enforcement, lowered trust in public safety officials and greater risk to americans collective safety. this is not the first administration to fail at this task. president barack obama leaned on broken enforcement policies, using deportation as a deterrent while unsuccessfully trying to reform the broader immigration enterprise. president trumps first administration implemented zero-tolerance policies that separated families, sought to end protections for children who arrived in this country as minors, prioritized draconian deterrence measures and relied on emergency public health restrictions, like title 42. the biden white house then continued to use emergency public health restrictions as a crutch to address a problem that needed a much more expansive solution. as each successive administration relied more on executive power to manage the system, congress did not pass structured, long-term immigration reform. but this moment is worse. the new trump white house is finding ever more cruel, even brutal, methods to publicly target some of the most vulnerable people in this country. while americans are distracted by sensational videos of anti-migrant enforcement actions from the trump administration on social media, the real threats grow. the homeland security secretary, kristi noem, recently announced that federal agents arrested roughly 20,000 undocumented people across the country in february. that doesnt mean 20,000 national security threats were removed from the united states. on average, the united states can deport only about 7,000 to 9,000 people monthly by plane, and detention centers were at maximum capacity. so what happened to the 13,000 other migrants who were arrested? the only rational law enforcement step would be to process and then release them. that means law enforcements time, energy and focus were wasted on a political stunt. and real people suffered. every ice agent dispatched to detain a noncriminal farmworker, construction laborer or college student many, if not most, of whom have legal standing to work and study in our communities is an ice agent not investigating fentanyl networks, cyberattacks, human trafficking or transnational gangs. those are the actual bad actors who threaten american safety and sovereignty. last month, the department of homeland security removed a maryland father to el salvador that it had no ground to deport, and despite well-documented threats against his life from local gangs. ice arrested and continues to hold in detention a tufts university student with no criminal record another case that lacks any public safety rationale. these cases send a message that law enforcement is a prop, not a protector. the machinery of federal law enforcement is powerful. thats what makes it so dangerous when misused by political opportunists. ice and u.s. customs and border protection have greater authority than most americans realize. they can detain people without a warrant, conduct searches without probable cause and deport people without criminal charges. these powers demand discipline, not spectacle. they exist to respond urgently to serious threats, prevent cross-border crime and detain individuals who pose risks when time or circumstances dont allow for traditional criminal justice processes. they do not exist to target migrant grandmothers from guatemala, unaccompanied children fleeing gang violence, haitian families seeking asylum from political collapse, palestinian and indian students who attended u.s. universities under lawful visas, or mexican and salvadoran families working and raising u.s. citizen children while trapped in immigration backlogs. over the past two decades, the united states has invested heavily in a sophisticated vetting infrastructure. it can flag threats based on identities, travel histories and behavioral patterns. its built to catch real bad actors before they can do harm. but instead of using its tools to protect children from abuse or disrupt transnational money laundering operations, they are being used to track down individuals with no criminal convictions, people who are providing our nation the benefits of their hope and hard work. when ice and c.b.p. are used in this manner, their mission is compromised. career agents are sidelined. morale drops. recruitment suffers. when communities see federal law enforcement used to punish rather than to protect, they stop cooperating. law enforcement loses tips, and witnesses. local partners hesitate to share information. thats how dangerous actors slip through. the real bad actors are getting smarter and faster. mexican cartels use tunnels and ultralight aircraft to move narcotics. cybercriminals attack hospitals and rural infrastructure. international smuggling operations launder profits through cryptocurrency. that means the best solution for public safety is not mass deportations its giving undocumented immigrants who have been in the united states for a long time the opportunity to come forward, pay a fine and gain legal status. this country needs law enforcement that goes after genuine threats, not just easy targets, and immigration enforcement that reflects who we are a nation built by immigrants and secured by law. law enforcement agents know how to do it. they built the tools. but if the current administration keeps misusing them, the people who intend to harm us will succeed. jason p. houser is a former ice chief of staff, department of homeland security counterterrorism official, afghanistan combat veteran, and u.s. cyber command liaison to israel and europe. this article originally appeared in the new york times. get the latest news by subscribing to our top stories newsletter. enter your email below to receive more stories like these right to your inbox.

  Title: Justice Dept. scales back crypto cases in line with Trump directives
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-08 21:13:46)
  Content: the justice department has directed prosecutors to limit their pursuit of certain cryptocurrency crimes, the latest example of the trump administration pulling back on white-collar criminal enforcement. in a memo sent to staff members monday night, deputy attorney general todd blanche said the department will no longer pursue cases that he described as better left to financial regulatory agencies. instead, prosecutors should focus on investigating people who commit crimes using cryptocurrency, such as defrauding investors, dealing narcotics and enabling human trafficking, blanche said. blanche also announced the disbandment of the national cryptocurrency enforcement team, a group of cryptocurrency, cybercrime and money-laundering experts established in 2022 to address the challenge posed by the criminal misuse of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. the team played a leading role in some of the governments largest investigations of players in the crypto sector. the department of justice is not a digital assets regulator, blanche wrote. the trump administration has taken multiple steps to legitimize and loosen regulation of the relatively nascent cryptocurrency industry, a sector in which the president and his family have expanded their own financial interests within the past year. president donald trump vowed as a candidate to ease restrictions on crypto companies, shoring up his support and donations from tech investors and digital assets executives who said they had been persecuted by biden administration efforts to regulate the market. the biden administration ramped up scrutiny of the industry after a series of collapses that harmed consumers including the implosion of the fraudulent cryptocurrency exchange ftx in 2022, which resulted in the loss of more than 8 billion in customer deposits. at the first-ever white house crypto summit in march co-hosted by the presidents artificial intelligence and crypto czar, tech investor david sacks trump pledged to end the biden administrations war on crypto. since then, the securities and exchange commission has dropped more than a dozen cases against crypto firms. last month, both the federal deposit insurance corp. and the office of the comptroller of the currency pledged to stop evaluating banks based on reputational risk a practice that some venture capitalists have claimed unfairly de-banked founders of cryptocurrency start-ups. meanwhile, the president and first lady melania trump have begun selling meme coins, a speculative venture that some industry insiders see as a conflict of interest. and in september, trump and his sons announced the launch of world liberty financial, a crypto venture. the business plans to sell a stablecoin, even as the white house works with lawmakers to develop legislation that would regulate these forms of cryptocurrencies that are backed by the dollar. in his memo to the justice department, blanche sharply criticized crypto regulatory efforts under president joe bidens attorney general, merrick garland. the prior administration used the justice department to pursue a reckless strategy of regulation by prosecution, blanche wrote, calling that push ill conceived and poorly executed. blanche said the justice department would largely move away from pursuing litigation against crypto companies accused of violating securities, commodities or banking secrecy laws. those statutes were used to secure the convictions of three founders of the cryptocurrency exchange bitmex in 2022. trump has issued pardons to all three. it was in 2022 that the justice department launched the national cryptocurrency enforcement team with a goal of dismantling cryptocurrency exchanges and mixers that were used by criminals to hide the ownership and source of their ill-gotten funds. as he disbanded the team monday, blanche said that rather than target those platforms for the acts of their end users, prosecutors should now prioritize the criminals themselves. officials had already transferred the founding head of the enforcement team national security prosecutor eun young choi to a newly created sanctuary cities division of the justice department in the first days of the trump administration. chois team played a leading role in some of the departments most significant crypto cases, including against the owners of tornado cash a cryptocurrency mixer alleged to have scrambled funds to obscure their true owners and the prosecution of avraham eisenberg, who was convicted last year in a 110 million market-manipulation case in manhattan. its hard to underestimate the importance this task force has had in pursuing some really huge crypto hacks and cases, said yesha yadav, a vanderbilt university law professor who closely follows cryptocurrency and financial markets. without this team in place, yadav said, intelligence regarding potential cryptocurrency crimes could become more diffuse, making it more difficult for the government to pursue incredibly nimble, very opportunistic actors in this space. the eisenberg case was the justice departments first prosecution involving an open-market cryptocurrency manipulation scheme. it was prosecuted with attorneys from the departments market integrity and major frauds unit. blanches memo ordered that unit to cease enforcement of digital currency cases and focus instead on immigration-related crimes and procurement fraud. the case against tornado cash developer roman storm is set for trial later this year. prosecutors have accused storm of knowingly profiting from criminals, including north korean hackers. but storm has drawn support from cryptocurrency advocates who say he is being unfairly targeted for crimes committed by others using the platform he developed. storms attorney, brian klein, said he read blanches memo tuesday as supporting the dismissal of the case. as weve said all along, klein said in an email. it should never have been brought. justin d. weitz, a morgan lewis partner and former justice department lawyer who oversaw cryptocurrency cases, called blanches announcement an abandonment of cases in the digital asset space. what i see them doing here is recentering focus to be about victims and fraud instead of these technical violations, weitz said. the overall goal should have always been how are we protecting consumers who are getting ripped off in this wild west? if doj devotes resources to protect victims of cryptocurrency-related fraud and manipulation, thats going to be a good thing that will make the industry better.

  Title: LA County reaches $4 billion agreement to settle sexual abuse claims at juvenile facilities
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-07 04:34:21)
  Content: jonathan wright, 39, holds up the t-shirt he was given when he first went to maclaren childrens center in el monte as an 8-year-old during a news conference in los angeles, june 9, 2022. ap photochristopher weber, file los angeles ap los angeles county has reached a 4 billion agreement to settle nearly 7,000 claims of sexual abuse in juvenile facilities since 1959, officials said friday. the agreement, which still needs approval from the los angeles county board of supervisors, far surpasses a 2.6 billion settlement reached in 2022 with boy scouts of america that was the largest aggregate sexual abuse settlement in u.s. history at the time. on behalf of the county, i apologize wholeheartedly to everyone who was harmed by these reprehensible acts, fesia davenport, the countys chief executive, said in a statement. the agreement would settle lawsuits filed by thousands of people who alleged they were mistreated and sexually abused in foster care and juvenile detention facilities in los angeles county. the plaintiffs were able to sue because of a california law that took effect in 2020 and suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sex abuse victims to bring cases for three years. many of the claims involved the maclaren childrens center, which was closed in 2003. the facility, which was intended to be a safe space for children awaiting placement in foster homes, opened in 1961 and was overseen by probation officials until it was placed under the countys department of children and family services in 1976. one man said he was sexually abused by a physician at the facility when he was 8 years old, while another said he was assaulted by a male staff member in a bathroom when he was 5. children were routinely placed in solitary confinement, drugged and restrained in chairs at the facility, according to court papers filed by plaintiffs. it is bittersweet for the survivors, because nothing is ever going to take away what was done to them, and how badly their lives were altered and how much they have suffered, said adam slater, one of the plaintiffs attorneys. however, the settlement hopefully gives them some measure of justice and provides them with some measure of closure. other private and public entities have been rocked by allegations of wide-ranging abuse and subsequent settlements. the 2022 settlement by boy scouts of america, which recently renamed itself scouting america, involved more than 80,000 men who said they were molested as children by scouting leaders and others. and last year the archdiocese of los angeles agreed to pay 800 million to victims of clergy sexual abuse, bringing the total payout to more than 1.5 billion. disclosure of the massive tentative payout by los angeles county comes at a time when the nations largest county home to about 10 million residents is facing a tightening bind of financial obligations on its 49 billion annual budget. officials fear hundreds of millions of dollars for public services could vanish in trump administration cutbacks, while the county has seen additional costs from januarys historic wildfires as it also deals with an ongoing homeless crisis. davenport recently said the county is facing a large amount of uncertainty with its budget some agencies are largely funded by federal dollars. the proposed agreement includes creating a countywide hotline for reporting child sexual abuse allegations against employees and developing a system to expedite investigations, officials said. by balancing justice for the victims with a commitment to reform, this resolution ensures both acknowledgment of past wrongs and a pathway to a safer, more accountable future, patrick mcnicholas, one of the plaintiffs attorneys, said in a statement. the countys claims board will consider the proposed settlement monday. if approved, it would be considered by the board of supervisors on april 29. taxin reported from santa ana, california. associated press writer olga r. rodríguez in san francisco contributed.

  Title: SafeSport knew of allegations against former cop before hiring him as investigator

across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. people at the u.s. center for safesport knew a former police officer was the subject of an internal investigation for sex crimes at his former job but hired him anyway, according to details released wednesday by sen. chuck grassley, who is looking into the matter. grassley, r-iowa, the chairman of the senate judiciary committee, sent a letter this week to the centers ceo, juriese colon, asking more questions about why the organization hired jason krasley as an investigator even though it had knowledge of his potential legal trouble. you conceded that this was concerning information but hired him nonetheless after being unable to ascertain additional information, grassley wrote to colon, who had revealed that information to the senator in response to his original request in february, which stemmed from reporting by the associated press about krasleys arrests. i find this deeply troubling, grassley wrote. krasley has been charged with multiple sex crimes, including rape, sex trafficking and soliciting prostitution, from episodes that occurred during his time at the allentown, pennsylvania, police department, and before he was hired by the center in 2021. the center, which investigates sex-abuse cases in olympic sports, fired krasley in november, two months after learning of his initial arrest for allegedly stealing money the allentown police vice team had seized in a drug bust. later came krasleys arrest for sex crimes and, in june 2024, an arrest for harassment that was resolved in december. grassleys letter recounts what colon wrote to him that one of krasleys references during the hiring process shared with you that he was the subject of an internal investigation by the allentown police department. the case, the letter said, was based on statements from an alleged victim that the person later recanted. the center provided the ap with its response to grassley, dated march 14, in which colon writes that the case has triggered several changes in the centers vetting process. under the new rules, she wrote, this disclosure would have raised a red flag and prompted additional scrutiny into the alleged conduct that led to the internal investigation. colon outlined enhancements of the centers code of ethics and the addition of an ethics clause employees must adhere to. she said she is now personally interviewing all final candidates for jobs and that the center plans to contract with an outside consultant to review its recruiting and hiring process. she also said the center now checks the national decertification index ndi, which keeps track of discipline related to officer misconduct. the centers letter said krasley handled 124 cases, including 15 involving minors. he had 15 open cases when he was terminated. the center said there were no complaints of sexual misconduct while krasley worked there. the ex-cop is free on bail awaiting trial. his attorney has asserted his clients innocence in the sex-crime cases, which date to 2015, most recently calling them meritless and uncorroborated allegations from drug-addled and impaired prostitutes. the center has also hired a third-party firm to reach out to people whose cases were handled by the former cop. that carried potential to retraumatize victims, one of whom, jacqui stevenson, told the ap the centers outreach about a case that had long been resolved triggered a total panic attack. in her letter, colon explained that the two-month delay in firing krasley was because of a concerted effort not to take steps that would compromise the criminal investigation reasoning that did not sway grassley. i imagine you appreciate that impressions regarding safesports judgment in hiring and firing decisions impact impressions of safesports ability to properly investigate and resolve allegations of misconduct in the sports community, grassley wrote. grassley sent a separate letter to the centers chair, april holmes, saying there appears to be a lack of oversight by the board to adequately supervise the ceo . and other officers and directors in their duties to the organization. the senator questioned whether an increase in funding something colon has asked for from its current budget of around 21 million a year would solve its problems, some of which he suggested are rooted in the complex nature of resolving sex-abuse allegations. he said there is concern that safesport is not prioritizing serious sexual and child abuse cases over other cases, which is causing more serious cases to languish without proper investigation. there was criticism of the centers spending, including its 2.4 million in billing for legal services in 2023. also, grassley pointed out 50,000 on dues and subscriptions, 36,000 on bank fees and credit cards and more than 390,000 on travel, all expenses that seem excessive for a non-profit organization and financial decisions that seem counter-productive to the organization. grassley asked holmes to answer a series of questions, including how the board determined salaries for executives, including colon, who made more than 400,000 in 2023, which included a 58,000 bonus. ap sports httpsapnews.comhubsports

  Title: Los Angeles County Plans to Pay $4 Billion to Settle Sex Abuse Claims
  Source: www.nytimes.com (2025-04-05 01:02:40)
  Content: los angeles county has agreed to pay a staggering 4 billion to settle sex abuse claims from generations of children in its juvenile detention and foster care systems in what lawyers said would be the largest payout of its kind in u.s. history. the sweeping agreement, announced friday, was the latest in a wave of settlements precipitated by a five-year-old state law that dramatically expanded the number of child sexual abuse lawsuits filed against municipalities and school districts. the settlement is expected to be formally approved over the next two weeks by the los angeles county board of supervisors and the countys claims board, covering more than 6,800 claims of childhood sexual abuse that date as far back as 1959. county officials have warned that the amount of the settlement will likely lead to budget cuts. most of the cases stem from abuse allegations that occurred in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s at probation and foster care facilities, county officials said. a significant number took place at the maclaren childrens center, a county-run childrens shelter that operated for 42 years east of downtown los angeles in the city of el monte. opened in 1961 as a temporary foster home, maclaren permanently closed in 2003 amid lawsuits that claimed severe mistreatment of children. a civil grand jury report at the time found that maclaren managers had allowed convicted burglars and drug traffickers to care for children and had not checked the criminal background of employees for decades. in subsequent lawsuits, former residents said staff members had crawled into their bunks at night and sexually assaulted them, punishing them if they reported the abuses. some said they had been as young as 5 at the time. on behalf of the county, i apologize wholeheartedly to everyone who was harmed by these reprehensible acts, the countys chief executive, fesia davenport, said in a statement on friday. the historic scope of this settlement makes clear that we are committed to helping the survivors recover and rebuild their lives and to making and enforcing the systemic changes needed to keep young people safe. the proposed payout eclipses the 2.4 billion plan to settle lawsuits brought against the boy scouts of america by more than 80,000 plaintiffs. and it far exceeds the 1.5 billion in cumulative payouts made by the archdiocese of los angeles for allegations of abuse of children by clergy and the 1.1 billion paid by the university of southern california to the hundreds of patients who said they had been abused by george tyndall, who was a longtime gynecologist there. the settlement arises from a change in california law that widened both the liability of public institutions for sexual abuse by employees and the window for victims to file lawsuits. assembly bill 218 extended the age limit to 40 for child sexual abuse claims and opened a three-year window for people to sue for charges dating back decades. as that window closed in late 2022, municipalities, school districts and other public institutions in california were slammed by a crush of lawsuits that have since generated multimillion-dollar payouts. in 2023, a 135 million jury verdict in a molestation case involving a middle school teacher in riverside county left one school district with a judgment totaling 121.5 million. last year, the los angeles unified school district agreed to pay 24 million to former students who claimed they were sexually abused in 2006 and 2007 by a teacher at their elementary school. in a january report, the fiscal crisis and management assistance team, which helps california schools manage their finances, estimated that the states public school districts alone are facing some 3 billion in aggregate costs from ab 218 lawsuits and warned that the situation could force some districts into receivership. officials in los angeles county, the states largest, had warned before the settlement that the lawsuits might bankrupt the county, which has a budget of more than 45 billion but is currently grappling not only with the current threat of recession but also the cost of recovery from the devastating los angeles wildfires. on friday, officials said the county would most likely have to make budget cuts, dip into reserves and borrow to pay for the settlement, which will cover most but not all of the claims brought against the county under the new law. they added that the bonds the county is seeking to pay for the costs of the settlement not covered by insurance would require annual payments of hundreds of millions of dollars that will have a significant impact on the countys budget for years to come. patrick mcnicholas, a los angeles lawyer whose firm represented 1,200 of the plaintiffs in the case against the county, said in an interview that the parties had negotiated for more than a year and a half to strike a balance to both compensate the victims and leave the county fiscally solvent. the number of claimants is huge, he said. the county is huge. and we had to balance the goal of restorative justice with the countys ability to pay.

  Title: House Democrats travel to El Salvador to meet Abrego García
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-21 10:00:53)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying the theory of Separation of Powers, the article highlights significant friction between the branches of the U.S. government. The text explicitly notes the Trump administration's actions are under "constitutional scrutiny," that the President is "openly defying a 9-0 supreme court order," and that a judge is considering "contempt proceedings" against the administration for non-compliance with court directives. This suggests a potential challenge to the established checks and balances, where executive action appears to be in tension with judicial authority and legislative oversight attempts (as seen in denied delegation requests), raising questions about the practical limits of each branch's power in this context.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article serves as a case study for Agenda-Setting and Framing theories. Political actors are clearly using the Abrego García case to advance specific narratives. Democrats aim to "keep the spotlight on a wrongly deported man" and "showcase how erratically the trump administration has handled deporting migrants," framing it around due process violations. Conversely, Republicans frame the issue around national security and defending against "violent criminals" and "dangerous gang members," using the case to criticize Democrats. This demonstrates how a single event is strategically framed by opposing political groups to shape public discourse and support for their respective policy positions on immigration.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents conflicting information regarding the evidence used to justify the deportation. It states the "only evidence federal authorities have produced in court" for the MS-13 allegation comes from a specific gang sheet, but immediately adds that a "washington post review... found that attorneys and judges have questioned the integrity of the allegations in that document." This juxtaposition is noteworthy. Significance: This suggests the administration's legal basis for the deportation may be weaker than the public rhetoric implies, potentially prioritizing removal over the robustness of evidence accepted by the courts. Probing Question(s): Why does the administration continue to rely solely on evidence whose integrity has been questioned by legal professionals and judges? Does this reliance indicate a different standard of proof is being applied in these deportation cases compared to other legal proceedings?; Intriguing_angles: A recurring theme is the lack of information and access regarding the deported individuals once they are in El Salvador. The text notes Salvadoran officials "have yet to respond" to requests to meet Abrego García and that the family knows "nothing of mr. abrego garcias whereabouts." Similarly, for Hernández Romero, the Salvadoran government has provided "no response" to inquiries about his status or allowing a wellness check. Significance: This lack of transparency from the receiving country, as described in the article, raises concerns about the welfare and legal status of individuals after they are deported from the U.S., particularly when their cases involve contested legal grounds or asylum claims. Probing Question(s): What mechanisms, if any, exist to ensure the safety and legal rights of individuals deported under contested circumstances once they are outside U.S. jurisdiction? Does the described lack of response from Salvadoran officials suggest potential challenges in international cooperation on these sensitive cases?

  Content: four house democrats arrived in el salvador on monday, marking the latest effort by lawmakers to keep the spotlight on a wrongly deported man as well as president donald trumps aggressive deportation tactics, which have come under constitutional scrutiny. their visit comes on the heels of a meeting last week between sen. chris van hollen d-maryland and kilmar abrego garcía, whose deportation is at the heart of a legal battle testing the trump administrations ability to expel migrants without due process. the administration mistakenly deported abrego garcía last month despite a court order protecting him from being sent back to el salvador. the house democrats reps. robert garcia california, maxwell frost florida, yassamin ansari arizona and maxine dexter oregon decided to keep their travel plans in the hope of keeping the attention on abrego garcías case and to demand his release. were headed there to keep the pressure on the trump administration to do the right thing, to release kilmar, garcia said in an interview before boarding his flight sunday. i think were entering a constitutional crisis here. the president of the united states is openly defying a 9-0 supreme court order people should be alarmed. salvadoran officials have yet to respond to democrats request to meet with abrego garcia at the detention center where he is now detained after initially being sent to the notorious maximum-security terrorism confinement center, known by its spanish acronym cecot. chris newman, the familys lawyer, said at a monday afternoon news conference that the family know nothing of mr. abrego garcias whereabouts since the staged photo-op on thursday with sen. van hollen. we are particularly concerned about kilmars health and hope to receive news about that from the visit. their presence sends a powerful message the fight to bring kilmar home isnt over, said jennifer abrego garcía, kilmars wife. we need congress to keep showing up. the supreme court recently directed the executive branch to facilitate abrego garcías return, but the administration has stated it has no intention of doing so, citing salvadoran president nayib bukeles refusal to help send abrego garcía back. u.s. district judge paula xinis said if the administration does not show evidence of compliance, she could begin contempt proceedings. democrats have kept a spotlight on abrego garcías case to showcase how erratically the trump administration has handled deporting migrants. the trump administration invoked the alien enemies act earlier this year to justify swiftly apprehending and removing noncitizens from the u.s. but the 1798 law has been used only in wartime, though trump argues he can invoke it given what he dubbed the invasion of migrants in recent years. on saturday, the supreme court blocked the administration from invoking the alien enemies act again to deport another group of venezuelan men until further order of this court. last week, garcia and frost asked house oversight chairman james comer r-kentucky to approve a bipartisan congressional delegation, which would provide lawmakers security and investigative resources, but comer denied the request. homeland security committee chairman mark green r-tennessee also denied a request last week by rep. delia c. ramirez d-illinois for the committee to send a delegation to visit cecot, noting that democrats can use their own personal credit cards to fund trips, and contending that it would waste taxpayer dollars visiting and defending a transnational gang member and reported domestic abuser. the house democrats are paying for the trip on their own without relying on taxpayer money. rep. maxine dexter d-oregon said during the news conference that the trump administration is using taxpayer dollars in the united states to break our constitutional laws by deporting people without due process. el salvadors role in permanently detaining migrants from the u.s. has quickly become political, as both house democrats and republicans have traveled there to make a point in the migration battle. trump has touted the operation as a success, noting earlier this month that his administration is investigating whether they can send homegrown criminals to be detained in el salvadors megaprison. several house republicans were able to tour cecot last week, with rep. riley moore r-west virginia posting a photo flashing thumbs up in front of a cell full of shave-headed individuals, writing hes now more determined to support president trumps efforts to secure our homeland. republicans spent last week sharply criticizing democrats for fighting to demand the release of violent criminals, applauding trump for deporting migrants who they say are members of violent gangs, including ms-13, which originated in the united states, and tren de aragua from venezuela. the trump administration alleges abrego garcía was a member of ms-13, though his family and attorneys deny he had any ties. speaker mike johnson r-louisiana posted monday that house democrats have an obsession to bring a violent illegal alien and member of ms-13 back into the united states. could the contrast be more clear? he added. house republicans remain committed to doing everything we can to protect american families and keep dangerous gang members out of our country. the only evidence federal authorities have produced in court to support the allegation that abrego garcia is part of ms-13 comes from the maryland police detectives 2019 gang sheet, and a washington post review of court documents and public records found that attorneys and judges have questioned the integrity of the allegations in that document since it was written. the democrats argue, however, that the trump administrations approach has also unfairly swept up migrants who legally applied for asylum but were denied due process. some prominent conservatives have also criticized the trump administration over the handling of the case, citing the trampling of constitutional rights. the group of lawmakers plan to also check in on andry josé hernández romero, a venezuelan makeup artist who was deported to el salvador after the trump administration falsely identified him as a tren de aragua gang member based on his tattoos. hernández romero fled venezuela in fear of persecution for being gay and legally claimed asylum by using a u.s. government app to schedule appointments at points of entry. the house democrats asked the salvadoran government, through the u.s. ambassador in el salvador, to disclose whether hernández romero is alive or to allow his attorneys to conduct a wellness check. so far, there has been no response. as the daughter of iranian immigrants who fled an authoritarian regime, ansari recounted in an interview growing up hearing countless stories about people being disappeared off of the streets, an attack on personal freedoms and rights. she argued that if lawmakers do not stand up now, then it only opens the door for trump to go after everybody elses rights and our constitution.

  Title: Reams of documents related to L.A. County sex abuse cases never turned over, lawyers say
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:11:23)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article illustrates aspects of the Principal-Agent Problem within the context of public institutions. The county (the principal, representing the public interest) delegates authority to its probation staff (the agents). The text highlights alleged failures of the agents (abuse) and a potential failure of the principal (the county) to adequately oversee, document, and respond to these actions over decades, as evidenced by the discovery dispute and the large settlement payout. This suggests a breakdown in the mechanisms designed to ensure agents act in the best interest of the principal and those they serve.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative around AB 218 and subsequent legislative proposals (like SB 577) reflects elements of Agenda-Setting Theory. The large volume of lawsuits enabled by AB 218 (an event/policy) has forced the issue of institutional liability and financial burden onto the legislative agenda, prompting lawmakers to propose new bills aimed at managing the fallout. The framing by Senator Laird about 'restoring equilibrium' suggests an attempt to shape the public and legislative perception of the problem and the proposed solution.

  Content: thousands of documents that could contain key details about rampant childhood sexual abuse inside a defunct santa clarita detention camp including so-called grooming drawings were left scattered inside the facility and never turned over to the victims attorneys, according to a firm suing l.a. county over the decades-old incidents. as part of the preparation for a looming june trial, attorneys with law firm manly, stewart finaldi had arranged april 15 to visit camp scott, a shuttered l.a. county probation camp where many of their clients say they were sexually abused as children. inside the facility were reams of records that the county should have turned over to the firm more than a year ago through discovery, said attorney courtney thom, whose firm has about 150 civil cases alleging sexual abuse by county probation staff. you can understand my shock when im walking through where my clients got raped as children, and there are documents everywhere, thom said at a monday superior court hearing in downtown los angeles. thom said she discovered thousands of paper grievances, a locked file cabinet labeled personnel files camps a w, and a drawing she believed was signed by thomas jackson a probation deputy accused by at least 20 women of sexually assaulting them at the camp. the drawing, included in a court filing, was of the name tami in big, block orange letters and appeared to be signed by a jackson. t. attorney james sargent, who is representing the county and accompanied thom for the tour last week, called her claims inflammatory and incorrect. they want to air what they deem as dirty laundry, said sargent, who told l.a. superior court judge lawrence riff that the personnel files they discovered had nothing to do with the staff named in the lawsuits. nor did the drawing, he said. tami wilson, a former supervisor at the camp, told him she recalled being given the hand-drawn card by a youth, he wrote in a court filing. the county announced earlier this month they planned to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of alleged sexual abuse inside the countys juvenile facilities and foster homes. the settlement believed to be the largest sex abuse settlement in u.s. history arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to file civil suits against alleged predators and the agencies that employed them. a handful of prominent firms including manly, stewart finaldi declined to participate in the settlement and have ongoing litigation. in the aftermath of ab 218, state legislators have introduced several bills to attempt to make it easier for governments and school districts to deal with the financial fallout from the deluge of suits. one of these bills sb 577 is set for a hearing tuesday. the bills author, state sen. john laird, said the legislation is intended to restore some equilibrium, lessening the financial blow to public agencies while still upholding a victims right to sue. county lawyers claim one reason the state law change has had such a devastating financial toll is because many of the records they need to fight decades-old cases are long gone. attorney john manly argued the claim flew in the face of what his firm saw at camp scott. the county has been telling all of sacramento that they dont have any documents, said manly, who urged the judge to allow his firm to publicize the footage theyd taken of the heaps of documents. we need to be able to share this with legislators. riff agreed with the countys request that the videos from inside camp scott remain confidential for now due to security risks, though he instructed both sides to try to find some common ground on whether certain videos could be made public. though camp scott hasnt been used to house youths for years, sargent wrote in a filing that may soon change. l.a. county superior court judge miguel espinoza ordered the county friday to prepare to shut down los padrinos juvenile hall the countys last remaining juvenile hall, where roughly 270 youths are held due to problems stemming from chronic understaffing. the youth presently in los padrinos will need to go somewhere, and if some wind up at camp scott, the public release of photos and videos could be seriously detrimental, sargent wrote. thom noted that both reporters and television crews have been allowed to broadcast footage taken inside the camp, including a 2001 documentary, camp scott lock-up. the l.a. times has been in there to photograph, said thom. mtv videoed more than we did.

  Title: In unprecedented payout, L.A. County will settle sex abuse claims for $4 billion
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-04 16:30:44)
  Content: a woman who alleges she was sexually assaulted as a child at the now-closed maclaren childrens center. thousands of former foster children have sued, alleging abuse by staff there. los angeles county plans to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of childhood sexual abuse that allegedly occurred inside its juvenile facilities and foster homes, dwarfing the largest sex abuse settlements in u.s. history. the mammoth settlement, which still needs to be approved by both the county claims board and county supervisors, is a billion dollars more than what county officials had anticipated as the worst-case scenario to resolve a flurry of lawsuits and far more than other organizations notorious for allowing unchecked sex abuse have paid victims. the boy scouts of america, by comparison, agreed to pay 2.46 billion. the archdiocese of los angeles has paid out about 1.5 billion for alleged abuse at the hands of catholic priests. victims of usc gynecologist george tyndall got 1.1 billion. michigan state university paid 500 million to victims of team doctor larry nassar. the unprecedented settlement stems from ab 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to sue, even though the statute of limitations had expired. many california counties, which are responsible for the care of children in foster homes and juvenile halls, saw an uptick in lawsuits. for l.a. county, it was a deluge that still hasnt stopped. thousands of men and women came forward to say they had been molested or raped by probation officials decades ago while incarcerated as children in the countys sprawling network of juvenile halls and camps. thousands more alleged sexual abuse at the now-shuttered maclaren childrens center , a county-run home for foster children that plaintiffs attorneys have compared to a house of horrors. a report found that the facility went decades without doing criminal background checks on its staff. taken together, the thousands of lawsuits, most of which involve alleged abuse from the 1980s through the 2000s, paint a picture of a government that failed to intervene as its facilities turned into hunting grounds for predators, who held immense power over the children in their custody. on behalf of the county, i apologize wholeheartedly to everyone who was harmed by these reprehensible acts, said l.a. county chief executive officer fesia davenport in a statement. she said the county has worked in recent years to crack down on sexual abuse of minors. improvements touted by the county include bolstering the vetting of foster parents and probation staffers and winding down the use of group homes like maclaren childrens center. davenport made headlines in 2023 when she estimated in a public budget hearing that the county could be looking at 1.6 billion to 3 billion in liability for the roughly 3,000 sex abuse claims it expected. her estimate was met with shock and a dash of skepticism from seasoned attorneys suing the county, who said it would blow any previous sex abuse payout out of the water. since then, thousands of additional victims have sued, with more coming forward every month. in addition to creating a three-year window for victims, which closed at the end of 2023 , the new state law let plaintiffs sue if they were under the age of 40 or had recently discovered the abuse they suffered as children. the county said the 4-billion settlement covers most but not all of the childhood sexual abuse lawsuits. some attorneys were not willing to participate in the global mediation process, and negotiations are underway with plaintiffs in those cases, according to the county. the settlement does not include any of the 150 cases filed by manly, stewart finaldi, one of the most high-profile sex-abuse law firms negotiating with the county, according to courtney thom, a partner with the firm. resolving those cases could end up costing the county millions more. patrick mcnicholas, whose law firm is representing 1,200 plaintiffs, said he was mindful during settlement discussions to reach for a number that would bring some justice to the thousands of victims without bankrupting the county, which serves as the regions social safety net. he reasoned that the government could stay solvent with a 4-billion payout and yet it was still the largest sex abuse payout he has ever heard of. this is a historic settlement, he said, noting that he couldnt find a larger sex abuse settlement anywhere in the world. it recognizes the horrific harm that has been done. dominique anderson, pictured around age 11, is one of thousands of plaintiffs who have sued over abuse at the countys juvenile faculties. anderson said her probation officers boss molested her in a motel room when she was around 13. dominique anderson the 4-billion payout will be a huge blow to a county already in tumultuous financial waters, thanks to threats of funding cuts from the trump white house and the cost of recovering from the devastating palisades and eaton wildfires. davenport has warned that the county government , which has a roughly 49-billion budget, could face a fiscal crisis unless hiring is frozen. county officials have said the money will come from draining the countys rainy day fund, slashing department budgets and taking out bonds. the county is expected to owe hundreds of millions of dollars in interest on those bonds, which have to be paid off by 2051. the county said it will pay out the settlement money between january 2026 and jan. 30, 2030, providing the billions to independent allocators who will decide how to divvy it up among the roughly 6,800 plaintiffs. there have been few criminal prosecutions of county staffers accused of abuse in the lawsuits. the probation department presented the l.a. county district attorneys office with evidence against two staff members, thomas jackson and altovise abner, in december 2023. the status of those cases was not immediately available.

  Title: UN researchers warn that Asian scam operations are spreading across the rest of the world
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-21 15:23:50)
  Content: bangkok ap transnational organized crime groups in east and southeast asia are spreading their lucrative scam operations across the globe in response to increased crackdowns by authorities, according to a u.n. report issued on monday. for several years, scam compounds have proliferated in southeast asia, especially in border areas of cambodia, laos and myanmar, as well as in the philippines, shifting operations from site to site to stay a step ahead of the police. more recently, scam centers that have bilked victims out of billions of dollars through false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes are now being reported operating as far afield as africa and latin america. asian crime syndicates have been expanding operations deeper into remote areas with lax law enforcement that are vulnerable to the influx, according to the report issued by the u.n. office on drugs and crime or unodc. the report is titled inflection point global implications of scam centers, underground banking and illicit online marketplaces in southeast asia. this reflects both a natural expansion as the industry grows and seeks new ways and places to do business, but also a hedging against future risks should disruption continue and intensify in southeast asia, benedikt hofmann, unodcs acting regional representative for southeast asia and the pacific, said in a statement. unodc estimates that hundreds of industrial-scale scam centers generate just under 40 billion in annual profits. the trend to hedge beyond the region has been consistent with continued reports of crackdowns targeting asian-led scam centers that have been found operating in africa, south asia, the middle east and select pacific islands, as well as related money laundering, people trafficking and recruitment services discovered in europe, north america and south america. in africa, nigeria has become a hot spot, with police raids in late 2024 and early 2025 leading to many arrests, including people from east and southeast asia suspected of cryptocurrency and romance scams. zambia and angola have also busted asian-linked cyberfraud operations. in latin america, the report says that its notable that brazil has emerged as one country that has faced a growing set of challenges related to cyber-enabled fraud, online gambling, and related money laundering, with some linkages to criminal groups operating in southeast asia. it also notes that in late 2023 in peru, more than 40 malaysians were rescued after being trafficked by a taiwan-based gang known as the red dragon syndicate that forced them to commit cyber-enabled fraud. the report also points to crackdowns on asian-led scam centers in the middle east and some pacific islands. alarmingly, even as asian-led groups have been expanding the geographical scope of their operations, the involvement of criminal groups from other parts of the world is also growing, the report says. new online markets, money laundering networks, stolen data products, malware, artificial intelligence and deepfake technologies are laying the ground for the rise of crime as a service, the report says. these technological innovations facilitate conducting their businesses online and adapt to crackdowns. the convergence between the acceleration and professionalization of these operations on the one hand and their geographical expansion into new parts of the region and beyond on the other translates into a new intensity in the industry one that governments need to be prepared to respond to, hofmann says.

  Title: In Kilmar Abrego Garcia Case, Trump Administration Escalates Its War on Due Process - Immigration Impact
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-16 21:18:32)
  Content: posted by aaron reichlin-melnick apr 16, 2025 abuses, due process the courts, enforcement less than a week after the u.s. supreme court ruled that the trump administration must facilitate the release from custody in el salvador of wrongfully-deported maryland father kilmar abrego garcia, the trump administration has doubled down on defiance, with administration lawyers telling a federal court that mr. abrego garcia is detained in the custody of el salvador and white house officials accusing anyone who supports his return of supporting terrorism. on april 15, with the trump administration stonewalling and refusing to reveal any information about steps it was taking to facilitate his return, federal judge paula xinis in maryland ordered the trump administration to begin disclosing information about the deal with el salvador and how it is that mr. abrego garcia ended up detained there. she will require the government to answer questions submitted by his lawyer, and ordered the deposition of three witnesses that the government has claimed have personal knowledge of the situation. all of this will proceed at a break-neck pace for a federal court, with expedited discovery carried out over the course of the next two weeks. judge xinis decision to require discovery may force the government to finally disclose details of the agreement with salvadoran president bukele, who on april 14 visited the white house and expressed indignation at the very idea that he would ever release mr. abrego garcia from custody. in one exchange, he disingenuously suggested that hed have to smuggle mr. abrego garcia back to the united states. but what president bukele did not answer was the fundamental question of whether the government is holding mr. abrego garcia pursuant to a deal with the united states, as has been suggested. expedited discovery may produce some answers to this. however, if the conclusion is that president bukele maintains full custody over mr. abrego garcia even though he hasnt committed any crimes in el salvador, it remains unclear what a federal court could do in response. given that situation, the trump administration is seeking to win the war on public opinion by reframing its clear error and dismissal of due process into a referendum on mr. abrego garcia himself. despite the fact that he has never been charged with any crime in the united states, the trump administration has been painting him as a major criminal whose very presence in the united states would be a danger. the attacks on mr. abrego garcia began with vice president j.d. vance, who first called him a convicted gang member days after the story broke. it has since escalated, with white house press secretary karoline leavitt accusing him of being a human trafficker, department of homeland security secretary kristi noem calling him a violent criminal, and dhs spokesperson tricia mclaughlin accusing him of being arrested with cash and drugs. crucially, when reporters have pressed the administration to provide any evidence of these claims, they have so far completely refused to do so. the trump administrations escalating war on mr. abrego garcia runs headlong into the facts. so, heres what we know about those allegations of gang membership. in march 2019, mr. abrego garcia was standing outside a home depot in hyattsville, md alongside several other men seeking day labor, when local police came by and arrested everyone there for loitering. a prince georges county police detective interviewed him for four hours and grilled him about possible connections to gangs, which he repeatedly denied. after the interview concluded, the police declined to bring charges and transferred mr. abrego to ice officers who had come to take him into custody for being undocumentedwhich is a civil violation and not a crime. in april 2019, at his initial removal hearing, mr. abrego learned for the first time that the prince georges police department had accused him of being a gang member. the police detective who interviewed him had completed a gang field interview sheet gfis which contained two allegations connecting him to ms-13. the first was that he was wearing a chicago bulls shirt and hat when arrested, which the detective claimed was consistent with ms-13 membership. the second allegation was that a confidential informant had supposedly pointed a finger at mr. abrego and accused him of being a ranking member of the westerns clique of ms-13 even though that group operated out of long island and mr. abrego had never lived anywhere in the u.s. other than maryland. when mr. abregos lawyers in 2019 went to interview the detective and find out more about this supposed informant, they were unable to talk with him because they were told he was suspended. what they couldnt know at the time was that he had been suspended less than two weeks after making the accusation against mr. abrego for the crime of trading police secrets to a sex worker in exchange for sex. the detective wasnt publicly indicted until june 2020, after mr. abregos case had already concluded. at his bond hearing, ice submitted that gfis document as evidence of his membership in ms-13 and nothing else. the immigration judge, despite viewing the documents claims about gang clothing with skepticism, concluded that the discussion of a confidential informant was sufficient evidence of membership in ms-13 to deny mr. abrego garcia bond. the board of immigration appeals later declined to overturn that ruling on a clear error standard. there is no indication that any other evidence of gang membership has ever been presented by any government official in the years since then only the gang field interview worksheet filled out by the disgraced detective. and its that very document, and the judges ruling on it six years ago, that remains the only evidence the trump administration has suggested it will ever provide. the details of mr. abrego garcias case are important, but so too is the broader principle. the trump administrations deal with bukele offers them a convenient way to get around due process. simply deport someone there and transfer custody to a willing ally, no matter how unlawful that deportation was, and then claim that courts are powerless to stop them. this is a dangerous moment for the united states. if trump and bukele can work together to disappear people into one of the worlds most notorious prisons and judges are powerless to stop them, then every person in the country is at risk. this concern is especially heightened as trump continues to flirt with the idea of sending u.s. citizens to el salvador to be imprisoned. as it stands, mr. abrego garcia finds himself trapped in a notorious prison not because of any crime he committed or punishment leveled by a judge, but because it would be politically inconvenient for the united states to own up to its error and make it right. and thats a situation that should make any american who believes in the rule of law and due process furious. to reverse this egregious injustice, its going to take both the federal judiciary and the american public standing up to a bully.

  Title: Costa Rican bigwig tours El Salvador’s ‘mega prison’ for solution to out-of-control migrant gang war
  Source: nypost.com (2025-04-06 16:59:39)
  Content: costa ricas top law enforcement official toured el salvadors notorious mega prison in a desperate search for answers to the bloody migrant gang war that has seen murder rates spike in his country. justice minister gerald campos visited the controversial cecot max lockup on friday looking for ways to fight back as the costa rican homicide rate reaches unprecedented levels, the tico times reported. we are going to take all the good practices and see how we can bring them to a good conclusion in our legal system, campos told the outlet during the tour. we need to build new prisons in line with the level of crime our countries are experiencing today. cecot, a spanish acronym for el salvadors terrorism confinement center, opened in 2023 as a last resort effort to combat that countrys migrant gang problem and has proven successful despite worldwide criticism from human rights advocates. the prison, which is in tecoluca, about 46 miles from the central american countrys capital of san salvador, can hold up to 40,000 hard-core gangbangers in eight heavily guarded buildings, each with 32 cells that will hold about 100 prisoners each. each cell has only two sinks and two toilets. inmates, including tattooed tren de aragua and ms-13 gang members, are forced to strip down and bow shoulder to shoulder under the watch of no-nonsense prison guards. last week, homeland security security kristi noem released a message from inside the notorious prison in an effort to send a message to violent migrant gang members being rounded up in the us. people need to see that image, noem told fox news. they need to see that the united states is going to use every tool that we have to make our communities safer, that that is a consequence of someone who is a terrorist. since taking office in january, president trump has used the 18th-century alien enemies act to deport gang members to the hellhole salvadoran prison without trial, sparking complaints from critics. however, authorities in costa rica are desperate for an answer to their own migrant violence, which has seen the homicide rate spike to 17.2 per 100,000 people last year an all-time high. the bodies are piling up so quickly that the recent autopsy of former yankee brett gardners teen son was delayed because costa rican coroners were backed up on cases. although the number is lower than some american cities, its a shocking development in a country once considered among the safest in all of latin america.

  Title: LA County Reaches $4 Billion Agreement to Settle Sexual Abuse Claims at Juvenile Facilities

  Content: los angeles ap los angeles county has reached a 4 billion agreement to settle nearly 7,000 claims of sexual abuse in juvenile facilities since 1959, officials said friday. the agreement, which still needs approval from the los angeles county board of supervisors, far surpasses a 2.6 billion settlement reached in 2022 with boy scouts of america that was the largest aggregate sexual abuse settlement in u.s. history at the time. on behalf of the county, i apologize wholeheartedly to everyone who was harmed by these reprehensible acts, fesia davenport, the countys chief executive, said in a statement. the agreement would settle lawsuits filed by thousands of people who alleged they were mistreated and sexually abused in foster care and juvenile detention facilities in los angeles county. the plaintiffs were able to sue because of a california law that took effect in 2020 and suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sex abuse victims to bring cases for three years. many of the claims involved the maclaren childrens center, which was closed in 2003. the facility, which was intended to be a safe space for children awaiting placement in foster homes, opened in 1961 and was overseen by probation officials until it was placed under the countys department of children and family services in 1976. one man said he was sexually abused by a physician at the facility when he was 8 years old, while another said he was assaulted by a male staff member in a bathroom when he was 5. children were routinely placed in solitary confinement, drugged and restrained in chairs at the facility, according to court papers filed by plaintiffs. it is bittersweet for the survivors, because nothing is ever going to take away what was done to them, and how badly their lives were altered and how much they have suffered, said adam slater, one of the plaintiffs attorneys. however, the settlement hopefully gives them some measure of justice and provides them with some measure of closure. other private and public entities have been rocked by allegations of wide-ranging abuse and subsequent settlements. the 2022 settlement by boy scouts of america, which recently renamed itself scouting america, involved more than 80,000 men who said they were molested as children by scouting leaders and others. and last year the archdiocese of los angeles agreed to pay 800 million to victims of clergy sexual abuse, bringing the total payout to more than 1.5 billion. disclosure of the massive tentative payout by los angeles county comes at a time when the nations largest county home to about 10 million residents is facing a tightening bind of financial obligations on its 49 billion annual budget. officials fear hundreds of millions of dollars for public services could vanish in trump administration cutbacks, while the county has seen additional costs from januarys historic wildfires as it also deals with an ongoing homeless crisis. davenport recently said the county is facing a large amount of uncertainty with its budget some agencies are largely funded by federal dollars. the proposed agreement includes creating a countywide hotline for reporting child sexual abuse allegations against employees and developing a system to expedite investigations, officials said. by balancing justice for the victims with a commitment to reform, this resolution ensures both acknowledgment of past wrongs and a pathway to a safer, more accountable future, patrick mcnicholas, one of the plaintiffs attorneys, said in a statement. the countys claims board will consider the proposed settlement monday. if approved, it would be considered by the board of supervisors on april 29. ___ taxin reported from santa ana, california. associated press writer olga r. rodríguez in san francisco contributed. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
