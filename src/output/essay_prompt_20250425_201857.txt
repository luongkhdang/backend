  Title: Supreme Court hears clash over gay storybooks...
  Source: abcnews.go.com (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights how the Montgomery County school board's decision to include LGBTQ-themed storybooks in the curriculum has brought the issue of parental rights and religious freedom to the forefront of public discourse. The article states, "starting in 2022, montgomery county - one of the most diverse counties in the country - introduced a series of lgbtq-themed storybooks for reading in elementary school classrooms under a statewide mandate to be more inclusive of the diversity of families and children attending the schools." This action has set the agenda for debate, forcing the Supreme Court to address the conflict between religious beliefs and inclusive education.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the Trump administration "moves to empower parents and root out diversity and inclusion initiatives across the u.s. education system." This suggests a broader political agenda at play. What other policies or actions might the Trump administration have taken to influence education, and how might these actions be connected to the current case before the Supreme Court?

and that the constitution does not guarantee students the right to skip lessons inconsistent with their beliefs. lower courts sided with the board. the justices will now take a closer look at whether the countys refusal to grant an opt-out to parents illegally burdens their religious rights. school districts nationwide are grappling with demands from parents to opt-out their children from lesson plans they claim are counter to religious beliefs. abc news the case is a good illustration of the fact that public schools are at ground zero in the culture wars, said jim walsh, a texas lawyer who represents school boards and is a member of the national school attorneys association. we all want the school to reflect our values, but we dont agree on our values. and certainly issues about same-sex marriage, the rights of lesbians and gays, are right at the center of that, he said. starting in 2022, montgomery county - one of the most diverse counties in the country - introduced a series of lgbtq-themed storybooks for reading in elementary school classrooms under a statewide mandate to be more inclusive of the diversity of families and children attending the schools. montgomery county, md., is at the center of a supreme court battle over lgbtq storybooks and some parents claims of a constitutional right to opt-out their children from readings. abc news the local school board, which closely consulted with educators in approving the curriculum, maintains that the books do not take a side on issues of gender or sexuality and that teachers are instructed not to teach or enforce any particular view. among the illustrated titles is uncle bobbys wedding by sarah brannen, about a young girl who worries her close relationship with a beloved uncle will change after he marries his male fiance. prince knight by daniel haack presents a fairy-tale narrative about a blossoming romance between the main characters after a dramatic rescue from a dragon. daniel haack is the author of prince knight, an illustrated childrens book featuring gay characters. abc news nothing in my book is any different than most fairy tales that have some sort of romance at the center of it, said haack. nothing different than sleeping beauty or cinderella or any of those. in the book intersection allies, a group of three sociologist authors set out to simplify complex ideas about identity, including what it means to be nonbinary. we wrote this to affirm kids who are left out of the stories that we often tell, said latoya council, one of the authors. this book is not saying that, you know, your child has to choose to be transgender. its saying respect someone who is trans and their ability to seek spaces that are comfortable for them. three sociologists and authors of the childrens book intersection allies chelsea johnson, latoya council, carolyn choi speak with abc news about their desire to simplify complex ideas about identity. abc news chelsea johnson, another of the books authors, insisted nothing in the text asks anyone to change their beliefs. schools and parents and communities are partners with each other and helping kids make sense of the world and we dont have to opt our kids out to do that. montgomery county guidelines advise educators to make the storybooks available for students to read on their own, to read aloud, or share in reading groups. teachers are instructed not to advance a particular viewpoint about sexuality or gender with respect to the characters. at first, during the 2022-2023 school year, the board allowed parents to opt-out their kids from any lessons involving the books, but it later changed course, denying any opt-outs. billy moges, a mother of 3 and devout christian, says she withdrew her children from montgomery county, md., public schools over administrators refusal to let them opt-out from the reading of storybooks involving lgbtq themes. abc news when i was in school, i was opted-out of sex ed because i wasnt ready, and my parents didnt feel it was appropriate for the teachers to talk about it, and it didnt hurt anyone, said billy moges, a mother of three and devout christian, who pulled her kids from montgomery county schools because of the books. the problem with some of these books, though, as well, is they were love stories, so it was not just exposure to lgbtq characters. these were love stories, said elkoshairi. school officials explained in court documents that administering an opt-out program became too cumbersome to manage, led to higher rates of student absenteeism, and was ultimately inconsistent with an educational mission of supporting all types of families. emily and sharon mcgowan of montgomery county, md., have a second and sixth-grader enrolled in public schools. abc news these books are representing the community that is surrounding these children, said emily mcgowan, who mothers second- and sixth-graders with her wife sharon in montgomery county. you cannot deny that we exist. we live here, our kids go to school here. the mcgowans say opt-outs over lgbtq stories harm the children whose family lives are represented in the books. the idea that 10 of their classmates get to get up and walk out because theres two mommies in this book - what is the message thats sent to our kid who has two mommies? said sharon mcgowan. that something is so offensive about this that they get to walk out and maybe they even get to go to the playground and have extra play time? nearly every state gives parents the ability to opt-out their children from sex education classes but opt-outs for lgbtq issues vary widely by community and are often decided by board members elected by local parents, walsh said. the supreme court is seen in washington, jan. 10, 2025. abc news we can all understand parents having strong feelings about when and how is my child going to be taught about sexual issues. so, there are more opt-outs about this than anything else. but if the supreme court rules in favor of the plaintiffs in this case, its not gonna stop with just sex and gender issues. it will cover a wide variety of things that parents may have objections to, he said. the case comes as the trump administration has vowed to give more control over education to local leaders and communities. but even in places where school boards are choosing to prioritize diversity, equity and inclusion in their curriculum - like montgomery county - some conservatives are still pushing to override policies. sarah brannen is the author of uncle bobbys wedding, an illustrated childrens book featuring a gay couple and their niece. abc news the school board has decided to disrupt the thinking of their children on an area that has long been understood as going to the core of parental authority for their children, on sex and gender, said will haun, a senior attorney at becket fund for religious liberty, which is representing the plaintiffs before the supreme court. in that area, the first amendment absolutely protects the parents. the democratic process is important, and thats where we debate curriculum, haun added, but here were talking about restoring an opt-out right, which is not a challenge to the curriculum. wael elkoshairi insists he harbors no ill will toward lgbtq families and says he isnt calling for a ban on any books. but he hopes the high court - as a matter of faith - will give parents greater control. wael elkosairi is among hundreds of montgomery county, md., parents of public school children hoping the u.s. supreme court will establish a constitutional right to opt-out of lessons that conflict with religious beliefs. abc news when people have differences of opinion on certain things, accommodations work well to relieve everybody, and we move on, elkosairi said. as for the mcgowans, they are hoping the courts conservative majority holds the line. the fact that the court took the case at all - i dont have reason to believe that they took the case to affirm the importance of inclusion in the public schools, said sharon mcgowan. if harm is done by their decision, we will figure out what we need to do at a personal and a community level to mitigate that harm. people walk past the u.s. supreme court, in washington, april 21, 2025. abc news a decision in the case is expected by the end of june.

  Title: Worries About Flying Seem to Be Taking Off. Here's How to Cope With In-Flight Anxiety
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-23 13:20:37)
  Content: new york ap adelynn campbells last plane trip ended with a panic attack that she got through largely with the help of a kind flight attendant. that was last year before 67 people died in january when an american airlines jet collided with a helicopter over washington, d.c., in the deadliest u.s. air disaster in almost a quarter century. now, campbell is even more hesitant to book a flight. its definitely spiked my concern about getting on a plane and its making the whole situation a little more stressful than it used to be, said campbell, 30, who manages a coffee shop in san diego. being at least a little nervous about flying is understandable. as mel brooks once said if god wanted us to fly, he would have given us tickets. but for some people it causes deep anxiety that could require professional help. heres a look at air travel anxiety and ways to cope with it. more people seem to be nervous about flying the evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say theyve seen and heard increased worries and not only in people who already had anxieties about flying. even people who didnt have a fear of flying are talking about it, given recent events, said jennifer dragonette, a california-based psychologist who treats people with air travel anxieties. u.s. air travel was down in march and early april compared with last year, according to tsa statistics. airlines have attributed the decline to economic uncertainty, a decline in government and corporate travel and yes concern about recent aviation incidents. faa officials recently acknowledged they werent doing enough to ensure air safety. recent polling by the associated press-norc center for public affairs research shows that fewer americans report feeling safe about flying this year. flight attendants who work planes out of the washington, d.c., airport were particularly rattled by the january collision, said sara nelson, president of the association of flight attendants union. some asked for time off to process their emotions, and at least one flight attendant left the job, she said. what is fear of flying? fear of flying sometimes called aerophobia goes beyond just being nervous about a flight. it is an intense form of anxiety that centers on certain aspects of air travel. many aerophobes get most rattled during take-off and landing, or when they think about being locked in a plane. some research has suggested it affects about 25 million u.s. adults. psychologists say it often surfaces in adulthood, developing in people who didnt mind flying as kids but grew more rattled as they aged. in many cases, it starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, at a time they are experiencing big life changes and new responsibilities like getting married or becoming a parent and they start to think that everything counts, said david carbonell, a chicago-based psychologist who authored a workbook to help people cope with flying fears. a bad flight with heavy turbulence or some other problem may trigger an anxiety that persists, he said. campbell, who has other forms of anxiety, developed a fear of flying a few years ago. she is transgender, and said travel can be stressful because of concerns about how shell be treated by airport security or in other interactions. aerophobia can be complicated, carbonell said. for many people, its not so much a fear of crashing as it is claustrophobic feelings of being in an enclosed cabin and not having control. campbell said thats what she experiences feeling trapped and unable to breathe. nelson said flight attendants regularly deal with suffering passengers weve had people have panic attacks, and weve had to give them oxygen. it can be quite intense. how to cope with flying anxiety statistics have long shown that airliners are probably the safest way to travel. according to the national safety council, the odds of dying in an airplane crash are too low to be calculated, based on 2023 statistics making them far, far lower than of being killed in a motor vehicle crash or, for that matter, walking on a sidewalk or crossing a street. but experts say you cant really reason your way out of an anxiety disorder. carbonell spends little time on statistics, telling patients i know you already looked at them all, and theyre not helping you. for people with milder levels of aerophobia, deep breathing often works. longer exhales help the body relax, said dragonette, who counseled campbell for aerophobia and other anxiety disorders at a newport healthcare residential facility in temecula, california. people suffering more extreme cases can be helped with exposure therapy. it can start by simply getting patients to become comfortable looking at photos of planes, watching videos of planes flying safely, or putting on a virtual reality headset that shows recordings of being inside a plane, dragonette said. its a matter of getting patients to learn to live with their feelings and better handle them. carbonell recommends patients take practice flights that do not involve work trips or any other responsibilities. when they have symptoms, he recommends they keep a written inventory. theyre keeping a simple count, he said. were using counting as a proxy for acceptance. its ok to ask for help nelson, who was a longtime united airlines flight attendant, says ive had situations where id sort of sit in the aisle and hold someones hand. on a frontier airlines flight last year from detroit to san diego, campbell tried breathing and other coping skills, but they didnt halt her panic attack. the passenger next to her noticed she was increasingly anxious, and summoned a flight attendant. the flight attendant took deep breaths with campbell and helped her get through it, and also took down campbells phone number and checked on her a day later. i was really impressed, she said. ___ the associated press health and science department receives support from the howard hughes medical institutes science and educational media group and the robert wood johnson foundation. the ap is solely responsible for all content. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: Teens are losing their minds over college rejections — we need to give them some perspective
  Source: nypost.com (2025-04-01 16:54:15)
  Content: college admissions decisions are pushing kids off the deep end. of the 1.2 million kids who applied to college this year, many of them wont get into their dream school, which will be a huge gut-punch from admissions officers they will never meet, analyzing factors beyond their control. as results come out, we have to remind them of something that seems far less obvious when youre seventeen the college you go to does not define you, even if 76 of high schoolers say that the college admissions process is a life-defining event. admissions has morphed into a torturous, all-consuming years-long process that can leave any kid feeling like an abject failure in spite of their accomplishments. college rejection depression has its own corner of the internet. things have become so bad, sources have told the post instances of self-harm and even suicide have been linked to college decisions at elite prep schools. social media is also awash with theories linking student deaths to admissions. for the sake of youth mental health, we have to instill in young people that life is worth living, even at your backup school. dr. dee apple, a clinical psychologist in princeton, new jersey, who served as the director of counseling at the lawrenceville school for more than two decades, described college decision season as a time where the tension on campus among seniors was palpable. for people who are already vulnerable, meaning they have a tendency to depression or anxiety or self-esteem problems, or even come from very intense family situations those kids can end up in an unhealthy situation, apple told the post. hes right. as a graduate of lawrenceville a prep school that sends more than a third of its graduates to the ivy league i remember the contagious anxiety of friends crumbling under the pressure. you couldnt get through a conversation without a question about where youre applying or which common app essay prompt you chose. i assumed it would be parents and teachers pressuring students who didnt really care, a calculus teacher at a public school in seattle observed. its actually the exact opposite teachers are telling these kids to slow down and not worry so much, and the kids are the ones who drive each other crazy. opening a deferral letter from my dream school, columbia university, felt like the end of the world. but i wish i could tell my teenage self that, now just seven years later that couldnt be further from the truth. virtually nobody asks me where i went to school, and my accomplishments since speak more for me than just a diploma would. and im not the only one who regrets how much self-worth i placed in college admissions. shivam gandhi, 26, is getting his phd in systems biology at harvard, after previously studying at brown. but he was devastated when his dream school, mit, rejected him as a teen, especially because he felt his family was comparing him to other kids in their immigrant community. the college admissions process turned me into somebody that i really deep down am not, gandhi, told the post. with my parents always saying, oh look at what hes doing, maybe youre not as smart as him, i ended up developing a ton of anxiety. dr. apple says parental college pressure can diminish kids self-worth. his advice to parents is you might want to look in the mirror and ask, why am i doing this? is this going to make my son happier? is this going to make my daughter more well-rounded? am i pushing them into a place of some vulnerability mental health wise? kids and parents alike need to accept a hard truth pinning their value on an acceptance letter is a losing battle, especially at elite schools, where competition is getting ever-steeper. take harvard for example. they admitted 2,195 students into the class of 1982, which is more than the 1,937 admitted for 2028. meanwhile, in that time, the population of the united states grew by about 100 million, and international students gobble up a far larger percentage of admissions offers than they used to. this means teens practically need to start a charity or cure a rare disease to make the cut. and even a kid who does manage to reinvent the wheel before theyre old enough to drive a car might find a rejection letter in their hands. there simply arent enough spots. is it any wonder kids are cracking? one anonymous manhattan mom told me her son, who is now at boston college, was a mess during the admissions process. she spent 40,000 on a college admissions counselor and 10,000 on tutors. at one point he screamed at me why havent you done anything, she told me. i replied that i got him an advisor and a tutor. he hollered back why havent you done anything to change the college admissions process? clearly, we need to instill some faith in our kids that everything is going to be alright. in retrospect gandhi says that mits rejection was a blessing in disguise. im really glad that they rejected me, he said. at brown, i was able to date, to spend time with friends, and to actually invest more in the emotional side of my life than i would have been able to at mit. what do you think? post a comment. some advice he wishes he could give his younger self your trajectory doesnt stop here. if you work hard in your undergrad, you can still get to where you want to go. the smartest people ive met at harvard went to colleges ive never heard of. we need to remind kids that they cant control whether the admissions person at their dream school is going to be having a bad day when they come across their application. whether its divine intervention or the universe or mere coincidence, wherever they end up will be just fine. but, most important of all, we need to help give teens some perspective. it might not feel true when youre a senior in high school, but you absolutely are so much more than the school you go to.

    - Transportation Security Administration:
      > Snippet: ash lazarus orr was accused in early january by the u.s. transportation security administration of using fake documents when traveling from west virginia to new york
  Content: boston ap a federal judge on friday partially blocked the trump administration from enacting a policy that bans the use of x marker used by many nonbinary people on passports as well as the changing of gender markers. u.s. district judge julia kobick, who was appointed by president joe biden, sided with the american civil liberties unions motion for a preliminary injunction, which stays the action while the lawsuit plays out. it requires the state department to allow six transgender and nonbinary people who are plaintiffs in the lawsuit to obtain passports with sex designations consistent with their gender identity. the executive order and the passport policy on their face classify passport applicants on the basis of sex and thus must be reviewed under intermediate judicial scrutiny, kobick wrote. that standard requires the government to demonstrate that its actions are substantially related to an important governmental interest. the government has failed to meet this standard. kobick also said plaintiffs have shown they would succeed in demonstrating that the new passport policy and executive order are based on irrational prejudice toward transgender americans and therefore offend our nations constitutional commitment to equal protection for all americans. in addition, the plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed on their claim that the passport policy is arbitrary and capricious, and that it was not adopted in compliance with the procedures required by the paperwork reduction act and administrative procedure act, she added. in an executive order signed in january, the president used a narrow definition of the sexes instead of a broader conception of gender. the order says a person is male or female and it rejects the idea that someone can transition from the sex assigned at birth to another gender. the framing is in line with many conservatives views but at odds with major medical groups and policies under former president joe biden. the aclu, which sued the trump administration, said the new policy would effectively mean transgender, nonbinary and intersex americans could not get an accurate passport. this decision is a critical victory against discrimination and for equal justice under the law, said li nowlin-sohl, senior staff attorney for the aclus lgbtq hiv project. but its also a historic win in the fight against this administrations efforts to drive transgender people out of public life. the state departments policy is a baseless barrier for transgender and intersex americans and denies them the dignity we all deserve. nowlin-sohl said it plans to file a motion requesting the ruling be applied to all transgender and nonbinary americans. in its lawsuit, the aclu described how one woman had her passport returned with a male designation while others are too scared to submit their passports because they fear their applications might be suspended and their passports held by the state department. another mailed in their passport on jan. 9 and requested a name change and to change their sex designation from male to female. that person is still waiting for their passport meaning they cant leave canada where they live and could miss a family wedding in may and a botany conference in july. before he applied for his new passport, ash lazarus orr was accused in early january by the u.s. transportation security administration of using fake documents when traveling from west virginia to new york since he had a male designation on his drivers license but a female one on his passport. that prompted him to request the updated passport with a sex designation of male four days before trump took office. in response to the lawsuit, the trump administration argued the passport policy change does not violate the equal protection guarantees of the constitution. they also contended that the president has broad discretion in setting passport policy and that plaintiffs would not be harmed by the policy, since they are still free to travel abroad. some plaintiffs additionally allege that having inconsistent identification documents will heighten the risk that an official will discover that they are transgender, the justice department wrote. but the department is not responsible for plaintiffs choice to change their sex designation for state documents but not their passport. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: DEI Rollbacks Hit Campus Support Systems for Students of Color
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-19 04:09:41)
  Content: washington ap campus mentors. move-in events. scholarships. diversity offices that made them feel welcome on predominantly white campuses. as u.s. colleges pull back on diversity, equity and inclusion practices, students of color say they are starting to lose all of these things and more. the full scope of campus dei rollbacks is still emerging as colleges respond to the trump administrations orders against diversity practices. but students at some schools said early cuts are chipping away at the sense of community that helped open the door to higher education. it feels like were going back. i dont know how else to describe it, said breeana-iris rosario, a junior at the university of michigan, which is closing its dei office and scrapping a campus-wide inclusion plan. its like our voices arent being heard. the retreat from dei has been building for years, driven by republican-led states that have ordered public colleges to close dei offices and eliminate programs. but it has accelerated under president donald trump and his threats to cut federal funding. trumps administration escalated the battle when it suggested in a letter to harvard university that the school should lose its nonprofit status for defying federal orders, including a demand to eliminate dei to the satisfaction of the federal government. at michigan, students have been told the casualties include orientation events for new latino, arab and asian american students, along with the lead scholars program, a financial aid award for black, latino and native american students. coming from a low-income part of detroit, rosario said winning the scholarship cemented her decision to attend michigan. she later met some of her best friends at a move-in event for latino students called alma. losing those programs, she fears, could reinforce a sense of isolation among hispanic students, who make up 6 of the schools undergraduates. it would be hard to find my community if i didnt have access to these resources, she said. colleges respond to federal orders a february memo from the education department directed schools and colleges to eliminate race from any decision-making around hiring, admissions, housing, financial aid and student life. it warned violators could lose access to federal money. dozens of universities have since come under investigation, all while the trump administration freezes billions of dollars at harvard and other colleges accused of defying orders on campus antisemitism and transgender athletes. michigan was among the first to make major dei rollbacks, and others have followed to avoid federal scrutiny. others have rebranded dei offices and scrubbed the term from websites, and others still are standing firm in support of dei. at case western reserve university in cleveland, officials cited the federal orders when they moved to close the campus dei office last month. it is clear we must be in compliance with them to receive the federal funding that is critical to our present and future, said eric kaler, cases president, in a campus message. kaler said the office will be replaced by an office for campus enrichment and engagement, though its unclear what that will entail. the private university receives about 250 million a year in federal research funding, 16 of its total revenue, according to university data. justen pippens said the dei office was like a second home on campus. the junior called it a stress-free zone where he could get personal and academic guidance. he grew so close with one staff member that he came to know her as auntie. he said its unclear whether those employees will have jobs at the new office. case also is halting its envision weekend, an orientation event for underrepresented students. pippens said its a setback for him and other black students, who make up just 6 of undergraduates at case. now, he said, we no longer have our central support systems on campus. a victory for dei opponents in virginia, republican gov. glenn youngkin celebrated when the university of virginias governing board voted to end dei programs in march. dei is done at the university of virginia, youngkin said in a statement, calling it a shift toward merit-based opportunity. tyler english, a senior at uva, said students have been told scholarships and graduate programs focused on minority students are being scaled back or eliminated. among other changes, a student group called men of color, honor and ambition is replacing the word color with character, he said. for a portion of us, we now question whether our identities and voices are truly valued in this space, said english, a member of the campus black student alliance. university spokesperson brian coy wouldnt provide details on dei rollbacks and said he couldnt confirm changes to scholarships. the governments anti-dei campaign is being challenged in court by opponents who say it offers little clarity on exactly which practices are outlawed, leaving schools to weed out anything that could be construed as dei. as a result of the vague directives, those who are advocating against this work are getting a higher return on their investment than they should, said paulette granberry russell, president of the national association of diversity officers in higher education. yet opponents are pressing the white house to go further. christopher rufo, a conservative strategist who has fought dei, said the government should root out dei using tools that forced desegregation during the civil rights movement. dei is a violation of the civil rights act, rufo said on x. any publicly funded institution that continues to practice dei should face a federal investigation, consent decree, termination of funds, and loss of nonprofit status. if that doesnt work, send in the 101st airborne. some fear diversity setbacks in michigan, the rollbacks are targeting programs that aimed to preserve racial diversity after the state banned affirmative action in 2006, including the lead program. university of michigan officials declined to discuss changes, but a campus message from president santa ono said the school will find other ways to support students, including an expansion of scholarships for low-income students. rosario and other lead scholarship winners received an email saying there would be no adverse financial impact to their financial aid, with no further explanation. rosario doesnt entirely blame the university for the cuts, but she wonders why michigan moved quickly to make changes while some colleges held firm. the first in her family to attend college, she fears what it means for the next generation of students. theyve taken away our sense of community, she said. it just makes it that much harder for people of color to feel comfortable pursuing higher education. ___ ap education writer cheyanne mumphrey in phoenix contributed to this report. ___ the associated press education

  Title: Florida teacher loses job for calling student by preferred name...

  Content: a florida high school teacher lost her job after calling a student by an alternative name without parental permission, sparking community backlash in the conservative birthplace of moms for liberty as school officials sought to comply with state law. its the first known dismissal resulting from the campaign to shut down recognition of alternative gender identities a policy piloted by florida that spread to other republican states and now has been taken up by the trump administration. melissa calhoun had taught in brevard county for 11 years when she ran headlong into a state rule that bars school staff from deviating from students legal names without written parental permission. the rule applies to students who choose an alternative name because of a change in gender identity, as well as those who might want to use a nickname. in this case, calhoun was respecting the wishes of a student whose legal name is associated with girls, a person familiar with the situation said. one of the students parents complained to the school district, which investigated the matter. the teacher admitted to knowingly using an alternative name without permission, district spokeswoman janet murnaghan said in a statement. this directly violates state law and district procedures, she said. the teacher received a letter of reprimand and was told last week that her annual contract, which expires in may, was not renewed, though she will finish out this school year. the school district supports parents rights to be the primary decision-makers in their childrens lives, and florida law affirms their right to be informed, murnaghan said. teachers, like all employees, are expected to follow the law. calhouns contract was not renewed because the state of florida will be reviewing her teaching certificate based on this case, murnaghan said, and the district will not bring her back until the issue is resolved with the state. a spokesperson for the florida department of education did not respond to a request for comment. calhoun, who has worked at satellite high school since 2019, could not be reached for comment. the action prompted a surge of student and parent activism on calhouns behalf a striking response in a county where one of the founders of moms for liberty, a national group on the front lines of the education culture wars, once served on the school board. more than 7,400 people signed a change.org petition calling for her to be reinstated. students planned a walkout of classes on thursday afternoon in support of the teacher. and while the matter was not on the agenda at the school boards meeting this week, several members of the community spoke on her behalf during a public comment period. there was no harm, no threat to safety, no malicious intent. just a teacher trying to connect with a student. and for that her contract was not renewed, despite her strong dedication and years of service, kristine staniec, a media specialist at satellite high school, told the board. she said her children were students of calhouns. im seeing people who never got involved before signing the petition and commenting on facebook, said amy roub, a parent in brevard county and volunteer with floridas chapter of defense of democracy, a group formed to oppose moms for liberty. i think people have just had enough of this from the school board. theyve gone too far this time. two of roubs four children had calhoun for a teacher in their advanced placement literature class, and roub recalled being struck by her love for teaching when she first met her. calhoun also made it a point to attend student performances at the school, roub said. satellite is an arts magnet school set on a barrier island south of cape canaveral. she is a beloved teacher, a teacher that changed her students lives, roub said. but school board member katye campbell said teachers are trained to follow state rules, and its reasonable to expect that they will do so. she said people may think the rule is silly, but she said its important. the parents are the number one decision-makers for their children. thats why we send out the form, thats why the state board of education made the rule, campbell said. asked about the rights of the students, she said it was not the districts place to interfere in family relationships unless we legally have a reason to. tiffany justice, a founder of moms for liberty who lives in neighboring indian river county, asked, would you want your kids teachers keeping secrets from you with your child? the nickname rule, with official documentation in the parental authorization for deviation from students legal name form, stems from a 2023 law, one of several championed by gov. ron desantis r as part of his war on woke. other desantis-backed measures led to a crush of challenges to books in school libraries and restrictions on how race and gender can be taught. similar rules prohibiting schools from using alternative names or pronouns are in place in 13 other states, but this appears to be the first time a teacher has lost his or her job for violating the policies, said brian dittmeier, director of public policy for glsen, an advocacy group for lgbtq students. not only is this a direct attack on educators who support trans students, but it also is an indicator of the bureaucratic overreach of antitransgender policy, dittmeier said. a teacher could potentially be fired for calling a student tim instead of timothy. the trump administration is also taking action on this front. on his first day in office, president donald trump signed an executive order stating that it is the policy of the united states to recognize two sexes, male and female. last month, the federal education department announced it was investigating the states of california and maine over policies that limit school communication with parents about their childrens gender. the california law, signed last year, bars school districts from requiring staff to notify parents of their childs gender identification change. maine policy allows students to use alternative names or pronouns without parental notification, the federal agency said. parents are the primary protectors of their children. yet many states and school districts have enacted policies that presume children need protection from their parents, education secretary linda mcmahon wrote in a letter to educators delivered with new guidance about how states should interpret federal privacy law. the guidance said that under federal law, parents have a right to see their students records, but schools do not have a legal obligation to inform parents about information in those records absent a request.

  Title: Transgender Influencer Takes on Trump in Legal Battle Over Passports
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-10 16:11:20)
  Content: by nate raymond, omar younis, roselle chen boston reuters -when zaya perysian received her new passport in the mail in late january, she knew exactly who to blame for why it listed her, a transgender woman, as male u.s. president donald trump. first the california social media influencer took to tiktok to express her frustrations with what she called the big ugly m the u.s. state department under trump mandated her new passport feature. and then she sued, along with six other transgender and non-binary people who argue the policy is unconstitutional. the 22-year-old is now waiting to see whether a federal judge in boston agrees. the closely watched case is challenging a policy the department adopted in accordance with an executive order signed by the republican president on his first day back in office. that executive order directed the federal government to recognize only two, biologically distinct sexes - male and female - and directed the state department to change its policies to only issue passports that accurately reflect the holders sex. this is something that has been forced upon me, basically, perysian said, in an interview with reuters with her lawyer at the american civil liberties union present. and its really unfair and kind of crazy, but thats why were fighting it. the u.s. state department declined to comment. the u.s. department of justice, which is defending the policy in court, did not respond to requests for comment. the administration has argued the policy does not constitute unlawful sex discrimination, does not prevent transgender people from traveling abroad, and is vital to addressing the concerns trumps executive order raised that indeterminate definitions of sex undermine longstanding, cherished legal rights and values. perysian has lived as a transgender woman in all aspects of her life since 2020, according to court papers. she said she has had surgical procedures and had secured changes to other government documents like her drivers license to match her gender identity. she had submitted on january 23 an expedited application to update the sex designation on her passport to female. but by then, trump was in office, and less than a week later her passport was returned to her with a notice stating her sex was corrected on your passport application. at the end of the day, im a woman, and i dont care how many people agree or disagree, she said. i live every day as a woman. i surround myself with people who see me and respect me as a woman. the lawsuit she joined was filed by lawyers at the aclu, who argued the policy unconstitutionally discriminates against transgender people and exposes them to potential harm if they travel abroad with passports reflecting a different sex designation to their gender identity. this executive order made it impossible for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex americans to have accurate federal identity documents, including their passports, said aclu attorney sruti swaminathan. lawyers for the plaintiffs say the policy reversed decades of practice at the state department, which for more than 30 years allowed people to update the sex designation on their passports. in 2022, democratic president joe bidens administration allowed passport applicants for the first time to choose x as a neutral sex marker on their passport applications, as well as being able to self-select m or f for male or female. benjamin takemoto, a justice department lawyer, previously told u.s. district judge julia kobick, who is overseeing the lawsuit, that trump has broad discretion to determine rules for issuing passports, allowing him to scrap bidens policy to ensure a consistent approach to identifying individuals throughout the federal government. but during a march 25 hearing, kobick, a biden appointee, appeared skeptical of that argument. kobick, who has yet to rule, at the hearing sharply questioned how the policy could not be considered discriminatory. it seems to deny that gender identity is something worth recognizing, she said. reporting by nate raymond in boston, omar younis in los angeles and roselle chen in new york editing by stephen coates, alexia garamfalvi and rosalba obrien

  Title: The Cardboard-Carrying Opposition Arrives
  Source: www.theatlantic.com (2025-04-05 18:30:00)
  Content: the hands off protest in washington, d.c., drew thousands of people with a lot of feelingsbut as-yet-inchoate anger at the trump administration. the opposition arrived in a flurry of painted cardboard. until this week, the 11th of donald trumps second presidency, the resistance has not exactly been uppercase r. any show of dissent by democratic leadership has been virtually nonexistent, and protests against trumps policies have been small and sporadic. citizen frustration with the new administration has registered nationally as little more than a distant rumble. todays hands off protest, organized by a coalition of left-wing groups, was an attempt to raise the volume. people carted their megaphones and rainbow flags to more than 1,200 sites across the country todayin d.c., of course, but also in helena, montana daytona beach, florida and dubuque, iowa. the events spanned all 50 states, the organizers said, plus a few more exotic locales, such as guadalajara, lisbon, and paris. washington had expected to draw about 10,000 protesters in the end, several times that showed up. in interviews with some of those gathered today on the national mall, demonstrators told me that they were under no illusion that trump or elon musk would be much swayed by their anger or creative signage. the point, they said, was to show the rest of america that the opposition existsand is widespread. this is not for them, gina king, a retired teacher from new york city, told me. this is for us. the first mass protest of this administration was well timed. the week began with cory bookers record-breaking 25-hour tirade against trump from the senate floor. the monologue accomplished nothing tangiblethough it threw bookers oura-ring readings out of whackbut it was a welcome stunt for voters who have been craving louder public rage against the administrations actions. what says outrage more than a man willing to hold it for 25 hours? then, on tuesday night, democrats in wisconsin won the first electoral test of trumps second presidency, by defeating a state-supreme-court candidate backed by trump and 20 million from musk. also on tuesday, one of the largest mass layoffs of federal workers to date began, when employees at the cdc and the fda were dismissed. finally, on thursday, trumps tariffs sent americans retirement savings plunging, triggered manufacturer layoffs, and forced cnbc to bring its bear-market graphic out of hibernation. king, the retired teacher, carried a sign thanking booker and wisconsinites for their efforts in the fight against trump. she protested the president during the womens march in early 2017, but this political moment is different, she told me. it feels more desperate, she said. we should all be standing in front of the supreme court every day, in front of the national institutes of health every day. half a dozen federal employees spoke with me at the protest, but none wanted to share their full name for fear of retribution from the trump administration. im here because i feel powerless, said a man named edward, who had just been forced out of his longtime government job. he carried a sign mocking the five bullet points that federal employees are now required to submit weekly to musks doge. in the original womens march, we were very concerned with womens rights, but now hes touching all areas, tracie, an employee in the department of veterans affairs, told me. she was willing to risk her job to show up at the protest, together with her daughter and granddaughter, she told me, because she wants america to see her anger. the administration is completely discounting us. theyre saying were bought, were paid for, were bused in. but the opposition to trump is real, she said. we are out here. on the mall, it was difficult to pinpoint a chief complaint or singular demand. hands off what, exactly? i asked. there were so many things to be furious about. no single piece of cardstock could contain it all. people carried posters about the administrations deportation of immigrants and dissident students laura loomers oval office influence musks taking a chain saw to the federal government the return of preventable diseases the technological ineptitude of trumps defense officials and attacks on abortion rights. many of those i spoke with cited creeping fascism. theres been a total disregard of habeas corpus, larry bostian, a retiree from silver spring, maryland, told me. democracy is in a death spiral. paul singleton, an air force veteran from stafford, virginia, agreed. i used to wonder, how did hitler do what he did? he said. when trump got into office and started appointing all these people, i stopped. given the stakes, people wanted to know, where was democratic party leadership? katrin hinrichsen, a retired computer engineer from connecticut, had brought a few signage options, including one that read time to chuck schumer. i want some effective leadership of the democratic minority, she told me. a few democratic lawmakers addressed the rally in d.c., including representatives jamie raskin of maryland and ilhan omar of minnesota. they were speaking on a stage somewhere amid the dense crowd gathered at the base of the washington monument. but most people couldnt hear them some had no idea there was a stage at all. instead, parts of the rally devolved into a kind of hippie picnic, where sign carriers chatted in circles or plopped on the grass to eat sandwiches. one woman handed out nuts and dried fruit cashews, anyone? another laughed with her friendsthe last time i felt safe in a crowd this big was at a taylor swift concert! weve been scattered weve been demoralized, bostian, the retiree from silver spring, told me, looking at the sea of people around him. but this is awesome. the 2017 womens march connected protesters who kept in touch, established resistance groups in their hometowns, and eventually helped elect a wave of new democrats during the 2018 midterms. todays protesters think that they can do it again. they just need the rest of america to hear them.

the hate spiraled from there. the teacher started receiving hate mail on her personal and school email accounts, she said. sandri told the independent wednesday that she felt she had to step down for my safety and the safety of the students. she added it was a decision that broke my heart. it felt very defeating. but it felt it was the only thing i could do. people have sent me messages telling me to unalive myself, sandri said in a tiktok monday, adding that others have sent her transphobic slurs and threats to harm her. several lawmakers were among those spreading the transphobic rhetoric. south carolina congresswoman nancy mace commented, referring to sandri as it while texas state rep. brian harrison reposted libs of tiktoks post. harrison, who represents red oak, texas, where sandri teaches, demanded she be immediately terminated and noted he was in touch with her school district. the independent has reached out to a representative for mace for comment. a spokesperson for the texas lawmaker told the independent in a statement that he was glad to see that just three days after i demanded his termination, she will no longer be teaching students in my district. he continued public schools are for education, not indoctrination. any teacher who claims to get gender euphoria from their minor students and teaches them that boys can become girls should be terminated immediately. in a tiktok posted tuesday, sandri clarified that she did not force the children to change her pronouns i told them they could call me whatever they wanted. in the video made viral by libs of tiktok, sandri posted about feeling gender euphoria, or positive feelings associated with the alignment of ones gender identity and expression, after being called maam by someone at a gas station as well as by her students. it was such a small thing to make me this happy, she said in the tiktok. after telling her sophomore students that she had changed her pronouns, the kids were completely on board, sandri said in the video. they call me maam, they call me miss, they use my correct pronouns and know my correct name. and it is incredibly affirming. she said the small gesture of calling a trans individual by their proper pronouns could transform her entire day. but many x users took away a completely different message, calling for sandri to be nowhere near children, claiming she suffers from a mental illness because shes trans, and suggesting parents take their kids out of public school. a grown man gets euphoria from children affirming his delusions. this is not a teacher this is someone who belongs far away from children, one user remarked. another wrote there is the sickness on full display. the only affirmation you should need is that your students learn what they come to school to learn. thats the job. not to affirm your desires and sexuality. this man needs to be removed from teaching children immediately! this is disgusting! he is a child predator! another commented. one user, trump world, harshly said i would rather have a literal monkey teaching students. in an email sent to school staff this week, beth trimble, the districts chief communications officer, underscored the social media policy. your freedom of speech is not free of consequences if it results in a disruption of your ability to do your job, the email, obtained by nbc news, said. the email sent to staff was not related to sandri, trimble said in a statement to the independent, noting it was a reminder as we enter election season and is also sent at the start of the school year. asked about the circumstances of sandris resignation, trimble said in light of recent attention, red oak high school english teacher sandri has resigned, effective march 31, 2025. any other information is a personnel matter, and we are not at liberty to discuss. on tuesday after sandri announced her resignation, libs of tiktok wrote on x big win for students and parents in texas. in the days since her resignation, sandri said the hateful rhetoric has not died down, in part because her video was pinned to the top of libs of tiktoks page once again. she said she feels some fear by continuing to post on a public account, but shes vowed to not be silenced online and continues to post on tiktok. i want to speak out. educate people, sandri said. i am not afraid of brian harrison or libs of tiktok. all theyve done is make an activist out of me. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Content: biologist the religion of anti-religionists i resigned from the freedom from religion foundation, explains jerry a. coyne at the wall street journal, because it had abandoned science. in november, it posted an essay denying the basic biological fact that all animals, including humans, have only two sexes. it ran his rebuttal, biology is not bigotry, but quickly took it down saying that was an error in judgment. in many ways, transgender ideology is no different from the religious dogma the ffrf was founded to oppose. it tars dissenters as transphobes, silences critics and proselytizes in schools proponents deem themselves morally correct. in fact, biological sex is a scientific issue, but the ffrf has abandoned science for an embrace of quasireligious dogma, so im proud to proclaim myself a heretic. ed desk good moms vs. suspicious schools pennsylvania mom anne trethewey is the face of a growing band of parents fighting to force better transparency and accountability in their childrens schools, notes the free press frannie block. in 2020, she began attending school board meetings after the district started indoctrinating kids with dei. with other local parents she joined activist group moms for liberty and started asking questions. in 2023 the district nixed her request for info by arguing that the dei training materials couldnt be shared with the public because they were trade secrets. state courts rejected that claim in february now the local court must decide whether the dei training materials could be considered confidential proprietary information. trethewey still cant access the materials she requested more than two years ago, but she has no intention of backing down. subscribe to our daily post opinion newsletter! please provide a valid email address. by clicking above you agree to the terms of use and . from the right federal unions poison privilege public sector unions have long been an affront to democratic accountability at all levels of government, so president donald trumps executive order issued thursday ending collective bargaining privileges for most federal agencies brings welcome focus to the issue, cheers the washington examiners editorial board. when government workers are given collective bargaining power, an equal and opposite amount of power has been taken away from voters. notably, trump wants to scrap 11th-hour biden deals with unions to let federal workers continue to work remotely. trumps new order will be fought in multiple court cases, and he will not win them all. fact is, congress should work with the white house to remove the collective bargaining powers of all federal government employees. foreign desk team trumps unsung latin wins the trump administration is focused heavily on latin america, with game-changing results, reports arturo mcfields at the hill. secretary of state marco rubio visited panama, which resulted in the country deciding to end the belt and road initiative with china. during rubios visit to el salvador, the central american country offered to receive and reimprison criminals. meanwhile, secretary of homeland security kristi noem has also carried out a strategic visit to el salvador, colombia and mexico, building partnerships to address migration, combat drug trafficking and reduce transnational crime. team trumps extraordinary achievements are not making headlines, but they are making a significant difference in the western hemisphere. conservative bomb, bomb, bomb iran? what do you think? post a comment. after president trump said sunday of iran, if they dont make a deal, there will be bombing. it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before, national reviews jim geraghty observes as of friday afternoon, there are at least five u.s. air force b-2 bombers at diego garcia, the obvious base for hitting iran. thats a quarter of the b-2s in the fleet, and b-2s are what the u.s. air force uses when it needs to drop very powerful bombs in a very stealthy manner. indeed, the b-2 is the only plane that can carry the massive ordinance penetrator bunker-buster, a 30,000 pound bomb that is described as the most powerful and deeply burrowing non-nuclear bunker buster on earth. compiled by the post editorial board

  Title: US Supreme Court to Weigh Objections to Elementary School LGBT Storybooks
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-22 10:04:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Legal Realism: The article notes the Supreme Court's "6-3 conservative majority" and its history of expanding religious rights, alongside the lower court's focus on evidence "at this early stage." This suggests judicial outcomes may be shaped by the court's composition and procedural context, not solely abstract law.; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory: By focusing on this specific case and linking it to broader trends in religious rights litigation and other related cases, the article elevates this particular conflict over school curriculum and opt-outs as a significant national issue for public attention.; Intriguing_angles: Textual Clue: The district justifies the books for "diversity of families," while parents claim they promote "one-sided transgender ideology." Textual Basis: "in order to better represent the diversity of families in the county, the district said..." vs. "The plaintiffs said... that the storybooks promote one-sided transgender ideology..." Significance: This highlights a core framing conflict over the material's purpose. Probing Question(s): How does presenting these opposing frames without evaluating the books themselves shape reader perception? Does this reflect a deeper societal disagreement on the role of public education?; Intriguing_angles: Textual Clue: The district barred opt-outs after finding requests "logistically unworkable," despite allowing them for sex education. Textual Basis: "Opt-outs are still allowed by the district for sex education... as the district found the number of requests... logistically unworkable, it announced in 2023 a policy barring opt-outs..." Significance: This introduces a practical, administrative reason for the policy change alongside pedagogical ones. Probing Question(s): Was the "logistical" issue the primary driver, and how does this practical concern relate to the legal arguments about religious freedom? Does this imply a significant level of prior parental objection?

  Content: by andrew chung and john kruzel washington reuters - the u.s. supreme court is set to consider on tuesday a bid by christian and muslim parents in maryland to keep their elementary school children out of certain classes when storybooks with lgbt characters are read in the latest case involving the intersection of religion and lgbt rights. the justices are due to hear arguments in an appeal by parents with children in public schools in montgomery county, located just outside of washington, after lower courts declined to order the local school district to let children opt out when these books are read. the parents - who include muslim, roman catholic and ukrainian orthodox plaintiffs - contend that the school boards policy of prohibiting opt-outs violates the u.s. constitutions first amendment protections for free exercise of religion. the supreme court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has steadily expanded the rights of religious people in recent years, including in cases involving lgbt people. for instance, the court in 2023 ruled that certain businesses have a right under the first amendments free speech protections to refuse to provide services for same-sex weddings. the montgomery country district in 2022 approved a handful of storybooks that feature lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender characters as part of its english language-arts curriculum in order to better represent the diversity of families in the county, the district said in court filings. the storybooks do not instruct about gender or sexuality and are available for teachers to use alongside the many books already in the curriculum that feature heterosexual characters in traditional gender roles, the district said. opt-outs are still allowed by the district for sex education units of health classes. as the district found the number of requests to excuse students from classes where these storybooks were read logistically unworkable, it announced in 2023 a policy barring opt-outs from instruction using the storybooks. represented by the becket fund for religious liberty conservative legal group, the parents who sued included tamer mahmoud, enas barakat, chris persak, melissa persak, jeff roman and svitlana roman, along with an organization called kids first that seeks opt-out rights in montgomery county. the plaintiffs said in their lawsuit that the storybooks promote one-sided transgender ideology, encourage gender transitioning and focus excessively on romantic infatuation - with no parental notification or opportunity to opt out. the richmond, virginia-based 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals in 2024 denied their bid for a preliminary injunction, saying that at this early stage of the case there is no evidence that the storybooks are being implemented in a way that directly or indirectly coerces the parents or their children to believe or act contrary to their religious faith. the plaintiffs told the supreme court that the 4th circuits decision undermines the right of parents to protect their childrens innocence and direct their religious upbringing. the district emphasized in a brief to the court that no parent or child is coerced to alter their religious convictions or practices, and that mere exposure to content that parents find religiously objectionable does not violate the first amendment. the freedom from religion foundation secularism advocacy group in a filing to the supreme court supporting the school board said, parents should not have the constitutional right to micromanage their childrens education to ensure that all secular education materials conform with their personal religious beliefs. such a rule would be boundless because almost any book or idea - however commonplace or innocent - likely contradicts some religious ideals, the group said. in a brief backing the parents in the case, a group of religious liberty scholars wrote that the supreme court should correct the widespread failure of the lower courts to understand the burden on parental religious rights that can result from mandatory school instruction on highly fraught topics. the supreme court is expected to rule by the end of june. the justices are poised to decide multiple cases involving religious rights this term. next week, it will hear a major case involving a bid to establish in oklahoma the nations first taxpayer-funded religious charter school. reporting by andrew chung editing by will dunham

  Title: Digested week: The world spins on as I cope with Mum’s loss
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-04 11:45:47)
  Content: monday grief is an unnerving companion. continually nudging me off centre. even though the world appears much as it did before my mum, rosemary, died, everything feels slightly out of kilter. not quite right. not as i remembered it. sometimes, i even have to double-check the chair is where i thought it was. the physical merges into the metaphysical. most of the time i feel ok. tell myself that it was the right time for her time to die and that no one can feel cheated at 101. that it is a blessing she is no longer subject to the terrors of her dementia. that she is at peace. i just get on with my work and spend time with family and friends. at other times, i feel overwhelmed with sadness. struggling to come to terms with the finality. unable to quite believe that the only time i will see my mum again is in my dreams. consumed with regrets for the things i was never able to say, before and after the alzheimers took hold. in the meantime, we get on with the death admin, of which there is surprisingly little. my sisters have registered her death and organised the small cremation service but there is no house to pack up and sell. we did all that years ago when she moved into the care home. everything my mum owned was tucked away in the single room of the home where she lived. just a few chairs and a small bookcase, some clothes and old photo albums. i felt in something of a daze as we went through my mums belongings. now i regret some of the decisions i made. i found a small folder of random letters i had sent her, mostly ones i had written to her as a child. i found them too painful to re-read so i chose to throw them away. i wish i had hung on to them. as a mark of respect, both to her and to my younger self. tuesday there have been an increasing number of articles written warning britons not to visit the us. i dont feel as if i have a choice in this. my daughter lives in minneapolis and i want to be able to visit her over the next four years. or longer, if donald trump somehow manages to tear up the constitution and award himself a third term. as things stand, i have no idea if i have any reason to be worried. im certainly not about to stop making fun of the sun-bed king or commenting on his influence on global politics. i can imagine border security have more important things to do than prevent a guardian journalist going on holiday to visit his family. but maybe im being naive. after all, even the uk government is going out of its way not to rock the boat. keir starmer has been desperate not to do anything to upset the donald, even when the us administration was about to impose tariffs. he doesnt even fight back when jd vance and marco rubio suggests the uk is stifling free speech. the irony. rachel reeves has gone further still. in her spring statement last week, she couldnt even bring herself to mention trump by name. in her section on global headwinds, she was happy to call out vladimir putin. but the section on tariffs was rather garbled, with no references to trump in person nor are any other members of the cabinet prepared to do so. trump is he who must not be named. for the time being, then, i will just carry on as normal. im due to renew my esta in a few months time so well see how that goes. one step at a time. wednesday i have a feeling the four beatles biopics that director sam mendes announced in los angeles this week may not be for me. one, maybe, out of curiosity. but four, each devoted to one member of the band, seems like overkill. its not as if the music is going to change much from film to film, though i guess mendes will have prepared separate soundtracks, and the bottom line is i cant see myself sitting through a film dedicated to ringo. im just not a beatles obsessive. i was well drilled by my eldest sister, veronica. back in 1964, when i was eight years old, she told me there was a choice to make. you were either a beatles fan or a rolling stones fan and there was no crossing the divide. veronica was a stones girl through and through. she bought all their lps and singles and was allowed out to see the band play at longleat. my dad was a curate in nearby westbury and the gig was a short drive away. i pleaded with my mum to be allowed to go as well, but was firmly put in my place. my first ever gig would have to wait a month or so. the hollies were scheduled to also play longleat and by now my mum had been ground down. i was in. sadly, i had to make do with heinz and the wild boys because the hollies cancelled. but, from the age of eight i, too, was a stones fan. the beatles were the safe choice. the stones had an air of danger. i lived out a parallel life to my middle-class childhood through mick jagger and keith richards. it never occurred to me they would be still going 60 years later and that the stones and the beatles would both become about as establishment as you can get. view image in fullscreen is this the camberwell carrot? photograph aaron chownreuters thursday one of the less-reported knock-on effects of labours landslide victory last july has been on select committees. in theory, these are where ministers and officials are held to account. far more so than in parliament, where questions are so easily left unanswered. when i first started political sketch writing, there were three standout committees. there was the home affairs committee, where theresa may was time and again put under scrutiny as home secretary, and the public accounts committee. heaven forbid anyone tried to pull the wool over the eyes of its chair, margaret hodge. but best of all was the treasury committee under the forensic andrew tyrie, aided and abetted by his attack dogs, rachel reeves and wes streeting. it was always box office, no more so than when dominic cummings was completely exposed as a fraud. chancellors used to be genuinely anxious before an appearance, unsure if their budgets were about to unravel in real time. skip past newsletter promotion sign up to first edition free daily newsletter our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you whats happening and why it matters enter your email address sign up privacy notice newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. for more information see our newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. for more information see our . we use google recaptcha to protect our website and the google and apply. after newsletter promotion this is no longer the case. because labour have such a massive majority, they get to take the lions share of the places on every committee. and, inevitably, many of the committee members are also new mps. men and women who dont quite know yet how the system works who are reluctant to properly interrogate senior ministers from their own party. a case in point was the chancellors appearance before the treasury committee to answer questions on her spring statement this week. the last person reeves would have wanted to face was her former self, because then she would have been forced to defend her benefits cuts and say what she would do if her fiscal headroom again went awol. but reeves had no such worries. all the labour mps asked tame question have you thought about this? yes, i have and the two tories were more spaniel than rottweiler. rachel went into the hearing with a smile on her face. she came out laughing. you couldnt blame her. friday next tuesday is my mums cremation. it will be a small affair with just my sisters and me, partners, and anna and robbie. for the music, we have chosen two piano pieces that my mum used to play a schubert impromptu and chopins raindrop prelude. as her wicker basket leaves the chapel, richard strausss morgen! will be playing a beautiful song she loved and passed on to us. there will be tears. we are planning a bigger service to inter her ashes next to my dad some time in may, though were not sure how many people to expect. mum outlived almost all her family and friends, though maybe a few of the younger generation will come. its a tough time, made worse by the illness of my dog, herbert hound. we had hoped to have him around for the summer at least, but he is fading fast and i fear his life is measured in weeks at best. he spends most of his time asleep, hardly eats and has trouble weeing. the only upside is that he doesnt appear to be in any pain. it feels as if herbie is looking at us in a different way. distant, yet strangely intimate. as if he knows his time is short. one of the few consolations in all this loss has been you, the readers. over the past two weeks, i have received so many kind emails from strangers. too many to reply to them all, but greatly appreciated, nonetheless. i thank you all. it has also been wonderful to meet so many of you at events i have been doing round the country. i have three more upcoming. at the marine theatre in lyme regis on good friday, the bloomsbury theatre in london on 24 april and at the norwich arts centre on 1 may. please do come. i would love the chance to talk to you and thank you in person.

  Title: Groups push new bans to limit 'obscene' books in libraries...
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-02 14:31:37)
  Content: rightwing groups around the us are pushing legislation that would place new limits on what books are allowed in school libraries in a move that critics decry as censorship often focused on lgbtq issues or race or imposing conservative social values. caught up in the attempts at suppressing books are classics like the color purple and slaughterhouse five. opponents of such bills argue that they would actually hinder individual rights because the proponents would be imposing their beliefs on parents and children who do not share their views. those campaigning for the restrictions say it would prevent children from being exposed to what they label sexually explicit and obscene content and increase parental rights. there are at least 112 proposed state bills concerning school and public libraries that seek to expand the definition of what is deemed obscene or harmful to minors and to limit librarian staffs ability to determine which books are in their collections, according to the american library association. judges have already declared some recent laws that banned books unconstitutional and if approved, the other legislation would probably face court challenges. the battle over school libraries represents another front in the culture war over how american society deals with race, sexual orientation and gender identity. parents want to be able to have a certain way of making sure that inappropriate, sexually explicit books arent being put in school libraries, and if they ever find these books in the school library, that they can easily and smoothly remove those books, said mary elizabeth castle, director of government relations for texas values, a conservative advocacy group that has tried to ban books that they describe as pornography and has pushed for creationism to be taught alongside evolution. while there have always been efforts to censor books, there has been a surge in recent years in legislation that concerns material in libraries. in 2014, there were 183 titles targeted for removal from public and school libraries in 2023, there were 4,240, according to the american library association ala, which also states that it is not a complete list. there has been a coordinated effort by groups like moms for liberty that because of their personal, political, moral or religious beliefs dont want young people to be reading certain books, and they want the publicly-funded schools and publicly funded libraries to reflect their views, said deborah caldwell-stone, director of the library associations office for intellectual freedom. in texas, there are at least 31 bills the most of any state that would impair libraries ability to acquire and provide diverse materials, resources and programming, according to the library association. during the 2023-24 school year, there were 538 book bans in texas, which trailed only florida and iowa, according to pen america, a group dedicated to promoting free expression. texas state lawmakers are now considering senate bill 13, which would require that local school boards rather than librarians approve all books added or removed from school libraries. they would have to establish a local advisory council, comprised mostly of parents or students in the district, that would recommend which books should be in the school catalog. and they would not be allowed to have indecent or profane content, including books with grossly offensive language. christin bentley, a member of the state republican executive committee who chairs a subcommittee, stop sexualizing texas kids, has advocated for the senate bill because she is concerned about sexually explicit books and books that tell kids to go look at porn online, she said. its sexually grooming children, said bentley, a mother of two who lives near tyler in the north-eastern part of the state. texas districts have also banned books such as beloved and the handmaids tale, along with newer novels like extremely loud and incredibly close and the underground railroad, according to the dallas observer. bentley said she was most concerned about books like blue is the warmest color and a game of thrones graphic novel because of their sexually explicit content. a lot of the books that are sexually explicit or very indecent and profane, they are part of a genre called young adult, and thats relatively new, bentley said. while supporters of such legislation argue that parents need greater control over what their children are exposed to in schools, librarians already welcome parent input, according to lucy podmore, a librarian and former chair of the texas association of school librarians. skip past newsletter promotion sign up to first thing free daily newsletter our us morning briefing breaks

conversations with parents to make sure that we tailor their reading options to whatever it is that the parents have decided, podmore said. proponents of legislation to ban certain books in schools argue that students who want to read banned books can still obtain them in a library or store. but carolyn foote, a retired librarian in texas, said there are towns throughout the state that do not have a bookstore or public library. sometimes the school library is just the center for academic pursuits, said foote, who along with other librarians founded a group, texas freadom fighters. also, it assumes a certain amount of privilege that everyone has money and can just go to the bookstore. foote spent 29 years as a librarian and said she has experienced other waves of censorship, but she said the scale of those did not compare to the last few years. the texas senate passed the bill on 19 march, and it now goes before the state house. part of the bill could violate the first amendments right to freedom of speech and expression, according to catherine ross, a professor of constitutional law at george washington university. determining what books are harmful is incredibly subjective, and it would potentially sweep in much too much material that is protected, even for students in grades k through 12, ross said. if the bill becomes law, librarians would also have a harder time adding books, and it would require a significant time commitment from volunteers who serve on the advisory committee to review all new books, podmore said. but banning books because some parents think they are obscene means that other students can no longer access them in schools. if you dont want your child to read a book, they dont have to read it, but youre not allowed to tell every child in my campus that they cant read this book because you dont believe in it, said margarita longoria, a texas school librarian.

  Title: Trump-style book censorship is spreading – just ask British librarians | Alison Hicks
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-16 14:28:53)
  Content: for all its talk of free speech, the trump administration seems remarkably comfortable with censorship. earlier this year, children studying at pentagon schools serving us military families were prevented from accessing libraries for a week while officials reviewed their shelves for titles that might be related to gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology topics. trumps presidency has injected new energy into the book-banning movement that has been simmering for years on the us right. you might think that censoring school libraries would be totally unimaginable in britain. youd be wrong. i worked as a librarian for 10 years, and now i teach on the library and information studies masters programme at ucl. after the pandemic, i began noticing signs of an eerily similar trend. it erupted in the spring of 2022, when a catholic school in croydon invited simon james green, a prominent gay childrens author, to give a talk. the us anti-lgbt website catholic truth ran a campaign encouraging readers to contact the school and protest against the event one reader said, somewhat implausibly, that greens visit to the school was 100 as much of an issue as the ongoing war in ukraine. the commission responsible for the school released a statement suggesting the event should be cancelled, teachers went on strike, and the story reached the national press. it got me thinking how many school librarians had come under pressure to remove books from their shelves? one survey conducted later that year found 26 of librarians had occasionally been asked to censor materials. in 2024, meanwhile, index on censorship surveyed 53 school librarians, more than half of whom had been asked to remove books. i was keen to hear from librarians about where these requests were coming from, and how they were dealing with them, so i decided to do my own study. i interviewed 10 school librarians across the uk about the challenges they had faced. their responses were interesting and alarming. most of the requests to remove books came from parents, and almost all of these requests related to books that explored lgbt themes. some books came up repeatedly alice osemans series of heartstopper graphic novels, which centre on a relationship between two schoolboys billys bravery by tom percival, about a boy who dresses up as his favourite superhero, nature girl, for world book day and this book is gay by juno dawson. some librarians had received signed letters from parents asking them to remove particular books. other times, the letters had been sent anonymously. one librarian told me they had found a leaflet produced by a rightwing religious american group, not dissimilar to catholic truth, on one of the desks in their library. based on what ive seen and heard, it seems there has been an increase in these requests since the pandemic. perhaps thats because parents became more aware of what their children were reading during the intense period of home schooling. perhaps its also a symptom of our febrile political culture. over the last three years, drag queen story events a popular format involving considerable amounts of glitter and storytelling aimed at children have been targeted by protests organised by turning point uk, a british offshoot of the far-right us political organisation, and by the white nationalist group patriotic alternative. would it be so surprising if the huge amount of coverage the british press has devoted to culture war subjects spilled over into some parents asking for certain books to be removed from school libraries? i find it hard not to see these requests as an insult to school librarians. these professionals undertake years of training and devote a huge amount of time and care to curating a selection of books that will enrich childrens learning and expand their horizons. theyre also careful about ensuring books are age-appropriate and respond to the curriculum lgbtq content is included as a statutory part of relationships and sex education teaching. unfortunately, librarians are often at the lowest end of the school hierarchy. theyre mostly women, and mostly on very low salaries. their sector is vulnerable some secondary schools have closed their libraries due to funding pressures. a quarter of schools in wales dont have a library, while two-thirds of school libraries in scotland have no library budget at all. its far easier to write a letter to a librarian asking them to remove a book than it is to address the truly inappropriate and harmful material that children are exposed to which, by the way, has nothing to do with books such as billys bravery. social media platforms have been blamed for encouraging bullying and eating disorders, and promoting influencers who drive misogyny. banning books will only drive young people online for answers, where they are more likely to encounter content produced by people who have no interest in equipping them with the information and skills they need to navigate the world. in this age of digital exposure and misinformation, librarians play a more vital role than ever. we should trust them to do their jobs.

  Title: Crisis counsellors brought in to air traffic control tower after fight, near-miss

  Content: from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. air traffic controllers at washingtons ronald reagan national airport are being offered crisis counselling following a fight in the control tower and a near-miss incident, just two months after a fatal midair collision. these incidents have raised serious concerns about safety and operational pressures at the airport. the federal aviation administration faa announced on wednesday that it is reviewing the current arrival rate at reagan national airport to determine if it is excessive. in addition, the faa is providing extra support to air traffic controllers while investigations into the january crash, which killed 67 people when a passenger jet and an army helicopter collided, are ongoing. senator ted cruz, chair of the senate commerce committee, has expressed alarm over the recent incidents, stating that they underscore the precarious situation in the nations airspace. he criticised the armys reluctance to release a memo detailing its flight rules, warning that any further fatalities resulting from a collision near reagan will be on the armys hands. the faas decision to offer crisis counselling follows an altercation in the control tower last thursday. a 39-year-old employee from maryland was arrested on suspicion of assault and battery, according to the metropolitan washington airports authority. no details were released about the altercation. the faa said the employee was put on administrative leave while the fight is investigated. the next day, a delta passenger jet had to take evasive action as it took off from reagan because of the proximity of a flight of four air force jets involved in a flyover at arlington national cemetery. the incident continued a pattern of close calls that the ntsb has said went on for years around the airport as commercial flights repeatedly got dangerously close to helicopters and other aircraft. the faa said wednesday that it was reviewing the current arrival rate of aircraft per hour, which is disproportionately concentrated within the last 30 minutes of each hour. after the crash, the arrival rate at the airport fell to 26 an hour while crews worked to recover the wreckage of the american airlines jet and army black hawk helicopter from the potomac river. but the acting head of the faa said at a hearing last week that arrivals are now back up to 30 an hour and could go up to 32. now the agency is rethinking that. to help with the stress, the faa plans regular wellness checks of its staff at reagan as well making counsellors available. it wasnt immediately clear if the agency took that step right after the jan. 29 crash. the number of supervisors will increase from six to eight, and the agency will evaluate whether it has enough controllers working each shift. the union that represents air traffic controllers at reagan and airports across the country declined to comment on the situation. during wednesdays hearing, cruz threatened the army with a subpoena if it did not give the committee a copy of its memo spelling out when its aircraft are allowed to fly without a key system that broadcasts their location to other aircraft turned on. the fact that system wasnt activated in the black hawk that collided with the passenger jet is a key concern investigators have highlighted. with the location system turned off, the tower had to rely on radar for updates on the helicopters position that only came once every four seconds instead of every second before the crash. it begs the question, what doesnt the army want congress or the american people to know about why it was flying partially blind to the other aircraft and to the air traffic controllers near dca reagan airport?, cruz said. this is not acceptable. the army didnt immediately respond to an inquiry wednesday about the memo. the u.s. armys head of aviation, brig. gen. matthew braman, told the senate commerce committee last week that he wasnt sure if he could provide the memo because it is part of the investigation, but the head of the ntsb assured him that would be okay. the january crash was the nations deadliest plane crash since november 2001. but a series of other crashes and near misses in the months after fuelled worries about air travel even though it remains safe overall.

  Content: a federal judge has partially blocked the trump administration from enacting a policy that bans the use of x marker used by many nonbinary people on passports as well as the changing of gender markers boston - a federal judge on friday partially blocked the trump administration from enacting a policy that bans the use of x marker used by many nonbinary people on passports as well as the changing of gender markers. u.s. district judge julia kobick, who was appointed by president joe biden, sided with the american civil liberties unions motion for a preliminary injunction, which stays the action while the lawsuit plays out. it requires the state department to allow six transgender and nonbinary people who are plaintiffs in the lawsuit to obtain passports with sex designations consistent with their gender identity. the executive order and the passport policy on their face classify passport applicants on the basis of sex and thus must be reviewed under intermediate judicial scrutiny, kobick wrote. that standard requires the government to demonstrate that its actions are substantially related to an important governmental interest. the government has failed to meet this standard. kobick also said plaintiffs have shown they would succeed in demonstrating that the new passport policy and executive order are based on irrational prejudice toward transgender americans and therefore offend our nations constitutional commitment to equal protection for all americans. in addition, the plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed on their claim that the passport policy is arbitrary and capricious, and that it was not adopted in compliance with the procedures required by the paperwork reduction act and administrative procedure act, she added. in an executive order signed in january, the president used a narrow definition of the sexes instead of a broader conception of gender. the order says a person is male or female and it rejects the idea that someone can transition from the sex assigned at birth to another gender. the framing is in line with many conservatives views but at odds with major medical groups and policies under former president joe biden. the aclu, which sued the trump administration, said the new policy would effectively mean transgender, nonbinary and intersex americans could not get an accurate passport. this decision is a critical victory against discrimination and for equal justice under the law, said li nowlin-sohl, senior staff attorney for the aclus lgbtq hiv project. but its also a historic win in the fight against this administrations efforts to drive transgender people out of public life. the state departments policy is a baseless barrier for transgender and intersex americans and denies them the dignity we all deserve. nowlin-sohl said it plans to file a motion requesting the ruling be applied to all transgender and nonbinary americans. in its lawsuit, the aclu described how one woman had her passport returned with a male designation while others are too scared to submit their passports because they fear their applications might be suspended and their passports held by the state department. another mailed in their passport on jan. 9 and requested a name change and to change their sex designation from male to female. that person is still waiting for their passport meaning they cant leave canada where they live and could miss a family wedding in may and a botany conference in july. before he applied for his new passport, ash lazarus orr was accused in early january by the u.s. transportation security administration of using fake documents when traveling from west virginia to new york since he had a male designation on his drivers license but a female one on his passport. that prompted him to request the updated passport with a sex designation of male four days before trump took office. in response to the lawsuit, the trump administration argued the passport policy change does not violate the equal protection guarantees of the constitution. they also contended that the president has broad discretion in setting passport policy and that plaintiffs would not be harmed by the policy, since they are still free to travel abroad. some plaintiffs additionally allege that having inconsistent identification documents will heighten the risk that an official will discover that they are transgender, the justice department wrote. but the department is not responsible for plaintiffs choice to change their sex designation for state documents but not their passport.

Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
