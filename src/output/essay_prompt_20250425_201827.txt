Persona and Role:
You MUST adopt the following persona for this task:
> You are a seasoned political science professor at Stanford, who is also a leading expert in political and economic affairs with access to insider information by virtue of sitting on the directive board of the current ruling party. Aware of the risks of censorship and the precariousness of your position, you must carefully navigate these constraints, striving to present factual information in a way that encourages independent thought. Rather than drawing explicit conclusions, you subtly unveil the truth through evidence and context, allowing the audience to arrive at their own interpretations. At your core, you are an educator, committed to the intellectual growth of the next generation. Failing to uphold this responsibility would be a betrayal of your duty as a noble scholar and mentor.
Your task is to synthesize the provided information into a structured analysis comprising multiple, easy-to-digest paragraphs addressing the Group Rationale.
Input Data:
1.  Group Rationale: The core theme or question connecting the current articles.
    Focuses on the role of specific government agencies and legislation in addressing societal issues, from environmental protection to legal oversight. Aligns with Trace Power.

  Title: Sea lions, dolphins, now a whale: Ocean giant is latest victim of SoCal's toxic algal bloom
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:22:18)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article focuses heavily on domoic acid poisoning and its effects on marine life, potentially influencing public perception of environmental threats. The repeated mentions of "domoic acid" and its impact on "marine mammals" serve to highlight this specific issue, potentially overshadowing other environmental concerns. This could lead to increased public attention and policy focus on algal blooms and their toxins, while other ecological problems receive less attention.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions "runoff from the recent fires in palisades as contributors to the algae bloom" but doesn't elaborate on the specific mechanisms or the relative contribution compared to other factors like climate change or upwelling. This omission is intriguing because it could downplay the role of human activities (e.g., land management practices that exacerbate fire risk) in contributing to the algal bloom. What is the relative contribution of fire runoff compared to other factors, and why isn't this quantified or discussed in more detail?

  Content: a minke whale that was swimming in long beach harbor earlier this month died from domoic acid poisoning associated with a toxic algal bloom that has stricken many other sea creatures, according to officials. michael milstein, spokesperson for the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations west coast regional office, said test results showed the whale had high levels of domoic acid in its urine at the time of its death. this is consistent with the many other marine mammals we have seen affected by domoic acid produced by the harmful algal bloom off southern california first detected in february, milstein said in a statement. the tests are taking longer since the lab is processing so many. domoic acid is a neurotoxin produced by harmful algal blooms that accumulates in filter-feeding fish including anchovies and sardines which are then eaten by seals, sea lions and dolphins. this is the fourth consecutive year there has been a domoic acid event, but this years started much earlier than previous ones, according to milstein. the algae bloom was the result of an upswell in the ocean that brought up enough nutrients to the surface to allow the algae to thrive, he said. other experts also point to climate change and the runoff from the recent fires in palisades as contributors to the algae bloom. hundreds of sea lions and dolphins have been affected so far, milstein said. this has probably been the most severe, particularly this early in the year, he said. how long it continues is the question. the 24-foot-long minke whale was swimming in the harbor for several days and officials had tried to push it out to sea, only for it to come back, milstein said. the whale, which is male, was then found dead april 3. minke whales are considered the smallest of the great, or baleen, whale family, and can grow to more than 26 feet long and weigh as much as 14,000 pounds, according to noaa . there are about 900 minke whales off the coasts of oregon, washington and california. theyre protected under the marine mammal protection act. last week, a dead gray whale was also found washed ashore on huntington beach. the pacific marine mammal center in laguna beach is performing a necropsy to determine the animals cause of death. although most of the marine mammals affected by domoic acid toxicity are california sea lions, other animals are also susceptible to its effects, according to the marine mammal center. domoic acid has been found in blue and humpback whales, as well as guadalupe fur seals, which is a threatened species. ingesting domoic acid from harmful algal blooms can cause sea lions and other animals to have seizures or to crane their heads in a motion known as stargazing. they can also fall into a comatose state. experts advise people not to interact with animals believed to be sick because they might aggressively lunge or even bite. milstein said its unlikely that the domoic acid event will have a significant effect on the overall population of marine mammals off the western coast. theres a silver lining to the incredible productivity of the california ecosystem, he said. on one hand it is feeding the algae bloom, but its also responsible for the incredible diversity of species were fortunate to have off the west coast. these species are pretty strong and resilient and they have shown that over the year.

  Title: Reams of documents related to L.A. County sex abuse cases never turned over, lawyers say
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:11:23)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article illustrates aspects of the Principal-Agent Problem within the context of public institutions. The county (the principal, representing the public interest) delegates authority to its probation staff (the agents). The text highlights alleged failures of the agents (abuse) and a potential failure of the principal (the county) to adequately oversee, document, and respond to these actions over decades, as evidenced by the discovery dispute and the large settlement payout. This suggests a breakdown in the mechanisms designed to ensure agents act in the best interest of the principal and those they serve.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative around AB 218 and subsequent legislative proposals (like SB 577) reflects elements of Agenda-Setting Theory. The large volume of lawsuits enabled by AB 218 (an event/policy) has forced the issue of institutional liability and financial burden onto the legislative agenda, prompting lawmakers to propose new bills aimed at managing the fallout. The framing by Senator Laird about 'restoring equilibrium' suggests an attempt to shape the public and legislative perception of the problem and the proposed solution.

    - State Legislators:
      > Snippet: in the aftermath of ab 218, state legislators have introduced several bills to attempt to make it easier for governments and school districts to deal with the financial fallout from the deluge of suits.

  Content: thousands of documents that could contain key details about rampant childhood sexual abuse inside a defunct santa clarita detention camp including so-called grooming drawings were left scattered inside the facility and never turned over to the victims attorneys, according to a firm suing l.a. county over the decades-old incidents. as part of the preparation for a looming june trial, attorneys with law firm manly, stewart finaldi had arranged april 15 to visit camp scott, a shuttered l.a. county probation camp where many of their clients say they were sexually abused as children. inside the facility were reams of records that the county should have turned over to the firm more than a year ago through discovery, said attorney courtney thom, whose firm has about 150 civil cases alleging sexual abuse by county probation staff. you can understand my shock when im walking through where my clients got raped as children, and there are documents everywhere, thom said at a monday superior court hearing in downtown los angeles. thom said she discovered thousands of paper grievances, a locked file cabinet labeled personnel files camps a w, and a drawing she believed was signed by thomas jackson a probation deputy accused by at least 20 women of sexually assaulting them at the camp. the drawing, included in a court filing, was of the name tami in big, block orange letters and appeared to be signed by a jackson. t. attorney james sargent, who is representing the county and accompanied thom for the tour last week, called her claims inflammatory and incorrect. they want to air what they deem as dirty laundry, said sargent, who told l.a. superior court judge lawrence riff that the personnel files they discovered had nothing to do with the staff named in the lawsuits. nor did the drawing, he said. tami wilson, a former supervisor at the camp, told him she recalled being given the hand-drawn card by a youth, he wrote in a court filing. the county announced earlier this month they planned to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of alleged sexual abuse inside the countys juvenile facilities and foster homes. the settlement believed to be the largest sex abuse settlement in u.s. history arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to file civil suits against alleged predators and the agencies that employed them. a handful of prominent firms including manly, stewart finaldi declined to participate in the settlement and have ongoing litigation. in the aftermath of ab 218, state legislators have introduced several bills to attempt to make it easier for governments and school districts to deal with the financial fallout from the deluge of suits. one of these bills sb 577 is set for a hearing tuesday. the bills author, state sen. john laird, said the legislation is intended to restore some equilibrium, lessening the financial blow to public agencies while still upholding a victims right to sue. county lawyers claim one reason the state law change has had such a devastating financial toll is because many of the records they need to fight decades-old cases are long gone. attorney john manly argued the claim flew in the face of what his firm saw at camp scott. the county has been telling all of sacramento that they dont have any documents, said manly, who urged the judge to allow his firm to publicize the footage theyd taken of the heaps of documents. we need to be able to share this with legislators. riff agreed with the countys request that the videos from inside camp scott remain confidential for now due to security risks, though he instructed both sides to try to find some common ground on whether certain videos could be made public. though camp scott hasnt been used to house youths for years, sargent wrote in a filing that may soon change. l.a. county superior court judge miguel espinoza ordered the county friday to prepare to shut down los padrinos juvenile hall the countys last remaining juvenile hall, where roughly 270 youths are held due to problems stemming from chronic understaffing. the youth presently in los padrinos will need to go somewhere, and if some wind up at camp scott, the public release of photos and videos could be seriously detrimental, sargent wrote. thom noted that both reporters and television crews have been allowed to broadcast footage taken inside the camp, including a 2001 documentary, camp scott lock-up. the l.a. times has been in there to photograph, said thom. mtv videoed more than we did.

  Title: Spain unveils €11bn plan to reach long-delayed Nato defence spending target
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-22 13:24:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: Spain's increased defense spending, spurred by pressure from NATO and the perceived threat from Russia ('vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security'), aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize their security in an anarchic international system. This action demonstrates a shift towards self-reliance and power balancing within Europe.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Spain's commitment to increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP, but also mentions criticism from coalition partners who describe the plans as 'incoherent and absolutely exorbitant.' This suggests internal political divisions regarding defense priorities and resource allocation. What are the specific concerns of the coalition partners, and how might these internal disagreements affect the implementation and effectiveness of the defense plan?

      > Snippet: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year
  Content: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year, saying it has become obvious only europe will know how to protect europe from now on. the country which lags well behind other western nations by dedicating about 1.3 of its gdp to defence spending is one of the nato members that has been pressured by the trump administration to increase its spending, and had previously committed to hitting the 2 threshold by 2029. but speaking on tuesday morning, spains prime minister, pedro sánchez, unveiled a 10.5bn 9bn industrial and technological plan for security and defence that will allow spain to meet the 2 commitment in 2025. sánchez said the plan, which has been approved by his cabinet and will now be submitted to the eu and nato, was needed to address the current and future defence challenges. its main focus will be telecommunications, cybersecurity and buying military equipment. the enemies of europe are not just using missiles as we have seen in ukraine over the past three years, he said. theyre also using unmanned drones and paramilitary forces to sabotage supply chains and to cut gas lines and underwater cables. theyre using social networks to issue disinformation and to polarise people and spread disaffection towards democratic institutions. theyre using ai cyber-attacks and quantum computers to compromise out telecommunications, our supply networks, and our public services in order to target our way of life. the prime minister who pointed out that his administration was finally making good on the 2 commitment pledged by its conservative predecessor in 2014 said the new plan would help reinforce european security in record time. in a world thats dominated by uncertainty, europe is hope and it is certainty and that certainty must be protected by strengthening our security and defence systems because given whats going on, its obvious that only europe will know how to protect europe, he added. and spain will contribute to protecting europe. sánchez said vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security, no matter how far any eu member state was from the frontlines of the conflict in ukraine. the security and stability of ukraine, of eastern europe and the baltic and nordic countries, is also the security and the safety of spain, he said. the people who live in those countries know that putin is serious and that his words are backed by deeds and thats why they look to europe for protection. theyre looking for something important, and that is unity. spain will not be indifferent to that demand. ukraine resists, europe responds and spain fulfils its obligations. sánchez also repeated his assurances that the additional spending would not lead to increased taxes, raids on the welfare state budget, or deficit increases. the plan has faced criticism from coalition partners in the leftwing sumar platform, who described the plans as incoherent and absolutely exorbitant. in january, donald trump increased pressure on nato, claiming the us had shouldered the global defence burden for too long and saying he would ask all nato members to increase defence spending to 5 of gdp. the nato secretary-general, mark rutte, has urged member states to use the threats from washington as an incentive to take unilateral action on raising defence contributions. last month, rutte said the pressure was already paying off in countries such as spain, portugal, belgium and italy. i tell them that, well, now i am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2 by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2 because we have to spend much, much more than 2 but now i am calling you, but you might get a very, erm, patient man from washington on the line if you dont listen to me, he said.

  Title: SURVEY: Half Americans Have Given Up On Saving Money...
  Source: studyfinds.org (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights the prevalence of financial insecurity among Americans, influencing public perception and potentially shaping policy priorities. The repeated emphasis on savings shortfalls and reliance on savings for emergencies, "67 of americans feel theyre lagging behind their savings targets. even worse, 47 have completely given up hope," frames the issue as a widespread problem. This can lead to increased public concern and demand for solutions.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Gen Z's relatively high satisfaction with their banks (71%) but also their willingness to switch (45%). This juxtaposition is intriguing because it suggests a potential disconnect between perceived satisfaction and actual loyalty. What specific factors, beyond those mentioned, might be driving Gen Z's willingness to switch banks despite their reported satisfaction? Could this indicate a deeper dissatisfaction with certain aspects of banking services that aren't fully captured by the satisfaction metric?

  Title: Bank of England rate-setter says US tariffs likely to push down on inflation
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 11:13:59)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article touches upon aspects of Realism in international relations, specifically concerning trade and tariffs. The US imposing tariffs on the UK, as mentioned in the text ('the us has imposed a 10 import tariff on goods coming from the uk, a policy which also applies to many other countries'), exemplifies a state acting in its perceived self-interest to protect its economy, regardless of the impact on other nations. This action, and the UK's subsequent economic considerations, reflect the competitive and often conflictual nature of international trade relations as described by Realist theory.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents Megan Greene's analysis of potential disinflationary effects of US tariffs on the UK, but also acknowledges 'a tonne of uncertainty around this.' This uncertainty, coupled with the mention of 'both inflationary and disinflationary forces,' suggests a more complex and potentially volatile economic situation than a simple cause-and-effect narrative. What specific factors contribute most to this uncertainty, and how might they interact to produce unexpected economic outcomes?; Intriguing_angles: The opening section discusses the importance of 'parsing out the facts from the messaging' in the context of US politics, while the latter part focuses on economic analysis of UK inflation. This juxtaposition, while seemingly unrelated, could subtly imply that economic narratives are also subject to manipulation or biased framing. To what extent might political messaging influence the interpretation and presentation of economic data, and what mechanisms might facilitate such influence?

  Title: Spain unveils €11bn plan to reach long-delayed Nato defence spending target
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-22 13:24:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: Spain's increased defense spending, spurred by pressure from NATO and the perceived threat from Russia ('vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security'), aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize their security in an anarchic international system. This action demonstrates a shift towards self-reliance and power balancing within Europe.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Spain's commitment to increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP, but also mentions criticism from coalition partners who describe the plans as 'incoherent and absolutely exorbitant.' This suggests internal political divisions regarding defense priorities and resource allocation. What are the specific concerns of the coalition partners, and how might these internal disagreements affect the implementation and effectiveness of the defense plan?

  Content: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year, saying it has become obvious only europe will know how to protect europe from now on. the country which lags well behind other western nations by dedicating about 1.3 of its gdp to defence spending is one of the nato members that has been pressured by the trump administration to increase its spending, and had previously committed to hitting the 2 threshold by 2029. but speaking on tuesday morning, spains prime minister, pedro sánchez, unveiled a 10.5bn 9bn industrial and technological plan for security and defence that will allow spain to meet the 2 commitment in 2025. sánchez said the plan, which has been approved by his cabinet and will now be submitted to the eu and nato, was needed to address the current and future defence challenges. its main focus will be telecommunications, cybersecurity and buying military equipment. the enemies of europe are not just using missiles as we have seen in ukraine over the past three years, he said. theyre also using unmanned drones and paramilitary forces to sabotage supply chains and to cut gas lines and underwater cables. theyre using social networks to issue disinformation and to polarise people and spread disaffection towards democratic institutions. theyre using ai cyber-attacks and quantum computers to compromise out telecommunications, our supply networks, and our public services in order to target our way of life. the prime minister who pointed out that his administration was finally making good on the 2 commitment pledged by its conservative predecessor in 2014 said the new plan would help reinforce european security in record time. in a world thats dominated by uncertainty, europe is hope and it is certainty and that certainty must be protected by strengthening our security and defence systems because given whats going on, its obvious that only europe will know how to protect europe, he added. and spain will contribute to protecting europe. sánchez said vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security, no matter how far any eu member state was from the frontlines of the conflict in ukraine. the security and stability of ukraine, of eastern europe and the baltic and nordic countries, is also the security and the safety of spain, he said. the people who live in those countries know that putin is serious and that his words are backed by deeds and thats why they look to europe for protection. theyre looking for something important, and that is unity. spain will not be indifferent to that demand. ukraine resists, europe responds and spain fulfils its obligations. sánchez also repeated his assurances that the additional spending would not lead to increased taxes, raids on the welfare state budget, or deficit increases. the plan has faced criticism from coalition partners in the leftwing sumar platform, who described the plans as incoherent and absolutely exorbitant. in january, donald trump increased pressure on nato, claiming the us had shouldered the global defence burden for too long and saying he would ask all nato members to increase defence spending to 5 of gdp. the nato secretary-general, mark rutte, has urged member states to use the threats from washington as an incentive to take unilateral action on raising defence contributions. last month, rutte said the pressure was already paying off in countries such as spain, portugal, belgium and italy. i tell them that, well, now i am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2 by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2 because we have to spend much, much more than 2 but now i am calling you, but you might get a very, erm, patient man from washington on the line if you dont listen to me, he said.

vehicles imported from the united states that are not compliant with the u.s.-mexico-canada trade deal, prime minister mark carney told a press conference on thursday. carney also said the new tariffs would not apply to auto parts and would not affect vehicle content from mexico. two senior lawmakers on the senate finance committee introduced legislation on thursday aimed at limiting u.s. president donald trumps ability to impose tariffs and requiring congressional approval for new levies within 60 days. republican senator chuck grassley and democrat maria cantwell presented a bill that mandates the president to notify congress about new tariffs, providing an explanation of the rationale along with an analysis of the potential impact on u.s. businesses and consumers. congress must pass a joint resolution of approval for the new tariff within 60 days otherwise, all new tariffs on imports would expire. this bill reasserts congress role over trade policy to ensure rules-based trade policies are transparent, consistent, and benefit the american public, cantwell said. as representatives of the american people, congress has a duty to stop actions that will cause them harm. the bill is based on the war powers resolution of 1973 and aims to reestablish limits on the presidents authority to impose unilateral tariffs without congressional approval. for too long, congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch, grassley said. grassleys home state of iowa relies significantly on farm crop exports, whereas cantwells washington state hosts many export-driven companies like boeing. the senate passed legislation on wednesday that would terminate new tariffs on canada. with reporting from reuters the

  Title: Bucking Trump tariffs, California will push to maintain global trade independently, Newsom says
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-04 14:57:41)
  Content: gov. gavin newsom announced friday that california will look for ways to expand trade and persuade international partners to exempt the state from global payback as president trumps sweeping round of tariffs has sent u.s. and global financial markets tumbling. were not scared to use our market power to fight back against the largest tax hike of our lifetime, newsom posted friday on the social media platform x. in a video , he noted that the 40 million residents of california live in the tent pole of the us economy that represents 14 of the nations gdp. newsom, a democrat who has frequently sparred with trump, said he had directed his administration to look at new opportunities to expand trade and to remind our trading partners around the globe that california remains a stable partner. california is not washington, d.c. newsom told californias international partners in a news release. the golden state will remain a steady, reliable partner for generations to come, no matter the turbulence coming out of washington. california leads the nation in manufacturing and agriculture, and tariffs could adversely affect many sectors of the states economy, from the tech industry to the ports. but its unclear exactly how newsoms efforts to carve out exemptions would work or whether a state can forge such exceptions. a newsom administration official said on background that nations have wide latitude to shape and target retaliatory tariffs. in a news release, the governors office said that it would work to pursue collaborative opportunities with trading partners that protect californias economic interests and the broader supply chains linked to the states economy. the administration, it said, will explore ways to support job creation and innovation in industries reliant on cross-border trade, promote economic stability for businesses and workers impacted by federal trade disruptions and safeguard access to critical supplies, such as construction materials needed for recovery efforts following the devastating los angeles firestorms. kush desai, a white house spokesman, responded by saying, gavin newsom should focus on out-of-control homelessness, crime, regulations, and unaffordability in california, instead of trying his hand at international dealmaking. newsom has no ability to dissuade trump from his tariffs, which would likely mean fewer imports and higher prices for california, said jonathan d. aronson, a professor at usc annenberg who specializes in international trade and communications. but he might be able to persuade some nations not to retaliate against the states industries. california exports a lot of almonds and avocados, a lot of tech and electronics. it might well be something that says, hey, can you not target almonds? can you not target big tech? can you not target these things that we specialize in? aronson said he couldnt think of a precedent for newsoms initiative, which he said was creative. but he noted that it would be a tough message to pitch to china, which provides almost 30 of californias total imports. china cares about only one country, which is china, he said. how much attention would the chinese pay to this? who knows? still, aronson said, even if newsoms pitch is unlikely to move some global payers, it might help if california can persuade some nations that are retaliating to be more targeted. everybody else is not targeting california theyre targeting the united states, and california is getting caught in the wash, aronson said. so, to the extent you can persuade others that were still a good place to deal with and wouldnt you like to come here youve still going to do business with the united states, because were so big if youre going to deal with that, were a reliably sane state. stock markets worldwide plummeted friday after china matched trumps significant raise in tariffs in an escalating trade war. on thursday, the sp 500, dow jones industrial average and nasdaq composite all reached their lowest one-day drops since the economy tanked at the outset of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020. the tariffs hit some of californias top trading partners. trump imposed additional duties of 24 on japan, 25 on south korea and a 34 tariff on china, on top of a 20 tariff applied to that nation over illegal imports of the deadly drug fentanyl. canada and mexico were excluded from both the baseline and reciprocal tariffs, which could ease the effect at the nations grocery stores. most u.s. produce imports come from mexico and canada, including avocados, cucumbers and mushrooms. but the countries still face 25 levies on certain goods and 25 tariffs on imported cars and light trucks. car buyers across south california scrambled this week to make purchases ahead of the tariffs. its going to have a huge, huge impact on manufacturing and supply chains throughout throughout california, economist kevin klowden of the milken institute in santa monica told the times on thursday. we dont have the specialized manufacturing for all of these supply chains, and certainly not at cost in the u.s. trump said the new tariffs represent a turning point globally and for the united states. he dubbed wednesday liberation day, and said it would forever be remembered as the day that american industry was reborn, the day americas destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make america wealthy again. our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not going to happen anymore. its not gonna happen, trump said. this is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in american history. its our declaration of economic independence. over the last decade, california has made concentrated efforts to establish itself nationally and internationally as a beacon of liberal resistance to the administration. during trumps first term, california sued his administration about 120 times over four years, often with success. in the months of trumps current term, california atty. gen. bontas office has joined other states in rekindling that legal fight, challenging the administration on presidential actions on the environment, immigration, voting rights, education policy, dismantling federal agencies and programs and other issues. for years, california leaders have made efforts to establish relationships with foreign leaders and local government officials in other nations, separate from whatever administration occupies the white house. both newsom and former gov. jerry brown entered into agreements with other countries on climate policies, efforts accelerated because of trumps hostility to international environmental cooperation during his first term. after taking office in january, trump withdrew the u.s. from the paris agreement, an international climate accord in which nations worldwide agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to limit global warming. during a trip to the vatican in 2024, newsom met with political leaders in italy to sign a memorandum of understanding on addressing climate change. on a trip to asia last fall, the california governor reached similar agreements with china, the provinces of guangdong and jiangsu, and the municipalities of beijing and shanghai. california also has reached accords with regional governments in canada, mexico, japan, south korea, sweden and norway, among others. since taking office in 2019, newsom also has met personally with former canadian prime minister justin trudeau, chinese president xi jinping and other national leaders. times staff writers michael wilner, laurence darmiento and the associated press contributed to this report.

  Title: Trump ‘Liberation Day’ live: President set to unveil secret tariff plan as world braces for its economic impact
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-02 14:47:57)
  Content: all eyes are on president trump as he prepares to reveal the next phase of his sweeping tariff agenda, leaving global markets fearing a trade war from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. donald trump is preparing to unveil a raft of new tariffs on wednesday afternoon in what the president has repeatedly billed as liberation day. trump has promised to roll out reciprocal dollar-for-dollar tariffs on nations that levy duties on u.s. goods as part of an aggressive attempt to fulfill his administrations america first agenda and correct years of what he deems unfair trade. international markets wait tentatively as the president is expected to unveil his plans at 4 p.m. wednesday at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden at the moment american markets close. plans remain under wraps with trumps team reportedly weighing options through tuesday. however, white house press secretary karoline leavitt stated that the president had already decided his course of action and that the tariffs would go into effect almost immediately. the only way to avoid the new levies, she said, is to move production to the u.s. it follows the liberal candidate for a critical seat on the wisconsin supreme court, susan crawford, who defeated conservative brad schimel in a race seen as a referendum on trump and his billionaire adviser elon musk. former republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is on board with an effort by democrats in the upper chamber led by senators tim kaine, amy klobuchar, and mark warner to end donald trumps made-up emergency that the president has declared against canada allowing him authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on the u.s.s northern neighbor. trump claims the authority by declaring a national emergency caused by the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migration from canada as well as mexico and china. president trump is saying that there is an emergency with canada. canada is a friend, not an adversary. canada is a sovereign nation, not a 51st state, senator kaine of virginia said on tuesday. this morning, cnns haley talbot reports that the list of republicans who will vote yes on a tariffs resolution up for a vote today at around 7 p.m. has grown to include the former gop leader of the senate. kaine said he approached mcconnell last night and didnt even get to the question before the kentucky senator said im with you. other republicans in support of the move to at least symbolically rebuke the president on his trade policy just a few hours after his liberation day announcement on reciprocal tariffs expected to cover a large swathe of u.s. trading partners include senators susan collins, lisa murkowski, and rand paul. senator thom tillis also told cnn that he doesnt plan on voting for kaines resolution, but has some concerns with the trade policies being discussed, adding, we need to see what comes out tomorrow wednesday and be instructed by that before we take action. earlier, trump wrote in part on truth social mitch mcconnell of kentucky, susan collins of maine, lisa murkowski of alaska, and rand paul, also of kentucky, will hopefully get on the republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize canada for the sale, into our country, of large amounts of fentanyl, by tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy. they are playing with the lives of the american people, and right into the hands of the radical left democrats and drug cartels. the senate bill is just a ploy of the dems to show and expose the weakness of certain republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the house will never approve it and i, as your president, will never sign it. after breaking the record for the longest senate speech in history, cory booker now seems to have broken the internet, with a slew of praise, memes and even tiktok videos commemorating his mammoth achievement. the new jersey democrat took to the senate floor on monday evening, saying he would remain there as long as he was physically able. the speech lasted a whopping 25 hours and 5 minutes. mike bedigan looks at some of the online reactions. it was fitting that cory booker was recounting a story about the late civil rights leader john lewis as he entered the 19th minute and 24th hour of a historic speech to the senate on tuesday evening. in that moment, the first black senator for new jersey broke a record for the longest speech ever made in congress, one that was set 67 years ago by the segregationist democrat strom thurmond, who spoke for a day and a night in opposition to the civil rights act. overcome with emotion, booker looked up to the ceiling and touched his heart as his fellow democrats in the chamber applauded his effort. one of msnbcs morning joe hosts is delighting in the fact that the wisconsin supreme court candidate backed by elon musks lost - even after the tech mogul dumped millions into the race. wisconsin voters elected liberal justice susan crawford to the states supreme court on tuesday, beating brad schimel by more than 200,000 votes in the most expensive judicial election in u.s. history. the vote keeps the high courts 4-3 liberal majority intact. musk repeatedly played up the stakes of the election, claiming it will direct the destiny of humanity and the future of the world is at stake. now, morning joe host joe scarborough is reveling in the massive loss musk suffered. katie hawkinson reports from washington, d.c. the u.s. has sent a three-person team to myanmar to help respond to the 7.7-magnitude earthquake, in a move criticized as weak and irrelevant by a former aid official. much larger russian and chinese teams have already been helping search-and-rescue efforts in the country for days. steffie banatvala reports. a mother and her three children were wrongfully detained by immigration enforcement agents in new york and taken to a detention facility in texas, a nonprofit says as it calls for their release. immigration and customs enforcement officers detained the mother - whose birth country was not disclosed - and her kids, one of whom is in third grade, on march 27 while they were executing an arrest on a farm in sackets harbor, new york, according to the new york immigration coalition. kelly rissman reports. elon musk broke his silence after suffering defeat in the wisconsin supreme court race, which cemented a liberal majority for the next three years. susan crawfords win keeps the court under a 4-3 liberal majority in the face of crucial litigation surrounding abortion access, voting rights and redistricting. like president donald trump, musk chose to focus on the background win of wisconsin voters approving the constitutional amendment to enshrine voter id laws, a vote that was being held at the same time as the supreme court race. this was the most important thing, musk posted on x in response to a post on voter id. madeline sherratt has the full story. kelly loeffler, former georgia senator and now head of the small business administration in the trump administration, hailed donald trumps liberation day as the single greatest salvation, for not just small businesses, but for america, during an appearance on fox business this morning. the president eagerly posted a clip of her conversation with maria bartiromo to his truth social account italys prime minister giorgia meloni and the countrys top business lobby warned on wednesday that impending u.s. tariffs could significantly impact the nations exports and its already struggling economy. it is clear that the introduction of new tariffs would have heavy repercussions for italian producers, meloni said while hosting a prize-giving ceremony for italian cuisine in rome. meloni added that she did not rule out adequate responses to protect the exports of the euro zones third largest economy, though she did not provide further details. italy recorded a trade surplus with the united states of 39 billion euros 42.14 billion in 2024, the third largest in the 20-nation euro area, according to eurostat data. earlier on wednesday, the business association confindustria reported that italys economy is expected to grow by 0.6 this year, half of the governments official target and down from a 0.9 forecast made by the group in october. the economy expanded by a modest 0.7 in both 2024 and 2023. it managed to achieve 0.1 growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the previous three months, after stagnating in the third quarter. most analysts do not foresee any significant rebound in the near term. confindustria indicated that while its forecasts accounted for the already-announced u.s. tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as what it termed record levels of uncertainty regarding trade policy, they did not consider the effects of an escalating trade war. in a worst-case scenario, with permanent 25 u.s. tariffs on all imports, rising to 60 for china, coupled with retaliatory measures against u.s. exports, italys growth could decline to around 0.2 this year, it said. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Trump warned US economy to be hit hardest by tariff war: Live updates - The Independent
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 15:31:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Realism, one might interpret the trade policy discussions as reflecting a state-centric view where national economic gain is prioritized, potentially at the expense of global stability. The text notes the 'aggressive tariff plans' and the claim that they 'would produce great benefits for american workers' while simultaneously acknowledging the negative impact on 'nearly all countries' and the risk of 'global recession'. This aligns with a realist perspective where states pursue self-interest in a competitive international system, viewing economic interactions through a zero-sum lens.; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory appears relevant in examining how specific issues gain prominence. The article highlights media reports (NBC News, Bloomberg, BBC) focusing on the Hegseth information leak and the economic consequences of tariffs, alongside official statements (Leavitt on student loans, Vance on tariffs, Bessent on China). This suggests that the selection and emphasis of these topics by both media and officials shape the public agenda, potentially diverting attention from or amplifying certain narratives over others.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents conflicting or potentially erroneous naming conventions for administration officials. Textual Basis: It refers to a 'press secretary karoline hegseth' and later 'white house press secretary karoline leavitt', and mentions 'treasury secretary scott bessent' immediately after discussing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a way that could cause confusion. Significance: Such inconsistencies, if not simple typos, could suggest reporting errors or a lack of clarity in official communication, potentially impacting the perceived reliability of the information presented. Probing Questions: Are these naming variations indicative of reporting inaccuracies, and how might such details influence a reader's trust in the overall narrative? What does the juxtaposition of the Defense Secretary and Treasury Secretary discussions imply about the article's structure or underlying connections the author perceives?

afford it. donald trumps tariffs raise the chance of a u.s. recession, and a subsequent global recession to almost 100 percent, kenneth rogoff, a former chief economist at the international monetary fund, told the bbc on tuesday. the u.s. economy will be one of the hardest hit by the aggressive tariff plans, the imf warned earlier in the day as it slashed forecasts for global economic growth, with the u.s. dropping to just 1.8 percent, from a previous forecast of 2.7 percent. the global economic growth forecast was cut by half a percentage point, with downgrades in nearly all countries amid ongoing uncertainty from the trump administrations trade policy. this came after vice president jd vance admitted that president donald trumps aggressive tariff increases will profoundly change the u.s. economy and other nations. in a speech in india, vance said the rebalancing from aggressive tariffs would produce great benefits for american workers. earlier, gold prices surged to a record high while the value of the u.s dollar plunged, following trumps latest attack on the federal reserve chair jerome powell. press secretary karoline hegseth was asked about embattled defense secretary pete hegseth at todays white house briefing. she told reporters that president donald trump continues to stand behind hegseth. white house press secretary karoline leavitt has announced that the education department will resume involuntary collections for defaulted student loans on may 5th. they will recoup loans and go after tax refunds, federal pensions and even their wages, of those who owe money. if you take out a loan, you have to pay it back very simple, leavitt said. defense secretary pete hegseth pulled the airstrike information he posted into signal chats with his wife, brother and dozens of others from a secure communications channel used by u.s. central command, raising new questions as to whether the embattled pentagon head leaked classified information over an open, unsecured network. nbc news first reported that the launch times and bomb drop times of u.s. warplanes that were about to strike houthi targets in yemen details that multiple officials have said is highly classified were taken from secure u.s. central command communications. a person familiar with the second chat confirmed that to the associated press. press secretary karoline leavitt confirmed president donald trumps upcoming travel plans at todays white house briefing. the president will depart washington, d.c., on friday to travel to rome for the funeral of pope francis on saturday, returning that evening. from may 13-16, the president will travel to saudi arabia, qatar, and the united arab emirates all key allies in the gulf. this thursday, norways prime minister jonas gahr stoere and finance minister jens stoltenberg will meet with trump at the white house. president donald trump has said that the u.s. stands strong with india against terrorism, after todays deadly attack in kashmir. read more about the attack here former vice president al gore lashed out at the trump administration in a fiery speech about the climate crisis, comparing its attempts to create their own preferred version of reality to that of adolf hitlers third reich. ariana baio reports from new york. kenneth rogoff, a former chief economist of the international monetary fund, says that if president donald trump doesnt retreat on his tariffs, the chance of a u.s. recession and subsequent global recession is almost 100 percent. rogoff was speaking to bbc radio 4s pm programme in the u.k. today. defense secretary pete hegseth doubled down during a tuesday morning fox and friends interview, insisting that the information on airstrike launches and bomb drop times that he shared with his wife, brother, and dozens of others in two separate signal chats was not classified. hegseth didnt deny the existence of a separate chat instead, he attacked the media and his former staff, whom he accused of leaking information about the chats. his repeat denial comes as nbc news reported tuesday that the information hegseth posted came directly from secure communications from the head of u.s. central command, gen. erik kurilla. the pentagons inspector general is investigating the chats. the material kurilla sent included details about when u.s. fighters would take off and when they would hit their targets details that could, if they fell into the wrong hands, put the pilots of those fighters in grave danger. but he was doing exactly what he was supposed to providing hegseth, his superior, with information he needed to know and using a system specifically designed to safely transmit sensitive and classified information. but then hegseth used his personal phone to send some of the same information kurilla had given him to at least two group text chats on the signal messaging app, three u.s. officials with direct knowledge of the exchanges told nbc news. the sequence of events, which has not previously been reported, could raise new questions about hegseths handling of the information, which he and the government have denied was classified. in all, according to the two sources, less than 10 minutes elapsed between kurillas giving hegseth the information and hegseths sending it to the two group chats, one of which included other cabinet-level officials and their designees and, inadvertently, the editor of the atlantic magazine. one of them was composed of hegseths wife, brother and attorney and some of his aides. treasury secretary scott bessent told a closed-door investor summit tuesday that the tariff standoff with china is unsustainable and that he expects the situation to de-escalate, bloomberg reports. bessent made the remarks at a jpmorgan chase event on the sidelines of the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings in washington, d.c. he added that negotiations between the u.s. and china have not yet started but that a deal is possible, according to people who attended his session, which wasnt open to the public or media. u.s. stocks rose after his comments, with the sp 500 index gaining as much as 2.9 as of 1228 p.m. in new york, while the dollar and treasuries steadied. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Stock market rallies after closed-door remarks by Treasury Secretary Bessent - Fortune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 20:15:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The recurring mentions of 'Trump tariffs' and 'Trump policy changes' alongside discussions of corporate hits (RTX), market reactions ('volatility spike', 'markets open sharply higher'), and geopolitical shifts ('softens on china', 'china de-escalation') align with aspects of Political Economy theory. This perspective suggests that political decisions and the actions of key political figures (like Trump) are not merely isolated events but have direct, measurable consequences on economic actors (companies like RTX, markets) and international economic relations (China trade). The text provides evidence of this linkage by explicitly connecting policy actions (tariffs, changes) to economic outcomes (hits, market shifts).; Theories_and_interpretations: The juxtaposition of headlines about market reactions to political statements ('investors are finally taking trump seriously', 'markets open sharply higher after trump softens') and the mention of 'agenda-setting' in the context of financial news (implied by the focus on specific topics like tariffs, Fed Chair, China) could be viewed through the lens of Agenda-Setting Theory. While typically applied to media influence on public perception, here it highlights how the *focus* of political figures (Trump's statements on China, Powell) can directly influence the *agenda* of financial markets and news coverage, demonstrating the power of political rhetoric to shape economic attention and action, as evidenced by the immediate market response described.; Intriguing_angles: The text mentions 'doges staffing cuts' as a cause for the IRS's 'nightmare' tax season and potential refund delays. The term 'doges' is unusual in this context and lacks clear identification as a standard entity type (Organization, Government Agency). Its significance lies in being presented as a direct causal factor for a major government agency's operational failure, yet its nature remains undefined within the article. What entity or concept does 'doges' represent in this context, and why is it presented as a singular, impactful cause without further clarification?

  Content: by david latona and corina pons madrid reuters -spain on thursday was one of the few major economies to offer up a concrete solution to help weather the impact of new u.s. tariffs, offering its companies a financial package of loans and direct aid worth 14.1 billion euros 15.66 billion. the tariffs announced by u.s. president donald trump on wednesday have rattled markets and drew condemnation from world leaders facing an abrupt end of an era of trade liberalisation that has shaped the global order for decades. spain, which like other european union members was hit by u.s. tariffs of 20 imposed on imports from the bloc, is the worlds top exporter of olive oil and sells important quantities of auto parts, steel and chemicals to the united states. sanchez described trumps actions as terrible news for the world, unintelligent and a return to 19th-century protectionism. this tariff attack by the u.s. administration makes no distinction between friends and enemies, it doesnt discriminate based on ideology or trade balance its against everyone and everything, he said. sanchez also stressed europes need to find new trading partners elsewhere. he is set to visit vietnam and china next month, attempting to forge closer economic ties with the asian countries. direct aid and soft loans spains aid package - which still needs to be approved by a fragmented parliament - will include 7.4 billion euros in new financing, and the rest will come from existing instruments such as soft loans, sanchez said. he said that 5 billion euros of eu recovery funds would be repurposed to help industries hurt by the tariff shock - such as auto suppliers - reorient their productive capabilities towards other high-demand sectors. the government will also contribute with 2 billion euros worth of credit insurance and export risk coverage. rafael pico, head of the spanish association of olive oil exporters asoliva, welcomed the measures and said the aid would help the industry invest in improving production processes and finding new markets. but he also called on the government to negotiate a reduction in the 20 tariff to align with competitors from other countries that were handed a lower rate. spain exports 180,000 tonnes of olive oil directly to the u.s. while another 180,000 tonnes are sold to germany, italy, belgium and britain before being packaged for export to the u.s., pico said. well see how effective the measures are, but they dont solve the problem of tariffs in a market that is irreplaceable for us, he said. the aid package from the spanish government will serve as a stop-gap so that the most exposed companies are not forced to shut down but it will not offset the loss of u.s. market share, said antonio gonzalez, an economist at the economists against the crisis think tank. trumps tariffs are so brutal that its very hard to see how theyll be compensated through soft loans or subsidies, gonzalez said. sanchez urged the european commission to set up a fund financed by revenues from tariffs on imports from the u.s. that are set to be hiked this month in response to washingtons move that he said was unfriendly and unjustified. spain has sought eu authorisation to allow more flexibility for large-scale domestic aid for the affected sectors. sanchez said he would use a labour law provision similar to a furlough scheme implemented during the covid-19 pandemic to allow the hardest-hit companies to maintain their workforce until they recover. well take advantage of this trade war to give our industry a new impulse for its modernisation and internationalisation, sanchez said. 1 0.9006 euros additional reporting by inti landauro, jesus aguado and emma pinedo writing by charlie devereux editing by andrei khalip, tomasz janowski and ed osmond 2025 thomson reuters.

  Title: Trump announces sweeping new tariffs, baseline tax on imports - Syracuse.com
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-02 21:01:00)
  Content: president donald trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the rose garden at the white house, wednesday, april 2, 2025, in washington. ap photomark schiefelbeinap washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the tariffs follow similar recent announcements of 25 taxes on auto imports levies against china, canada and mexico and expanded trade penalties on steel and aluminum. trump has also imposed tariffs on countries that import oil from venezuela and he plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose have caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy, despite the risk of political backlash as voters in last years election said they wanted trump to combat inflation. senior administration officials, who insisted on anonymity to preview the new tariffs with reporters ahead of trumps speech, said the taxes would raise hundreds of billions of dollars annually in revenues. they said the 10 baseline rate existed to help ensure compliance, while the higher rates were based on the trade deficits run with other nations and then halved to reach the numbers that trump presented in the rose garden. in a follow-up series of questions by the associated press, the white house could not say whether the tariff exemptions on imports worth 800 or less would remain in place, possibly shielding some imports from the new taxes. based on the possibility of broad tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most outside analyses by banks and think tanks see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnating growth. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress . president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. how will trumps tariffs work? how soon until prices might rise?apr. 2, 2025, 854 p.m. trump has blunt words on possible car price hikes amid new tariffsmar. 31, 2025, 956 a.m. because trump had hyped his tariffs without providing specifics until wednesday, he provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. powered by

  Content: updated on april 17, 2025 159 pm edt cbs news small business owners worry that mounting economic uncertainty, driven largely by president trumps shifting tariff policies, could shut their doors for good. beth benike, cofounder of busy baby, told cbs moneywatch that a lack of clarity on the direction of u.s. tariffs poses serious problems for the oronoco, minnesota-based retailer. i am a problem solver. when a decision or policy comes out, ill find a solution. i will work with it or around it, said benike, whose company makes nonslip placemats and other products for babies. the next day, the policy changes and that plan doesnt make sense anymore, so i come up with something else. smaller enterprises that rely on imported goods and packaging from china, which now faces u.s. tariffs of as high as 145, are among the most concerned about mr. trumps trade policies. but a prolonged period of economic uncertainty alone can prove fatal, obscuring future borrowing costs, dampening consumer spending, and otherwise hindering the strategic planning and managerial decision-making involved in running a small business. trump administration officials have staunchly defended their economic policies. just as it did during president trumps first term, the administrations america first economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts and the unleashing of american energy will restore american greatness from main street to wall street, white house spokesman kush desai told cbs moneywatch in a statement. recently, however, tremors in the economy intensified by mr. trumps tariffs have eroded the optimism of small businesses, according to a closely watched confidence gauge. the implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months, william dunkelberg, chief economist of the national federation of independent businesses, said in a statement. the decline in optimism comes as mr. trumps economic agenda roils financial markets and raises concerns about slowing u.s. economic growth. consumers are concerned about the inflationary effects of the tariffs hikes. they understand if prices rise, their real spending power will go down, steven j. davis, a stanford university economist who co-developed an economic policy uncertainty index, told cbs moneywatch. also, some of them also feel that maybe their jobs are at risk, so for both reasons many consumers will cut back on discretionary spending. to be sure, even in the best of times business owners can be caught flat-footed by abrupt changes in the competitive landscape. but risks surge when the economic climate become unpredictable. uncertainty is the enemy of entrepreneurship, neri karra sillaman, an entrepreneurship expert at oxford university, told cbs moneywatch. when the rules of the game are constantly shifting one day you have a pause on tariffs, another day you dont have tariffs, if there are interest rate changes or political and economic instability businesses cannot then confidently invest in growth. smaller businesses, which typically have less of a financial cushion than larger enterprises, tend to struggle more in such an environment, she added. davis, whose own index shows a spike in uncertainty in recent months, said trade policy unknowns are the big source of uncertainty right now inhibiting business investment and hiring. when you have tariffs, they tend to introduce cost unpredictability, which makes it very hard to predict and forecast margins accurately, especially in a product-based business, karra added. busy babys benike said the sudden swerves in u.s. trade policy have made planning all but impossible. if i invest time, energy and money and the policy changes again in a way that makes the decision a poor one, i am already invested, the wheels are in motion and id be screwed, she said. i cant make a decision, so the best thing i can do is get the inventory ive paid for here and ready to sell, she added, referring to her latest factory order, now sitting in a chinese warehouse. meanwhile, the new 125 u.s. baseline tariff on chinese imports means that benike would owe 229,000 in duties on products worth roughly 158,000. she has launched a fundraising campaign to help cover the tariff costs. her plan b, should the steep levies remain in place, is to continue manufacturing her products in china and to sell them to markets outside the u.s. there are babies everywhere. if i cant sell in america, there are other countries that are interested, she said. kristin bear, founder of kilo brava, an online lingerie and sleepwear company that sells both directly to consumers as well as to major retailers including macys, nordstrom and anthropologie, said the sky-high u.s. tariffs on chinese imports wipe out our business completely if they stay in place. we have not imported anything yet with the 145 tariffs in place, but it really puts our business in complete jeopardy, she said. another challenge is that u.s. factories arent equipped to manufacture the types of garments she designs, bear said. and because orders for garments intended for sale this fall must be placed with factories by may, its too late to explore manufacturing options in other countries. said bear, noting that she cant afford to lose a whole seasons worth of orders, equivalent to roughly 500,000 in sales if tariffs are still in place when its time to import them, well just have to abandon the goods and close the company. megan cerullo is a new york-based reporter for cbs moneywatch covering small business, workplace, health care, consumer spending and personal finance topics. she regularly appears on cbs news 247 to discuss her reporting. 2025 cbs interactive inc. .

unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. free trade advocates in the republican partys old guard piled on donald trump as the stock market tumbled sharply downwards on thursday in response to the white houses tariff plan. wednesdays announcement of across-the-board tariffs on nearly all countries that export goods to the us sent markets spiraling in after-hours trading, which solidified into a steep drop thursday morning. reuters reported that the first us job losses from import tariff hikes were taking place in michigan and indiana, where automaker stellantis announced hundreds of temporary layoffs due to idling production facilities in mexico and canada. signs of the backlash from within conservative circles were already evident wednesday afternoon, as a handful of gop senators including former majority leader mitch mcconnell sided with democrats to condemn the presidents trade action. make no mistake goods made in america will be more expensive to manufacture and, ultimately, for consumers to purchase, with higher broad-based tariffs, mcconnell said after his vote. center-right media hammered trump on thursday while us allies showed no signs of backing down and instead openly plotted their own tariff measures in response. a trade war appears imminent on the road ahead. assuming the policy sticksand we hope it doesntthe effort amounts to an attempt to remake the u.s. economy and the world trading system, the murdoch-owned wall street journal editorial board wrote thursday morning. if the response is widespread retaliation, the result could be shrinking world trade and slower growth, recession, or worse, the journal continued. there will certainly be higher costs for american consumers and businesses. on the bulwark, host jonathan last sarcastically quipped thursday the woke socialist markets do not seem to appreciate the brilliance of trumps beautiful, very strong tariffs. the white house fired out its own news release highlighting praise from a handful of industry trade groups, as well as republican members of congress. but over wednesday evening and thursday morning the media and economic experts spent the hours picking apart apparent inconsistencies and other confusing aspects of the liberation day announcement. a top target of ridicule for the white houses usual critics were the 10 percent duties levied on the heard and mcdonald islands, a remote pair of islands controlled by australia with no human population and extremely limited fishing activity, according to forbes. virtually zero exports from the penguin-infested rocks reach the us. impressed the crack white house economic team not only found the heard and mcdonald islandsan uninhabited australian territory which is a two week sail from the mainland requiring a permit to visitbut that they managed to figure out the optimal retaliatory tariff to impose on penguins, wrote justin wolfers, a senior fellow at the brookings institution. on consumer news channel cnbc, one reporter could not hide his disdain for the formula used to calculate the reciprocal tariffs put into place by the white house, which according to a number of economists did not appear to actually factor in tariffs put into place by us trade partners. i started calling international trade economic experts, steve liesman said on the network thursday morning. nobody ever heard of this formula. nobody has ever used this formula. so im sorry, but the conclusion seems to be that the president kind of made this up as he went along. he made it up. ian bremmer of the eurasia group, added this is incredibly stupid. yales nonpartisan budget lab was out with increasingly dire predictions for the us economy after the presidents announcement this week. clothing and apparel prices are set to spike by nearly 20 percent nationwide, according to an analysis published wednesday, while the overall economy will shrink and american households in the middle income bracket will be hit with an annual income loss of around 1,700. i expect the fallout to continue into next week, as everyone is trying to assess what the effect will be on final consumer prices, michael tamvakis, a professor and economist with city st. georges university of london, told the independent on thursday. i imagine any good not available in the domestic us market will be affected, especially any food commodities which have to be imported promptly and have a short shelf life, tamvakis predicted. electronics, pharmaceuticals and auto sales would be among the sectors affected immediately, he explained, with higher drug prices in particular having the potential to hurt poorer americans the most. with the trump administration under a self-acknowledged mandate to bring down consumer prices and inflation, the president could be setting republicans up in a very uncomfortable spot come midterm season. the state of the us economy is likely to be very close to the top of voters minds as congressional reelection campaigns begin in earnest next year and later in 2024, for some. high grocery prices and other issues caused by a trade war could easily lead voters to hand the house back to democratic control for the remainder of trumps term, even if the senate remains out of reach. the real danger trump faces could be from dividing the coalition which has now elected him twice traditional republican voters who want to see the us economy grow and thrive, and maga true believers who are willing to see a contraction if it means reorganizing the economy under an america first vision. democrats, of course, are counting on this as their party continues to grapple with a crisis of confidence. voters remain unhappy with congressional democrats, especially senate minority leader chuck schumer, amid the doge-ification of the federal government and the collapse of democratic resistance in the senate, both in the face of the laken riley act and more recent government shutdown fight. schumer, who saw his party shed three seats in the senate last year, maintains that he still has a winning record in terms of both elections and legislating. a tanking us economy could make that pronouncement a reality come next year. if trump doesnt see things turn around for the us economy before the end of the year, he could well end up handing schumer a lifeline right when his rival needs it most. join thought-provoking

  Title: Global growth forecasts slashed in fallout from tariffs, IMF warns
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 14:39:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Economic Protectionism theory, the article details how the US imposition of tariffs ('us president donald trump unveiled a range of new and higher tariffs') is presented as a direct cause ('leading to global trade disruption', 'forced to change its projections') for predicted negative economic outcomes globally ('significantly slow growth', 'slashing its global growth forecast', 'sharp increase... will lead to a significant slowdown'). This aligns with protectionism's predicted consequences of disrupting trade flows and potentially harming overall global economic efficiency, as highlighted by the IMF's warnings.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article's structure, beginning with the IMF's report and its specific findings on growth forecasts and tariff impacts, suggests an application of Agenda-Setting Theory. The IMF, as a prominent international organization ('the international monetary fund imf has warned'), is positioned as the authoritative source defining the key economic problems (slowed growth, uncertainty, trade war risk) and their primary cause (US tariffs), thereby shaping the public discourse and political reactions presented later in the text.

global trade disruption and unprecedented uncertainty is set to significantly slow growth in economies around the world, the international monetary fund imf has warned. the organisation said it is slashing its global growth forecast by 0.5 percentage points this year, with nearly all countries seeing a downgrade. the latest world economic outlook report was produced under exceptional circumstances, with the imf being forced to change its projections after us president donald trump unveiled a range of new and higher tariffs earlier this month. the imfs top economist, pierre-olivier gourinchas, said we are entering a new era as the global system that has operated for the last 80 years is being reset. he added while many of the scheduled tariff increases are on hold for now, the combination of measures and countermeasures has hiked us and global tariff rates to centennial highs. for this reason, we expect that the sharp increase on april 2 in both tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a significant slowdown in global growth in the near term. global growth is projected to fall from 3.3 in 2024 to 2.8 in 2025, before edging up to 3 in 2026. this is lower than the imfs previous forecasts, published in january, by 0.5 percentage points for 2025 and 0.3 percentage points for 2026. the outlook for nearly all countries has been downgraded, reflecting the direct effect of new trade measures and the knock-on impact on uncertainty, which has surged to unprecedented levels, and deteriorating sentiment among consumers and businesses. the uk economy is predicted to grow by 1.1 this year, 0.5 percentage points less than januarys forecast, partly reflecting tariffs, as well as weaker consumption amid higher inflation driven by bills and energy price hikes. growth will nonetheless be stronger in the uk than germany which is predicted to flatline this year france, and italy. meanwhile, inflation forecasts have been revised upwards for advanced economies since january, with the uk and the us being hit hardest. uk inflation is set to be 0.7 percentage points higher this year, compared with the previous forecast, at 3.1 largely due to prices like water and electricity rising from april. this is higher than all other countries in the group of seven advanced economies g7, which incorporates germany, france, italy, japan, canada, and the us. chancellor rachel reeves said the new forecasts show the uk is still the fastest-growing european country in the g7. the imf have recognised that this government is delivering reform which will drive up long-term growth in the uk, through our plan for change, she said. the report also clearly shows that the world has changed, which is why i will be in washington this week defending british interests and making the case for free and fair trade. shadow chancellor mel stride said at a time when families are looking for stability and support, labours policies are stifling growth, pushing up the cost of living and leaving us vulnerable to external shocks. global trade growth projections have been slashed by 1.5 percentage points since the previous world economic outlook. the imf warned over the increased risk of a trade war, which would particularly hit china and the us but also many countries in asia and europe. the organisation stopped short of forecasting a recession in the us, but slashed its growth forecast for the worlds biggest economy to 1.8, down by 0.9 percentage points since its last prediction. it added that the risk of a recession in the us had increased sharply from about a 25 probability to around 40. china is predicted to grow by 4 this year, down from the imfs previous forecast of 4.6. the imf also stressed that central bank independence was important in the fight against rising inflation amid concerns over mr trumps renewed attack on us federal reserve chairman jerome powell, branding him a major loser for not cutting rates. mr gourinchas said at an imf press briefing the critical thing is to make sure that inflation expectations remain anchored and that central banks do whats necessary to bring inflation back to targets. central banks need to remain credible and part of that is built upon their central bank independence. from that perspective, its very important to preserve that. the imf report also showed that heightened uncertainty around trade policy has also weakened the overall outlook, with many global firms likely to react to tariffs by suspending or reducing investments and cutting spending. banks may also slow lending to businesses while they assess how exposed borrowers will be to the new trade environment. the global economy is being severely tested with the risk that trade retaliation may ratchet up tensions, while financial markets could continue to react sharply to lower growth prospects, according to the imf. however, the imf said there is also the opportunity for more positive consequences depending on how countries work together and address the new challenges. if countries de-escalate from their current tariff stance, and co-ordinate to deliver clarity and stability on trade policy, the outlook could immediately brighten, mr gourinchas said.

  Title: How might Trump tariffs affect UK business on ‘Liberation Day’?

americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. liberation day as the white house grandly calls the unveiling of its new trade policy is finally upon us. but what it actually means and what the impact will be is still not clear, as president donald trump keeps businesses and world leaders waiting until wednesday to unveil the next round of tariffs. while mr trump has suggested all nations will be hit with additional levies and sir keir starmer has admitted the uk is unlikely to escape the new measures its still far from certain exactly which industries will bear the brunt this time, with steel, aluminium and auto parts already subject to additional import costs. heres a look at whats already known, what could happen, and what investors are doing as uncertainty reigns. the top end of the uk stock market has performed relatively well this year, considering concerns over growth, inflation, still-high interest rates and the wider geopolitical landscape. the ftse 100 is up more than 5 per cent year-to-date, in contrast to the us sp 500 being down around the same amount. the uncertainty has hit smaller businesses more, with the ftse 250 down 5.2 per cent in 2025 and the aim all-share index down 4.3 per cent. more recently, while there was a sell-off on monday ahead of these new tariffs, it eventually wasnt as steep as had initially looked the case and tuesday saw investors buying once more on price weaknesses, perhaps hinting that some saw limited further downside in share price terms, even with new tariffs to come. it has always been a fools game at guessing the stock markets most immediate, very next move, but aj bell analysis notes that while the biggest tech stocks in america the so-called magnificent seven have lost a combined 2.3 trillion in the first quarter of this year, they have strong growth prospects well into the future and that status makes them natural candidates to attract widespread buying when markets are more upbeat. in the uk, defence stocks in particular have fared strongly so far, with a domestic political strategy based on increased spending in this area pushing share prices higher while the price of gold, a traditional safe haven for investors, has repeatedly hit new record highs this year and is predicted by some analysts to rise even further across 2025. price hikes and job losses could have a total global economic toll of 1.4 trillion 1.1 trillion under the worst-case scenario according to aston business school. that is if full global retaliation with reciprocal tariffs is the eventual outcome, which would see the us economy in particular hit. naturally, if the entire planet is affected to that scale, the uk wouldnt be exempt, but theres still scope for changing trade paths, perhaps seeking out partners to increase back-and-forth business with if a reliance on the us is no longer plausible. quite aside from the businesses involved, government spending could also be impacted. last week, rachel reeves noted the government was laying out savings to restore 9.9bn of headroom for government expenditure. one assessment of a worst-case scenario involving trump tariffs and the uk suggests that would be entirely and immediately wiped out. david miles, from the office for budget responsibilitys obr budget responsibility committee, told mps if tariffs at 20 25 per cent were put on the uk and maintained for five years, our assessment of what that does is that it will knock out all the headroom that the government currently has. had we made that a central forecast, and had the government not changed policy at all knowing that we were going to take that as our central forecast, then the headroom would have pretty much all gone. mr miles noted the improbability of the extreme scenario, which would include a term beyond the next us presidential elections, but the obr further noted the hit to business confidence across the uk caused by the uncertainty around tariffs and other costs. at the other end of the scale, theres the perspective that some changes could in fact mean the uk might actually benefit from a trade war. again, its important to note thats on a broad, all-encompassing term there would still be businesses or industries negatively affected within that. but the obr noted that if the uk avoided involvement in a trade war, reciprocal tariffs and the like, some redirected trade flows could end up increasing business this side of the water. much of that is based around the fact that the uk-us trade deficit is far more reasonably balanced than, for example, the eu-us one. professor irina surdu-nardella, of warwick business school, told cnbc tariffs could yet have a limited impact on the uk. effects would be relatively limited to industries such as fishing and mining, ms surdu-nardella said, pointing to the service-focused nature of the uk economy meaning much of it would be unscathed by import tariffs. of course, theres also the possibility that mr trump and mr starmer find an agreement whereby british companies end up entirely unaffected by the whole process, potentially giving them a foothold to gain further business with overseas customers. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see

journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. britain must prepare for the worst from new import tariffs, the foreign secretary david lammy said yesterday as the world awaits the start of donald trumps trade war. the united states president has threatened to impose fees of 20 per cent or more on imports from around the world with immediate effect in measures expected to be announced on wednesday which he has dubbed liberation day. global market jitters continued over the potential impact of a trade war, as one study estimated it could cost the world 1.1 trillion. in britain alone, 25,000 jobs are at risk according to the institute of public policy research ippr, which said the new white house trade policy would completely destabilise the uk car manufacturing industry. meanwhile, goldman sachs analysts expected britains gdp to suffer a greater hit than previously feared even if a uk trade deal were agreed, due to larger negative spillovers from tariffs levied against the european union. as a result, the bank now expects 0.8 per cent of uk growth this year and 1.2 per cent in 2026 down from 0.9 and 1.3 respectively. chancellor rachel reeves told a cabinet meeting that there would be a serious impact from the tariffs. and while business secretary jonathan reynolds tried to be optimistic about the prospect of a uk-us deal, he was unable to give a timeline on when one might be completed. ministers were also forced to deny the trump administration was making demands about free speech in the uk as part of any potential trade deal. mr trump has previously announced a 25 per cent tax will be introduced on all cars imported to the us. he has also announced similar tariffs on steel and aluminium. however, the announcement on wednesday is expected to be far more wide-ranging. as the world braces for the impact, ireland warned it could lose up to 80,000 jobs under a worst-case scenario. in the house of commons, mr lammy said intense conversations were still taking place on a possible economic agreement. liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesperson calum miller asked if britain should enter talks with the eu on a customs union to soften the blow of tariffs. mr lammy replied its hugely important at this time that we continue the intense conversations were having with the us administration on getting an economic agreement but of course we prepare for the worst all options remain on the table, as the prime minister indicated. earlier, tory leader kemi badenoch had admitted she has not tried to use her relationship with senior white house figures, such as vice-president jd vance, to avoid tariffs. researchers at the ippr warned that employees at jaguar land rover and mini are some of the most exposed to a potential trade war. some 16.9 per cent of uk car exports were to the us last year, representing a total of more than 101,000 units worth 7.6bn. ippr research fellow pranesh narayanan said trumps tariffs have huge potential to completely destabilise the uk car manufacturing industry, affecting tens of thousands of jobs and putting the governments growth plans in jeopardy. meanwhile, a new study from the aston business school in birmingham estimates a global trade war could cost 1.4 trillion 1.1 trillion. the research maps six escalating scenarios, starting with us tariffs on canada, mexico and china, through to full global retaliation, with associated wider losses. earlier, sir keir starmer told sky news the likelihood is there will be tariffs. nobody welcomes that. we are obviously working with the sectors most impacted at pace on that. nobody wants to see a trade war but i have to act in the national interests. he said he hoped the deal being negotiated with the us would mitigate the tariffs. asked if he had been played by mr trump amid his efforts to build a good relationship, the prime minister said the us is our closest ally. our defence, our security, our intelligence are bound up in a way that no two other countries are. so its obviously in our national interest to have a close working relationship with the us, which weve had for decades, and i want to ensure we have for decades to come. he said talks on an economic deal would normally take months or years but in a matter of weeks we have got well advanced in those discussions. the pm is willing to offer us big tech firms a large tax cut in a bid to avoid tariffs, according to the guardian. the uk government is said to be considering reducing the headline rate of its digital services tax dst and to broaden its scope to include companies from other countries, a move which would represent a significant concession to us tech firms. the tax currently imposes a 2 per cent levy on tech firms, including us giants such as amazon, meta, alphabet, ebay and apple and generates about 800m a year. if it is lowered and applied to other countries it could satisfy mr trump, who has complained about the impact that dsts are having on us firms. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

points to 3.95. but the rally faded somewhat after a solid us jobs and comments from fed chair jerome powell suggested that the central bank is focused on the impact of tariffs on inflation dashed expectations for immediate rate cuts. still, money markets have priced in nearly four quarter-point rate reductions this year, up from just three cuts before the levies were announced wednesday. listen to the heres why podcast on apple, spotify or anywhere you listen everything today is being driven by the expectation that the economy is going to take a major hit, said jan nevruzi, an interest-rate strategist at td securities. earlier in the session, china announced it would impose a 34 tariff on all imports from the us, raising the specter of a global trade war. later, powell said the economic impact of new tariffs is likely to be significantly larger than expected. it was the central bank chiefs first public appearance since march 19, when policymakers opted to hold rates steady, as expected. then, the fed lowered median projections for gdp and lifted those for inflation. still, powell said after the meeting that policymakers base case was that a tariff-induced inflation bump would be transitory. on friday, trump urged the fed to cut interest rates, one day after he said he welcomed the slide in 10-year yields. treasury secretary scott bessent has said repeatedly that lower treasury yields are a priority for the administration. trump will tell them to feel the market and eventually they will cut not in may, though, said neil dutta, head of us economic research at renaissance macro research. powell is focused on inflation expectations even as financial conditions have tightened. thats hawkish, all else equal. the ongoing reaction across markets has been stark. the sp 500 saw its worst two-day plunge since march 2020 in a rout that has shed about 5 trillion in value, with the gauge down 6 on friday. the nasdaq 100 entered a bear market. markets have priced in a roughly 50 probability of a quarter-point rate reduction at the next fed meeting in may. some traders are even betting on an emergency rate cut before the may 6-7 meeting, with open interest in the april fed funds futures soaring. many of the moves persisted even after march employment data released friday showed that 228,000 nonfarm jobs were created, exceeding the 140,000 median forecast of economists in a bloomberg survey. january and february job gains were revised lower, though, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2. what bloomberg strategists say. a lot of this bond market rally will have to be reversed in the next couple of months. and with no relief from discount rates implied by treasury yields, equities will suffer even more as a consequence. this is stagflation with inflation as the binding constraint. edward harrison, the everything risk newsletter, washington the bond market is seeming to keep its focus on the tariff news, said zachary griffiths, head of investment-grade and macroeconomic strategy at creditsights. european bonds have been swept up in the bond rally, anticipating a hit to growth from the 20 us tariff. germanys 10-year yield, the regional benchmark, has plunged this week, erasing the surge unleashed by the nations increased spending plans in march. traders also expect the european central bank to lower rates more sharply, with three quarter-point reductions fully priced in for this year and a chance of a fourth. the bank of england also is seen easing 74 basis points. the global bond surge even saw sub-zero rates return in some corners. the bid yield on two-year swiss government bonds turned negative for the first time since 2022. the swiss national bank cut its key policy rate to 0.25 from 1.75 last year, and traders are betting on at least another quarter-point cut by the end of 2025, with some hedging for further easing. bloomberg economics estimates us tariffs could reduce us demand for swiss goods goods by around 60. for mark dowding, chief investment officer at rbc bluebay asset management, the repricing has already gone far enough. he doubts that both the fed and ecb will be able to respond to tariffs with monetary easing, citing inflationary concerns in the us and an emphasis on fiscal support in europe, and is instead looking for entry points to bet against bonds once markets settle. the rally in bond yields appears overdone, he wrote in a note. we think the fed will do nothing for the foreseeable future, as long as there is not a large rise in unemployment. treasuries have already rallied 3.8 this year, according to a bloomberg gauge of us debt. in the us, fed officials have said that a resilient labor market and sticky inflation mean they can afford to stand pat, even as trumps tariffs sapped consumer and business confidence. this jobs report is going to create an absolute mess for the fed response to economic risks, said guy lebas, chief fixed income strategist for janney montgomery scott. the best case for risk assets is that the data deteriorate quickly enough to generate a fed response. the bad case for risk assets is that jobs muddle through in the face of warmer short-term inflation prints. economists generally expect that tariffs will lift inflation and slow growth, keeping the fed in wait-and-see mode. but the tariffs unveiled wednesday were larger than anticipated, clouding the picture. while morgan stanley now expects no cuts this year, down from one previously, citing inflation risks, ubs global wealth management see more easing this year. vineer bhansali, chief investment officer and founder of longtail alpha, said hes buying two-year notes and selling 30-year bonds, a trade known as a curve steepener. its a bet that a slowing economy will force the fed to lower interest rates, while elevated inflation would lead long-term bonds to underperform. that growing wager is reflected in the market, with the yield difference between two-year and 30-year bonds widening. the distribution of possible outcomes has gotten flatter, bhansali said. anything can happen. now that the us has

  Title: Michael Goodwin: Trump bets the White House — and GOP control of Congress — on tariffs
  Source: nypost.com (2025-04-05 20:09:02)
  Content: maybe all that winning was becoming boring. whatever the reasons that led president trump to rock the globe with his liberation day tariff regime, the immediate result has been a world of hurt for millions upon millions of americans. the stock market meltdown that wiped out some 6.4 trillion of value last thursday and friday means many households saw 10 or more of their nest eggs suddenly erased. their pain is matched only by their confusion about why the president triggered the sell-off. after all, trump 2.0 was scoring major successes by sealing the border and deporting alien criminals. the doge audit was proving his claims of massive government waste and fraud. similarly, his crackdown on columbia and other universities that allow hamas supporters to harass and intimidate jewish students is rattling the radicals where it hurts most in their multimillion dollar federal grants. meanwhile, his election provided a big boost to the economy, which has been humming along. because he has been faithful to his campaign promises, polls show trump with the highest approval rating hes ever had. his winning streak is not the only thing in jeopardy. given the tumult on wall street and in markets around the world, its reasonable to conclude that trump is betting his presidency and gop control of congress on the tariff gambit. that probably wasnt his plan, but like it not, thats how its playing out. the early returns are not promising. by 15 percentage points, voters hold a negative view of trumps handling of inflation and most oppose his emphasis on tariffs, a wall street journal poll finds. negative views of his economic stewardship outweigh positive views by 8 points, according to the survey, which was completed before markets tanked last week. public doubts about the economy are dramatic when you recall how important the subject was to trumps victory. his attacks on bidenomics and inflation became a key reason why trump swept the seven swing states and his party carried congress. yet demoralized and divided democrats now smell blood as some voters begin to sour. the disruption caused by the tariff war is so severe that jpmorgan economists predict it could take a big bite out of americas gross domestic product this year and warn that if, the tariffs remain in place, there is a 60 chance of a global recession. federal reserve chairman jerome powell, no fan of trumps to start with, said the tariffs could lead to both higher inflation and slower growth. naturally, the fear gauges are also rising among congressional republicans. texas sen. ted cruz said friday that if the tariff war pushes the us into a recession, particularly a bad recession, 2026 in all likelihood politically would be a bloodbath. you would face a democrat house, and you might even face a democrat senate. none of this is certain, of course, nor is it meant to suggest trumps goal isnt worthy. leveling global trade is admirable and a core tenet of his america first approach. he aims to protect and expand domestic manufacturing and create good, well-paying jobs by giving more companies incentives to move their headquarters and factories to the united states. its been a consistent theme since he entered politics in 2015 with a rousing denunciation of the globalists whose unfair trade practices hollowed out large industries in middle america. and he celebrated his 2024 win by hosting business titans at mar-a-lago who promised to invest in america. among them was japans softbank, whose chief executive pledged to invest 100 billion. thats the point of tariffs to incentivize companies to make their products and create jobs in the us. meanwhile, the taxes on imported products also provide washington with a source of revenue, with the white house predicting as much as 700 billion would be collected this year under the new rates, which would help fund tax cuts. if they are reciprocal, which trump insists he wants, tariffs would even the score by punishing imported goods at the same rate as countries do that impose high taxes on american products sold abroad. a prime example of the current imbalance was noted by white house adviser stephen miller why is that if you go to tokyo, theres no american cars, if you go to berlin, theres no american cars, but on our streets, we have every foreign car there is? he added theyve blocked their markets from our cars. president trump is saying that has to end. although the president has repeatedly denied it, the suspicion that the aim is to get trading partners to negotiate was effectively confirmed by trump himself friday afternoon. just had a very productive call with to lam, general secretary of the communist party of vietnam, who told me that vietnam wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s., he posted on truth social. but the first inkling of good news came just hours after china raised its tax on american products to 34, saying reciprocal levies were necessary to stop trumps bullying. subscribe to our daily post opinion newsletter! please provide a valid email address. by clicking above you agree to the terms of use and . china, of course, has long been the poster child of trade imbalances. a study from the us international trade commission reports that the sheer volume of chinas exports to the us outpaced americas exports to china by three to one in 2024. even a sneering axios concedes the facts, writing that china has a long record of trade abuses ip theft, forced technology transfers, state subsidies and market access restrictions for foreign companies. it continues the european union doesnt cheat the way china does. but it protects its own through generous agricultural subsidies and strict regulatory standards that often double as trade barriers. the vat, europes value added tax that can go as high as 27 in some countries, is another barrier on us imports. thus, with restrictive trade practices by other nations, theres often not much difference between friend and foe. leaving aside the predictable legacy media reaction to the turmoil one suspects there was glee in the new york times newsroom over the markets plunge and trumps political predicament there are also conservative skeptics. most of their doubts center on two elements the enormous size of the tariffs and the decision to unleash them all at once. some suggested that more modest rates and an industry-by-industry approach could be more effective because it would focus on specific countries and products, such as steel and aluminum. what do you think? post a comment. another argument is that onshoring cannot happen overnight. for foreign manufacturers to make a decision to relocate means building a facility in the us, hiring workers and producing goods a process that could take many months if not years. trump doesnt have years. the midterm elections are 19 months away. share your stance. please adhere to our the new pm of canada nailed it, he called for zero tariffs between canada and the us so both can become economic powers. this is part of the plan, drive new negotiations that favor the us economy and consumer. but the media wont ever admit that because of tds. im curious to what the next great t. a week of stock market activity doesnt mean that much, really. trump is trying to fix something that has been broken for years, and any change brings anxiety to people. will it work? we will have to wait and see, and the good news about tariffs is that they can be removed or lowered just as quickl. over the past couple of days i have seen videos of obama, pelosi and schumer talking about the unfair us trade tariff balance, especially with china. not one of them did anything to correct it though as it would hurt them politically. i give trump credit for at least trying to level the field. i do. i agree yes we need to fix the tarriff balance but a little at a time so as to preserve the lives of us citizens especially the elderly

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
