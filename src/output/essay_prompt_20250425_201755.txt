  Title: Tariff turmoil: How Tesla and other companies are dealing with the uncertainty of the trade war
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-23 22:23:02)
  Content: new york ap uncertainty over tariffs and an unpredictable trade war is weighing heavily on companies as they report their latest financial results and try to give investors financial forecasts. some tariffs remain in place against key u.s. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. the tariff and trade picture has been shifting for months, sometimes changing drastically on a daily basis. those shifts make it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales. on tuesday, treasury secretary scott bessent said he expects a de-escalation in the trade war between the u.s. and china, but cautioned that talks between the two sides had yet to formally start. heres how several big companies are dealing with the tariff confusion tesla tesla is in a better position than most car companies to deal with tariffs because it makes most of its u.s. cars domestically. but it still sources materials from other nations and will face import taxes. the bigger impact will be seen in the companys energy business. the company said the impact will be outsized because it sources lfp battery cells from china. the broader trade war could also hurt the company as china, the worlds largest electric vehicle market, retaliates against the u.s. tesla was forced earlier this month to stop taking orders from mainland customers for two models, its model s and model x. it makes the model y and model 3 for the chinese market at its factory in shanghai. ceo elon musk, an adviser to president donald trump, on tuesday reiterated that he believes lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity. but he added that ultimately the president decides on what tariffs to impose. akzo nobel the amsterdam-based maker of paints and coatings for industrial and commercial use said the big risk from tariffs could come in the form of lower demand for its products. the company said almost all sales of finished goods in the u.s. were locally produced, with the majority of raw materials locally sourced. over the years, we deliberately localized both our procurement and production in the u.s., said ceo gregoire poux-guillaume, in a conference call with analysts. we also largely run china for china and use the rest of asia instead as an export base. the companys products range from paints and coatings for the automotive industry to the do-it-yourself homeowner. broader tariffs could squeeze consumers and businesses and hurt sales. boston scientific the medical device maker said it expects most of the effecs of tariffs to hit the company during the second half of the year, but that it can absorb the impact. the company raised its earnings and revenue forecasts for the year, despite the tariffs. it estimates a 200 million impact from tariffs in 2025, but said it can offset that through higher sales and reductions in discretionary spending. the company said it has a long-standing supply chain around the globe and has made significant investments in the u.s. boeing boeing said much of its supply chain is in the u.s. and many of its imports from canada and mexico are exempt from tariffs under an existing trade agreement. the company does have suppliers in japan and italy, but it expects to recover those tariff costs. the net annual cost of higher tariffs on the supply chain is less than 500 million. a bigger concern is the potential for retaliatory tariffs, which could impact its ability to deliver aircraft. china, a key target for u.s. tariffs, has retaliated in part by no longer accepting deliveries of boeing aircraft. att att, like its peers in the telecommunications sector, faces higher costs for cellphones and other equipment. the company said it believes it can manage anticipated higher costs, based on the current pause in some tariffs and its supply chain. the magnitude of any increase will depend on a variety of factors, including how much of the tariffs the vendors pass on, the impact that the tariffs have on consumer and business demand, said ceo john stankey, on a conference call with analysts.

  Title: Police seize enough fentanyl ‘to kill everyone in Portland twice,’ arrest 46 in multi-agency trafficking crackdown
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-22 23:31:33)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article highlights a state-level response (law enforcement agencies) to a perceived threat (fentanyl trafficking) originating from a non-state actor (Sinaloa Cartel) across international borders. This aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize security and power in an anarchic international system. The quote 'our partnership with local, state, and federal agencies makes our collective response stronger' exemplifies the state's attempt to consolidate power to address the threat.; Intriguing_angles: The article emphasizes the success of the operation and the collaboration between agencies, but it doesn't delve into the root causes of the drug crisis or the social factors contributing to drug use and trafficking. This omission could be a deliberate choice to focus on the immediate law enforcement response rather than addressing the more complex underlying issues. What are the long-term strategies to address the root causes of drug trafficking and addiction in Portland?

  Title: 100 DAYS OF PUNISHING FOES...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article demonstrates how Trump actively shapes the public's perception by prioritizing certain narratives (e.g., 'political weaponization,' 'lies and abuses') and repeatedly emphasizing them. The text states Trump 'repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate' and 'denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him.' This constant reinforcement influences which issues voters deem important, potentially overshadowing other concerns.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the speed and scope of Trump's actions, noting that 'even the smallest slights drawing reprisals.' This suggests a potential underlying mechanism of personal vendettas driving policy decisions, raising questions about the stability and predictability of the administration's actions. What are the long-term consequences of such personalized governance?; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work.' This raises questions about the ethical implications of such arrangements and whether they constitute a form of extortion or coercion. Does this set a dangerous precedent for future interactions between the government and private entities?

  Content: reuters -hours after swearing an oath to defend the u.s. constitution on january 20, president donald trump signed an executive order directing his attorney general to scour the justice department and other agencies for evidence of political weaponization. the same day, pentagon staff took down a portrait of mark milley, a trump critic who as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been the highest-ranking military officer during trumps first term. that evening, trump stripped his former national security adviser, john bolton - who wrote a memoir critical of trump - of the protective secret service detail he had been given after the justice department said iran had threatened boltons life. in his first 100 days, trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies. these include former intelligence officials who investigated alleged russian ties to his 2016 election campaign and major law firms as well as former biden administration members and prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against him while he was out of power. trumps actions served notice that his campaign promise of political retribution was anything but rhetorical, after he repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate. but the speed and sweep of his actions have caught many by surprise, with even the smallest slights drawing reprisals. the republican president has used the machinery of the state and the power of the presidency to go after people and institutions that have aggrieved him in more expansive ways than any of his predecessors, historians said. its not unusual for presidents to have enemies, said jeremi suri, a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin. what is unusual is for the president to use the entirety of the federal government, not simply to exclude someone, but to directly punish them. trump has made particular use of executive orders - typically used by presidents to direct policy priorities - to target perceived foes by stripping them of security clearances, blocking them from government buildings or directing agencies to probe them for wrongdoing. he has launched multiple federal probes into maine after a verbal spat with the states governor, reached deep into the traditionally independent justice department to fire those he views as disloyal, pulled protective security details from his critics and ordered investigations into former officials who challenged his false claims that his 2020 election loss was rigged. on his first day in office, he removed clearances for 50 former national security officials who had signed a letter suggesting russia was behind a story about salacious material found on a laptop belonging to president joe bidens son hunter. no evidence of russian involvement has emerged. he has also taken away clearances for all three democrats who ran against him in presidential contests biden, hillary clinton and kamala harris. trump has focused much of his attention on the criminal justice system after claiming during his 2024 presidential campaign that his four indictments were motivated by politics. then-president joe bidens administration denied the accusations. in trumps first 100 days, his justice department has fired or demoted dozens of officials, prosecutors and fbi agents, including rank-and-file employees who worked on investigations into trump and the january 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob of trump supporters. in a speech at the justice departments headquarters in february, trump denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him with illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. traditional presidencies have failed to bring meaningful change to the ways of washington, and the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy, a white house spokesman, harrison fields, said in response to questions about trumps retribution efforts and whether they represent an abuse of power. utilizing every tool afforded by the constitution, the trump administration is prioritizing efficiency eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and fulfilling every campaign promise. the ferocity and the scope during his first term, trumps instincts for revenge were sometimes thwarted by his own appointees, many of whom were experienced government hands or establishment republicans. by contrast, trump has filled his second-term administration with steadfast loyalists more likely to back his directives than caution against them. meanwhile, the republican majority in congress has shown little interest in opposing his actions. trump has taken steps as well to eliminate internal watchdogs who might seek to constrain him, purging inspectors general and firing government ethics officials. all administrations, particularly when you see a switch from one party to another, seek to control the executive branch, said historian timothy naftali, the former director of the richard nixon presidential library and museum. its the ferocity and the scope of what hes done that makes it unprecedented. the republican nixon famously had a list of enemies, but he plotted against them in secret. his most aggressive ideas, such as using the tax-collecting internal revenue service to audit his foes, were often blocked by his own officials. other presidents have used their power to penalize rivals in more muted ways, suri said. democrat lyndon johnson sought to discredit his political rival, robert kennedy, in the news media, and republican george w. bush banned brent scowcroft, a former national security adviser, from the white house after scowcroft wrote a column opposing the iraq war. thats often how presidents use their power to go after enemies they keep them out of their administration and spread rumors about them, suri said. trump has frequently intertwined his personal animus against political opponents with his administrations ideological and policy objectives. in february, trump digressed from remarks during a white house meeting with governors to address maine governor janet mills, warning her to comply with an order banning transgender athletes. see you in court, mills, a democrat, replied defiantly. within a day, three separate federal departments had initiated inquiries into whether the state was violating civil rights law, imperiling millions of dollars in federal funding. the justice department sent mills a letter telling her maine was on notice while trump demanded a full-throated apology before the case can be settled. in early april, trumps agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, wrote mills to confirm that some school funding had been frozen. this is only the beginning, rollins warned her. nine days later, the education department said it was taking steps to cut off all federal school funding to the state, and last week attorney general pam bondi announced the justice department had sued maine in federal court. in recent weeks, trump has attacked law firms that once employed attorneys he views as enemies, arguing they undermined the judicial process by doing so. in february, he suspended security clearances for attorneys at the law firm covington burling who had represented smith, the former special counsel investigating him, and sought to cancel any government work the firm had. making little effort to hide his primary motivation, trump suggested sending the pen he used to sign the order to smith as a souvenir. trump has signed executive orders targeting five other law firms, in each case indicating that revenge was an essential factor. his order punishing wilmerhale, for instance, noted that it once employed robert mueller, who investigated whether trumps 2016 campaign had improper connections with russia. nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work on mutually agreed projects backed by the administration. in some cases, trump simply appears determined to get even with former members of his 2017-2021 administration who irked him. this month, the president ordered the justice department to investigate christopher krebs, his former cybersecurity chief who disputed trumps false claims about election fraud in 2020, and miles taylor, a former homeland security official who anonymously wrote a 2019 book critical of trump. signing the executive order targeting the two former officials, trump called taylor a traitor. i think hes guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth, but well find out, he said. dissent isnt unlawful, taylor responded on x. it certainly isnt treasonous. reporting by

  Title: Pope Francis’ conservative critics had a unique way to oppose him: a retired pontiff
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-22 16:36:55)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article highlights how Pope Francis's critics actively worked to shape the narrative surrounding his papacy, using various platforms like social media and conferences. 'From individual protests to social media campaigns, conferences and petitions, conservatives made clear they believed themselves to be more catholic than the pope and forged unusually vocal resistance to his authority.' This demonstrates an attempt to influence public perception and potentially sway future papal elections.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Francis's tolerance of right-wing opposition, even seeming to 'relish in the criticism as evidence of how far a church obsessed with rules and regulations had strayed from jesus gospel-mandated call.' This raises the question: Was this tolerance genuine, or a calculated strategy to highlight the perceived rigidity of his opposition and further legitimize his reforms?

  Content: vatican city ap as amazonian bishops gathered at the vatican on oct. 21, 2019, a man entered a nearby church after dawn and stole three indigenous statues brought to rome for the occasion. he threw them into the tiber river in a videotaped protest to denounce what he called the pagan idolatry taking place on pope francis watch. the incident underscored the lengths to which pope francis traditionalist critics were willing to go to vent their opposition to historys first latin american pope. from individual protests to social media campaigns, conferences and petitions, conservatives made clear they believed themselves to be more catholic than the pope and forged unusually vocal resistance to his authority. their token leaders in the college of cardinals will likely be maneuvering to ensure someone more sympathetic to their sensibilities will be elected to replace francis, who died monday at 88. some wanted me dead every pope has his critics. and francis probably expected he would face opposition to his radical reform agenda after catholics for two generations grew used to more conservative popes. some wanted me dead, he quipped once after he heard some prelates in rome had started plotting a future conclave while he was in the hospital. francis critics were unique in having a living alternate as a point of reference, pope benedict xvi, who resided as pope emeritus in the vatican gardens for the first decade of francis pontificate. such an anomaly made the dynamics of the francis opposition a historical first. it exacerbated divisions that experts say must be addressed before another pope decides to step down. they say norms are necessary to prevent a retired pope from being an inspiration for the faithful in ways that discredit his successor or impact his leadership. francis tolerated the right-wing opposition for a while, often responding to their attacks with silence. at times, he even seemed to relish in the criticism as evidence of how far a church obsessed with rules and regulations had strayed from jesus gospel-mandated call to welcome the stranger, feed the poor and show mercy to all. its an honor if the americans attack me, he once said, referring to the u.s.-based nexus of opposition. after benedicts death in 2022, francis tried to blunt the opposition and consolidate his progressive reforms, even though it seemed the right-wing knives were out for him. within days of benedicts funeral, his longtime secretary published a tell-all memoir highly critical of francis. it also emerged posthumously that cardinal george pell wrote a devastating memo that circulated anonymously, calling francis pontificate a catastrophe. while saying he welcomed criticism, francis tried to neutralize the opposition through key appointments and targeted removals, even while trying to make the church a welcoming field hospital for wounded souls, especially lgbtq catholics. after one gesture of outreach francis approved blessings for same-sex couples african bishops united in disapproval in a remarkable continent-wide dissent to a papal directive. if you look at all the history of the reform of the church, where you have the strongest resistance or debated points, its really usually a very important point, said sister nathalie becquart, who helped spearhead one of francis progressive agenda items to make the church more responsive to the needs of laypeople. wary of francis from the start conservative and traditionalist catholics were wary of francis after their beloved benedict became the first pope in 600 years to resign. they grimaced when francis emerged on the loggia of st. peters basilica after his 2013 election without the ermine-rimmed, red velvet cape of his predecessors. they gasped a few weeks later when he washed the feet of women and muslims on holy thursday, a ritual previously restricted to men. we dont like this pope, headlined italys conservative daily il foglio a few months into his papacy. the dictator pope was the title of book by a british traditionalist published a few years later. over time, the critics worst fears came true. one breaking point came in 2016, when francis opened the door to letting divorced and civilly remarried catholics receive communion. some accused francis of heresy. four conservative cardinals formally asked him to clarify himself, issuing dubia or questions to him. they argued church doctrine held that catholics who remarried without a church annulment were living in sin and couldnt receive the sacraments. he never replied. reversing benedict on the latin mass conservatives could not have known that francis would take one of the most controversial steps of his pontificate by reimposing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass that benedict had relaxed. the reversal of benedicts signature liturgical legacy was evidence that francis had essentially declared war on traditionalists, the ancient liturgy and benedicts papacy itself. francis hates us. francis hates tradition. francis hates all that is good and beautiful, the traditionalist blog rorate caeli tweeted. but it concluded francis will die, the latin mass will live forever. francis insisted his aim was to preserve church unity. critics accused him of the opposite, of driving a wedge, and the outrage wasnt limited to u.s.-based conservative catholic media or fringe right-wing bloggers who had popularized francis-bashing. cardinal raymond burke, one of the dubia prelates whom francis sacked early on as the vaticans supreme court justice, blasted the severity of the papal crackdown. guinean cardinal robert sarah, the vaticans retired liturgy chief, responded with tweets quoting benedicts original 2007 law to relax the restrictions that francis had overturned. they were accompanied by a photo of benedict wearing the red cape that francis had eschewed the night of his election. a year earlier, sarah orchestrated a media firestorm by persuading benedict to co-author a book reaffirming priestly celibacy at a time when francis was considering ordaining married men to address a clergy shortage in the amazon. the book, and the prospect of a retired pope trying to influence a reigning one, created the nightmare scenario that canon lawyers and theologians had warned of in 2013, when benedict decided to retain the white cassock of the papacy in retirement and call himself emeritus pope, rather than revert to his birth name. the scandal died down after benedict removed himself as a co-author and francis fired his secretary, archbishop georg gaenswein, believed to have been behind it. after benedict died and gaenswein penned his highly critical, tell-all memoir nothing but the truth, francis exiled him from the vatican. then, after a time in his native germany, made him an ambassador. after burke joined a bigger group of cardinals questioning francis 2023 synod on the churchs future, francis cut him off financially. francis was more tolerant with another critic, the retired archbishop of hong kong, cardinal joseph zen. he excoriated the pope for agreeing in 2018 to a deal with china over the nomination of bishops, accusing francis of selling out chinas underground catholics who stayed loyal to the holy see during decades of persecution. francis received zen at the vatican and later called him a tender soul. francis won few friends with his frequent denunciations of clericalism the idea that priests should be put on a pedestal. he made it a tradition to use his christmas greeting to publicly shame vatican bureaucrats, accusing them of being careerist, money-grubbing gossips with spiritual alzheimers. german cardinal gerhard mueller complained that francis treated vatican monsignors like uneducated children. a major u.s. critic emerges francis biggest conservative critic was the vaticans former ambassador to the u.s., archbishop carlo maria vigano. in 2018, he said francis had covered up accusations that then-cardinal theodore mccarrick, an american, had slept with his seminarians. vigano demanded francis resign for allegedly rehabilitating mccarrick from sanctions imposed by benedict. the furor faded after francis defrocked mccarrick and vigano was discredited with conspiracy theories about covid-19. mccarrick died earlier this month. in 2024, francis excommunicated vigano after finding him guilty of schism. papal biographer austen ivereigh said francis dismantled much of the resistance. he lists the amazonian synod as a defining positive moment of his pontificate - not because of the incident with the statues but because the meeting emphasized his key pastoral priority of accompanying the faithful. the native peoples of amazonia were right here in st. peters square, and francis walked across to the synod with them, ivereigh said, recalling the feathered headdresses and indigenous statues that were on display. the pastor among his people, walking together. and i thought, that is him. that sums him up, he said.

  Title: Trump announces huge new tariffs to promote US manufacturing, risking inflation and trade wars
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 20:57:51)
  Content: by josh boak associated press washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the new tariffs, coming on what trump has named liberation day, are a bid to boost u.s. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he says are years of unfair trade practices. but by most economists assessments, the move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and upend decades-old alliances. the white house is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble. april 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern american history, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said tuesday. she said the new tariffs would take effect immediately. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. based on the possibility of broad 20 tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. because trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. leavitt is among three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the associated press on first and fifth amendment grounds. the ap says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. the white house says the ap is not following an executive order to refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america. associated press writers mike householder in oldcastle, ontario, sylvie corbet in paris and lisa mascaro contributed to this report.

  Title: Republican backlash to Trump tariffs grows as Senate rebels decry ‘bad policy’
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-03 17:29:12)
  Content: the first signs of an internal us political backlash against donald trumps declaration of a global trade war are starting to emerge amid tanking stock markets worldwide, including on wall street, and widespread international criticism of the move. hours after trump unveiled a sweeping panoply of tariffs in an event he dubbed liberation day, four republican senators openly defied him by voting for a senate resolution from democrats demanding that the 25 tariffs on canadian products be reversed. the resolution lacks the force of law but its support from mitch mcconnell and rand paul, both of kentucky, susan collins of maine, and lisa murkowski of alaska, immediately signaled the deep misgivings among some republicans over trumps tariff gambit, which has triggered a global sell-off. mcconnell, the former senate majority leader, issued a scathing denunciation after wednesday evenings vote, calling tariffs bad policy that would trigger economic hardship. trade wars with our partners hurt working people most, he said in a statement. tariffs drive up the cost of goods and services. they are a tax on everyday working americans. further criticism came from trumps former vice-president, mike pence, who called the tariffs the largest peacetime tax hike in us history. these tariffs are nearly 10 times the size of those imposed during the trump-pence administration, and will cost american families over 3,500 per year, he posted. the four republicans who voted with democrats did so despite a public appeal from trump not to support the resolution, tabled by tim kaine, a democratic senator for virginia who was hillary clintons running mate in the 2016 presidential election, which trump won. the resolution was aimed at curtailing the powers trump claimed under the international emergency economic powers act, which he has invoked to tackle the uss 1.2tn trade deficit and, in the case of canada, cited the influx of fentanyl through its border. mcconnell pulled no punches in his attack on trumps policy. preserving the long-term prosperity of american industry and workers requires working with our allies, not against them. with so much at stake globally, the last thing we need is to pick fights with the very friends with whom we should be working with to protect against chinas predatory and unfair trade practices, he said. he added at a time when americans are tightening their belts, we would do well to avoid policies that heap on the pain. we ought to strengthen our friendships abroad, and reinforce our allies as pillars of american prosperity and security. paul, his fellow kentuckian, said the tariffs were unconstitutional. our constitution was very specific that taxes tariffs are a tax taxes originate in the house, come to the senate and then go the president, he told reporters. they dont just go to the president and no one else. what kind of system would it be if all of our taxes and laws were passed by one person? he later told fox news trade is proportional to wealth. the last 70 years of international trade has been an exponential curve upwards, and the last 70 years of prosperity has been upwards also. we are richer because of trade with canada, and so is canada. collins, the senator for maine, said tariffs would damage lobstering, agriculture and the pulp and paper industries in her state, which borders canada. she also lambasted imposing tariffs on us allies. the fact is, the vast majority of fentanyl in america comes from the southern border rather than from canada, she said on the senate floor. one of my biggest concerns is we should be distinguishing between allies and our adversaries and not treating them the same way. murkowski, a senator from alaska, said tariffs would also hurt her state and urged trump to find a better way to mutually secure our borders and address fentanyl trafficking than by starting a trade war. while not all canadian trade practices are fair, im keenly aware of the negative impacts in store for alaskan families and businesses should tariffs drive up the costs of essential goods, she posted on x. in alaska we share more than 1,538 miles of border with canada. we are friends, neighbors, partners, and allies when it comes to our economies, our mutual defense, our cultures, and, yes, our trade. the outspoken republican criticism hinted at a wider unease in the party that is mostly being kept muted for fear of repercussions from trump. thom tillis, a republican senator for north carolina, warned about potential irreparable damage to his farming constituents before wednesdays announcement. anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right need to talk to my farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy, he told cnn. they dont have time. so weve got to be crisp on this implementation. john thune, the republican senate majority leader, tried to reconcile his concerns with loyalty to trump. ive got my issue. i represent a state that is very dependent upon exports, he told reporters. but i do appreciate the presidents focus on making sure were getting better deals, and giving business an incentive to do business here in the united states. such equivocation contrasted with unambiguous condemnation from democrats, some of whom openly lauded the republican anti-tariff rebels. this is what happens when people speak up, posted the new jersey senator, cory booker, citing images of news headlines about the four senators votes and obliquely referencing his record-breaking senate floor speech this week denouncing trumps policies. chuck schumer, the democratic leader in the senate, posted 54 tariffs on china, 10 tariffs on iran, 0 tariffs on russia alongside a puzzled emoji. brian schatz, a hawaii senator and the democrats chief whip, posted ive never seen a president ruin the economy on purpose. responding, chris murphy, the outspoken connecticut senator who has emerged as an articulate advocate of the need for a democratic anti-trump fightback, wrote this is the thing to understand. its all on purpose. creating chaos and crisis.

expanded trade penalties on steel and aluminum. trump has also imposed tariffs on countries that import oil from venezuela and he plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose have caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy, despite the risk of political backlash as voters in last years election said they wanted trump to combat inflation. senior administration officials, who insisted on anonymity to preview the new tariffs with reporters ahead of trumps speech, said the taxes would raise hundreds of billions of dollars annually in revenues. they said the 10 baseline rate existed to help ensure compliance, while the higher rates were based on the trade deficits run with other nations and then halved to reach the numbers that trump presented in the rose garden. in a follow-up series of questions by the associated press, the white house could not say whether the tariff exemptions on imports worth 800 or less would remain in place, possibly shielding some imports from the new taxes. based on the possibility of broad tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most outside analyses by banks and think tanks see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnating growth. trump would be applying these tariffs on

  Title: Trump Advisers Say 50-Plus Countries Have Reached Out for Tariff Talks With White House
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-06 18:32:26)
  Content: fort lauderdale, fla. ap top administration officials said sunday that more than 50 countries targeted by president donald trumps new tariffs have reached out to begin negotiations over the sweeping import taxes that have sent financial markets reeling, raised fears of a recession and upended the global trading system. the higher rates are set to be collected beginning wednesday, ushering in a new era of economic uncertainty with no clear end in sight. treasury secretary scott bessent said unfair trade practices are not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks. the united states, he said, must see what the countries offer and whether its believable. trump, who spent the weekend in florida playing golf, posted online that we will win. hang tough, it wont be easy. his cabinet members and economic advisers were out in force sunday defending the tariffs and downplaying the consequences for the global economy. there doesnt have to be a recession. who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week? bessent said. what we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity. trumps tariff blitz, announced april 2, fulfilled a key campaign promise as he acted without congress to redraw the rules of global trade. it was a move decades in the making for trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the u.s. he is gambling that voters will be willing to endure higher prices for everyday items to enact his economic vision. countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with china and others retaliating quickly. top white house economic adviser kevin hassett acknowledged that other countries are angry and retaliating, and, he said, by the way, coming to the table. he cited the office of the u.s. trade representative as reporting that more than 50 nations had reached out to the white house to begin talks. adding to the turmoil, the new tariffs are hitting american allies and adversaries alike, including israel, which is facing a 17 tariff. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is set to visit the white house monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion with trump along with the war in gaza and other issues. another american ally, vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs. trump said vietnams leader said in a telephone call that his country wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s. and a key european partner, italian premier giorgia meloni, said she disagreed with trumps move but was ready to deploy all the tools negotiating and economic necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized. commerce secretary howard lutnick made clear there was no postponing tariffs that are days away. the tariffs are coming. of course they, he said, adding that trump needed to reset global trade. but he committed only to having them definitely remain for days and weeks. in congress, where trumps republican party has long championed free trade, the tariff regiment has been met with applause but also significant unease. several republican senators have already signed onto a new bipartisan bill that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to congress. lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. wyomings john barrasso, the no. 2 member of the senates gop leadership, said trump is doing what he has every right to do. but, he acknowledged, there is concern, and theres concern across the country. people are watching the markets. therell be a discussion in the senate, barrasso said of the tariffs. well see which way the discussion goes. trumps government cost-cutting guru, billionaire businessman elon musk, had been relatively silent on trumps tariffs, but said at a weekend event in italy that he would like to see the u.s. and europe move to a zero-tariff situation. the comment from the tesla owner who leads trumps department of government efficiency drew a rebuke from white house trade adviser peter navarro. elon, when he is on his doge lane, is great. but we understand whats going on here. we just have to understand. elon sells cars, navarro said. he added hes simply protecting his own interest as any business person would do. lawrence summers, an economist who was treasury secretary under democratic president bill clinton, said trump and his economic team are sending contradictory messages if they say they are interested in reviving manufacturing while still being open to negotiating with trade partners. if other countries eliminate their tariffs, and the u.s, does, too, he said, its just making a deal, then we dont raise any revenue nor do we get any businesses to relocate to the united states. if its a permanent revenue source and trying to get businesses to relocate to the united states, then were going to have these tariffs permanently. so the president cant have it both ways. bessent was on nbcs meet the press, hassett and summers appeared on abcs this week, lutnick and barrasso were on cbs face the nation and navarro was interviewed on fox news channels sunday morning futures. ______ associated press writers giada zampano in rome and fatima hussein in jupiter, florida, contributed to this report. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: Harsh trade retaliation from Canada, China show challenge ahead for Trump team
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-08 21:32:32)
  Content: president trump holds up an executive order on energy production tuesday. the president has said he is waiting for talks to begin with china, the third-largest u.s. trading partner after canada and mexico. canada will begin imposing 25 tariffs on select u.s. car imports wednesday, ratcheting up tensions between washington and ottawa as the rest of the world grapples with president trumps ongoing assault on the global economic order. canadas move came hours after beijing vowed that china would fight to the end over the trump administrations tariff policy, which it characterized as an attempt to blackmail the world. as of wednesday, all products imported from china to the united states would face a duty of 104. the news led to yet another day of market turmoil, with the dow jones industrial average, standard poors 500 and nasdaq all beginning the day with promising rallies that disappeared by the closing bell. the steps from two of americas largest trading partners one friend, one foe exemplified the challenges ahead for the trump administration, which said that its sweeping global tariffs policy on nearly every country on earth would remain in place. only direct negotiations with trading partners, on an individual basis, could potentially result in new trade agreements that would lift or ease some restrictions, officials said. prime minister mark carney said tuesday that canadas new tariffs will go into effect at 1201 a.m. edt on noncompliant vehicles from the united states, and on contents of cusma-compliant vehicles not from canada or mexico. cusma, called usmca in the united states, refers to a trade agreement negotiated among canada, the united states and mexico during the first trump administration. the trade war is already reverberating through the auto industry, with jaguar, land rover and audi halting exports to the united states, and u.s.-based stellantis which produces brands including chrysler, dodge and jeep announcing an initial round of 900 temporary layoffs at five u.s. plants. president trump caused this trade crisis, carney said in a statement posted on x. canada is responding with purpose and with force. trump told reporters tuesday that he was doing very well in making tailored deals with countries around the world, and said that over 70 nations had reached out to the white house to start negotiations. he added that the u.s. is taking in almost 2 billion a day in tariffs. but trump has said he is waiting, in particular, for talks to begin with china, the third-largest u.s. trading partner after canada and mexico. on wednesday, the administration will push forward with trumps threat to pile on additional 50 tariffs if china does not remove its 34 tariffs against the united states. trump first announced 20 tariffs against china soon after taking office, complaining that the asian nation had forced fentanyl to flood into the country. last wednesday, as part of his sweeping tariffs measure he dubbed liberation day, trump enacted an additional 34 tariff against the country. white house officials continued to champion tariffs as the ultimate leverage, forcing other countries to line up to negotiate with the president. white house press secretary karoline leavitt repeated tuesday that the phones are ringing off the hook from global leaders, hoping to negotiate an end to the crippling taxes. its because the world knows that they need the united states of america. they need our markets. they need our consumers, leavitt said. the president has a lot of leverage on his side. not only is china the worlds largest trading partner, it is the provider of many goods americans rely on from iphone components to cheap clothing. already, members of trumps inner circle and the broader republican party are questioning the presidents tactics. elon musk, the presidents close advisor and the worlds richest man, who has several businesses with interests in china, complained in recent days on x, which he owns, about tariffs. he called trumps trade advisor, peter navarro, dumber than a sack of bricks over his guidance to the president. navarro is truly a moron, musk posted. what he says here is demonstrably false. several republican lawmakers, including prominent gop senators, initially responded to the policy change with draft legislation that would reassert congressional control over tariff policy. but senate majority leader john thune of south dakota threw cold water on the bills prospects monday. i dont think that has a future, thune said. the presidents indicated he would veto it. i dont see how they get it on the floor in the house, so i think at this point were kind of waiting to see whats going to happen next. the lack of congressional action leaves countries around the world with little choice but to directly negotiate with the trump administration. yet it is unclear what trump will consider adequate for success in any bilateral agreement, much less whether a common standard will emerge for countries entering talks. sitting in the oval office on monday, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said to the president, we will eliminate the trade deficit with the united states. israel has been hit with a 17 tariff rate by the trump administration, ostensibly over the countrys trade deficit with washington. california feds to look into potential fraud and corruption in southern california homeless funds the homelessness fraud and corruption task force will investigate potential fraud and corruption involving local homelessness funds, with u.s. atty. bill essayli saying there will be arrests if federal laws have been broken. we intend to do it very quickly we think its the right thing to do and were going to also eliminate trade barriers, netanyahu said. i think israel could serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same. and yet, in response to a reporters question moments later, trump would not commit to lifting the new tariff rate on israel even if netanyahu were to fulfill his promise. maybe not, trump said. dont forget, we help israel a lot, trump added. we give israel 4 billion a year, thats a lot. the remarks suggested that case-by-case talks with trading partners would involve topics well beyond tariffs, and even beyond trade deficits, to possibly include foreign aid, military assistance and other matters unrelated to economic policy a series of negotiations that could take months, if not years, to complete. kevin hassett, director of the national economic council under trump, said in an interview with fox news on tuesday that the administration is managing a massive amount of requests for negotiations. its actually, logistically, quite challenging, he added. trump announced a baseline tariff rate of 10 for nearly all countries last week. for countries with higher, customized tariff rates assigned based on the presidents belief that they have treated the united states unfairly the new import duties are scheduled to go into effect on wednesday morning. russia was not included on the list.

dollar-for-dollar tariffs on nations that levy duties on u.s. goods as part of an aggressive attempt to fulfill his administrations america first agenda and correct years of what he deems unfair trade. international markets wait tentatively as the president is expected to unveil his plans at 4 p.m. wednesday at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden at the moment american markets close. plans remain under wraps with trumps team reportedly weighing options through tuesday. however, white house press secretary karoline leavitt stated that the president had already decided his course of action and that the tariffs would go into effect almost immediately. the only way to avoid the new levies, she said, is to move production to the u.s. it follows the liberal candidate for a critical seat on the wisconsin supreme court, susan crawford, who defeated conservative brad schimel in a race seen as a referendum on trump and his billionaire adviser elon musk. former republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is on board with an effort by democrats in the upper chamber led by senators tim kaine, amy klobuchar, and mark warner to end donald trumps made-up emergency that the president has declared against canada allowing him authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on the u.s.s northern neighbor. trump claims the authority by declaring a national emergency caused by the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migration from canada as well as mexico and china. president trump is saying that there is an emergency with canada. canada is a friend, not an adversary. canada is a sovereign nation, not a 51st state, senator kaine of virginia said on tuesday. this morning, cnns haley talbot reports that the list of republicans who will vote yes on a tariffs resolution up for a vote today at around 7 p.m. has grown to include the former gop leader of the senate. kaine said he approached mcconnell last night and didnt even get to the question before the kentucky senator said im with you. other republicans in support of the move to at least symbolically rebuke the president on his trade policy just a few hours after his liberation day announcement on reciprocal tariffs expected to cover a large swathe of u.s. trading partners include senators susan collins, lisa murkowski, and rand paul. senator thom tillis also told cnn that he doesnt plan on voting for kaines resolution, but has some concerns with the trade policies being discussed, adding, we need to see what comes out tomorrow wednesday and be instructed by that before we take action. earlier, trump wrote in part on truth social mitch mcconnell of kentucky, susan collins of maine, lisa murkowski of alaska, and rand paul, also of kentucky, will hopefully get on the republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize canada for the sale, into our country, of large amounts of fentanyl, by tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy. they are playing with the lives of the american people, and right into the hands of the radical left democrats and drug cartels. the senate bill is just a ploy of the dems to show and expose the weakness of certain republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the house will never approve it and i, as your president, will never sign it. after breaking the record for the longest senate speech in history, cory booker now seems to have broken the internet, with a slew of praise, memes and even tiktok videos commemorating his mammoth achievement. the new jersey democrat took to the senate floor on monday evening, saying he would remain there as long as he was physically able. the speech lasted a whopping 25 hours and 5 minutes. mike bedigan looks at some of the online reactions. it was fitting that cory booker was recounting a story about the late civil rights leader john lewis as he entered the 19th minute and 24th hour of a historic speech to the senate on tuesday evening. in that moment, the first black senator for new jersey broke a record for the longest speech ever made in congress, one that was set 67 years ago by the segregationist democrat strom thurmond, who spoke for a day and a night in opposition to the civil rights act. overcome with emotion, booker looked up to the ceiling and touched his heart as his fellow democrats in the chamber applauded his effort. one of msnbcs morning joe hosts is delighting in the fact that the wisconsin supreme court candidate backed by elon musks lost - even after the tech mogul dumped millions into the race. wisconsin voters elected liberal justice susan crawford to the states supreme court on tuesday, beating brad schimel by more than 200,000 votes in the most expensive judicial election in u.s. history. the vote keeps the high courts 4-3 liberal majority intact. musk repeatedly played up the stakes of the election, claiming it will direct the destiny of humanity and the future of the world is at stake. now, morning joe host joe scarborough is reveling in the massive loss musk suffered. katie hawkinson reports from washington, d.c. the u.s. has sent a three-person team to myanmar to help respond to the 7.7-magnitude earthquake, in a move criticized as weak and irrelevant by a former aid official. much larger russian and chinese teams have already been helping search-and-rescue efforts in the country for days. steffie banatvala reports. a mother and her three children were wrongfully detained by immigration enforcement agents in new york and taken to a detention facility in texas, a nonprofit says as it calls for their release. immigration and customs enforcement officers detained the mother - whose birth country was not disclosed - and her kids, one of whom is in third grade, on march 27 while they were executing an arrest on a farm in sackets harbor, new york, according to the new york immigration coalition. kelly rissman reports. elon musk broke his silence after suffering defeat in the wisconsin supreme court race, which cemented a liberal majority for the next three years. susan crawfords win keeps the court under a 4-3 liberal majority in the face of crucial litigation surrounding abortion access, voting rights and redistricting. like president donald trump, musk chose to focus on the background win of wisconsin voters approving the constitutional amendment to enshrine voter id laws, a vote that was being held at the same time as the supreme court race. this was the most important thing, musk posted on x in response to a post on voter id. madeline sherratt has the full story. kelly loeffler, former georgia senator and now head of the small business administration in the trump administration, hailed donald trumps liberation day as the single greatest salvation, for not just small businesses, but for america, during an appearance on fox business this morning. the president eagerly posted a clip of her conversation with maria bartiromo to his truth social account italys prime minister giorgia meloni and the countrys top business lobby warned on wednesday that impending u.s. tariffs could significantly impact the nations exports and its already struggling economy. it is clear that the introduction of new tariffs would have heavy repercussions for italian producers, meloni said while hosting a prize-giving ceremony for italian cuisine in rome. meloni added that she did not rule out adequate responses to protect the exports of the euro zones third largest economy, though she did not provide further details. italy recorded a trade surplus with the united states of 39 billion euros 42.14 billion in 2024, the third largest in the 20-nation euro area, according to eurostat data. earlier on wednesday, the business association confindustria reported that italys economy is expected to grow by 0.6 this year, half of the governments official target and down from a 0.9 forecast made by the group in october. the economy expanded by a modest 0.7 in both 2024 and 2023. it managed to achieve 0.1 growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the previous three months, after stagnating in the third quarter. most analysts do not foresee any significant rebound in the near term. confindustria indicated that while its forecasts accounted for the already-announced u.s. tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as what it termed record levels of uncertainty regarding trade policy, they did not consider the effects of an escalating trade war. in a worst-case scenario, with permanent 25 u.s. tariffs on all imports, rising to 60 for china, coupled with retaliatory measures against u.s. exports, italys growth could decline to around 0.2 this year, it said. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Trump threatens more tariffs on China as global markets shudder over how much pain economy can take
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-10 20:33:10)
  Content: follow live updates on the global markets washington ap undeterred by a panicked stock market, president donald trump threatened additional tariffs on china on monday, raising fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war. trumps threat came after china said it would retaliate against u.s. tariffs he announced last week. if china does not withdraw its 34 increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, april 8th, 2025, the united states will impose additional tariffs on china of 50, effective april 9th, trump wrote on truth social. additionally, all talks with china concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! the u.s. president has shown few signs of backing down on tariffs despite the mounting pressure in the financial markets. his commitment to tariffs could have devastating effects for the global economy, even though trump is banking that it will ultimately pay off with manufacturing jobs. asked monday if he would consider a pause on his widespread tariffs, trump said, were not looking at that. the u.s. president said he was open to negotiations if we can make a really fair deal and a good deal for the united states. trump added that its possible to have both negotiated settlements with other countries and permanent tariffs. even as israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said his country would take its tariffs against u.s. goods to zero, trump was noncommittal about removing the new import taxes placed on an ally. the white house also said monday that trump would veto a senate bill that would mandate congressional approval for new tariffs, a bet that the critical mass of republican lawmakers will loyally back him despite the economic and political risks. however, there are signs of frustration even among trumps allies. sen. john kennedy, a louisiana republican, said he supports the presidents goals of better trade deals but worries about the economic uncertainty. we dont know if the medicine will be worse than the disease, kennedy said, adding, this is president trumps economy now. if trump implements his new taxes on imports from china, u.s. tariffs on chinese goods would reach a combined 104. the new taxes would be on top of the 20 tariffs announced as punishment for fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34 tariffs announced last week. not only could that increase prices for american consumers, it could also give china an incentive to flood other countries with cheaper goods and seek deeper relationships with other trading partners. china responded angrily and said it would not back down. the u.s. threat to escalate tariffs on china is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the u.s., said a statement from the commerce ministry in beijing. china will never accept this. if the u.s. insists on its own way, china will fight to the end. after sell-offs on the prior two days of trading, the dow jones industrial average on monday fell 0.9. the sp 500 slumped 0.2, and the nasdaq composite was up 0.1. trump frequently bragged about stock market gains during his first term, and the threat of losses on wall street was viewed as a potential guardrail on risky economic policies in his second term. but that hasnt been the case, and trump has described days of financial pain as necessary. i dont mind going through it because i see a beautiful picture at the end, he said. trump officials have frequently appeared on television to make the case for his policies, but none of their explanations have calmed the markets. the only improvement came from a false report that top economic adviser kevin hassett said trump was considering a pause on all tariffs except for china. stock prices spiked before the white house denied it was true by calling the post fake news. the republican president has remained defiant despite fears that he could be pushing the u.s. toward a recession, insisting that his tariffs are necessary for rebuilding domestic manufacturing and resetting trade relationships with other countries. but his aggressive push has scrambled u.s. economic policy. even though inflation remains elevated, trump has called on the federal reserve to lower its benchmark interest rates that were increased to constrain price increases. federal reserve chair jerome powell warned friday that the tariffs could increase inflation, and he said, theres a lot of waiting and seeing going on, including by us, before any decisions would be made. european commission president ursula von der leyen said the european union would focus on trade with other countries besides the united states, saying there are vast opportunities elsewhere. trump said he spoke with japanese prime minister shigeru ishiba to start trade negotiations. he complained on truth social they have treated the u.s. very poorly on trade and they dont take our cars, but we take millions of theirs. ishiba said he told trump that hes strongly concerned that tariffs would discourage investment from japan, which has been the worlds biggest investor in the u.s. in the past five years. he described the situation as a national crisis and said his government would negotiate with washington to urge trump to reconsider the tariffs. white house trade adviser peter navarro suggested countries would need to do much more than simply lower their own tariff rates to reach deals, an indication that talks could be a drawn-out process. lets take vietnam, he said on cnbc. when they come to us and say, well go to zero tariffs, that means nothing to us because its the non-tariff cheating that matters. meeting with trump at the white house on monday, netanyahu said his country would remove tariffs and other trade barriers in response to the u.s. placing 17 taxes on imports from israel. israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same, netanyahu told the u.s. president. trump said he appreciated very much what netanyahu had said. but when asked if he would remove the tariffs, trump said maybe not because of the aid that the united states provides to israel. the u.s. had a 7.4 billion trade deficit in goods last year with israel, according to the census bureau. trump has strived for a united front after the chaotic infighting of his first term. however, the economic turbulence has exposed some fractures among his supporters. bill ackman, a hedge fund manager, assailed commerce secretary howard lutnick on sunday as indifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing. on monday, ackman apologized for his criticism claiming that lutnick, previously the head of the financial firm cantor fitzgerald, could benefit from the tariffs because of its bond investments. but the hedge fund manager also reiterated his concerns about trumps tariffs. i am just frustrated watching what i believe to be a major policy error occur after our country and the president have been making huge economic progress that is now at risk due to the tariffs, he wrote on x. billionaire elon musk, a top adviser to trump on overhauling the federal government, expressed skepticism about tariffs over the weekend. musk has said that tariffs would drive up costs for tesla, his electric automaker. i hope it is agreed that both europe and the united states should move ideally in my view to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between europe and north america, musk said in a video conference with italian politicians. navarro later told fox news sunday morning futures that musk doesnt understand the situation. he sells cars, navarro said. thats what he does. he added, hes simply protecting his own interests as any businessperson would do. ___ associated press writers didi tang and stephen groves in washington and mari yamaguchi in tokyo contributed to this report. ___ follow the aps coverage of

  Content: donald trump, in announcing his sweeping new tariffs on us imports on wednesday, promised that the history books would record 2 april as americas liberation day. after two days of stock market turmoil, however, this may also be remembered as the week the presidents second-term agenda ran headfirst into economic - and political - reality. us stocks have been in a tailspin since trump unveiled his tariffs at wednesday afternoons white house rose garden event, with signs that americas trading partners - canada, the european union and china, most notably - are not backing away from a fight. meanwhile, other presidential efforts, on foreign policy and immigration, and at the ballot box - have faced notable setbacks in recent days. the white house on thursday felt a bit like a building battening down for a coming storm. the four big posters showing americas reciprocal tariffs on a long list of countries were on prominent display in the press briefing room, but administration officials available to respond to media questions were few and far between. out on pennsylvania avenue, workers unloaded pallets of metal fencing, which will ring the white house grounds in preparation for what officials anticipate to be a large anti-trump demonstration at the nearby washington monument on saturday. the first lady announced that a white house garden tour event that had been scheduled for that day was postponed because of security concerns. even the normally loquacious president stopped only briefly to talk with the crush of reporters on his way to board the marine one helicopter on the first leg of his journey to florida. i said this would be exactly the way it is, he declared when asked about the days stock market turmoil. the markets - and america as a whole - would soon boom, he said. the president, it seems, is willing to wait out the tempest created by his tariff plan. he appears confident that his economic vision of a rebuilt, job-rich american manufacturing sector protected from foreign competition - a vision he has closely held for decades - will ultimately be proven right. the trump agendas close encounter with cold, hard reality wasnt limited to trade this week, however. his two top foreign policy priorities - ending the wars in gaza and ukraine - both appear mired in the kind of messy details and conflicting agendas that often obstruct lasting peace. israel has once again moved into gaza and escalated a bombing campaign that is generating reports of widespread civilian casualties. the ceasefire that trump touted in the days before he took office appears to be in tatters. russia, meanwhile, continues to pile new conditions on to negotiations for a full ceasefire with ukraine, which is an indication that the nation may be buying time to allow its ground forces to take more territory. if i think theyre tapping us along, i will not be happy about it, trump said of russia. but he added that he still believes president vladimir putin wants to make a deal. evidence so far indicates the contrary, according to jake sullivan, who was president joe bidens national security adviser. in an interview with the bbc, he accused trump of handing russia most of its demands, though he acknowledged it was still early in the process and things could yet change. so the current dynamic in these negotiations a is not in fact producing russian willingness to reach a fair and just compromise, but b is actually stimulating a view in moscow that if they just keep holding out, theyre just going to keep getting concessions from the united states. and so far that is what has happened. even trumps deportation and immigration enforcement efforts, which still have high public support, have been at least partially derailed by legal challenges. while his administration has successfully completed several flights transferring alleged tren de aragua venezuelan gang members to an el salvadoran high-security prison, the judge presiding over a case challenging those deportations said on thursday there was a fair likelihood officials had violated his court order to turn the flights around. other court challenges - to trumps suspension of political asylum processing and refugee resettlement, his attempt to end birthright citizenship and his revocation of temporary protected status for about 350,000 venezuelans - are currently working their way through the us legal system. at some point, the us supreme court is expected to weigh in on many of these disputes. this week also marked the biggest round of elections since trumps november 2024 victory, as voters headed to the polls in wisconsin to elect a state judge and in two florida special elections for seats in the house of representatives. while the republican candidates in florida prevailed, their winning margins were about 15, which is about half of what trump posted in those congressional districts in november. in wisconsin, a key political battleground state, the democratic-backed candidate won. democrats were able to maintain the liberal majority on the court despite the tens of millions of dollars spent by conservative groups, including by tech billionaire elon musk, who campaigned there in person. taken as a whole the results suggest that democrats are doing well in hotly contested races and may be making inroads even in reliably conservative areas - in part by campaigning against musk and his efforts to massively cut federal programmes and staff. that could be an indication that the party will have the political wind at their backs in state elections this november and the midterm congressional elections next year. the stock market tumult, and those ballot-box results, may be behind a few scattered signs of dissent within republican ranks. ted cruz, an arch-conservative senator from texas, said on his podcast on friday that trumps tariffs could hurt jobs and could hurt america - particularly if other nations retaliate, as china has already done. if were in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now, with massive american tariffs, and massive tariffs on american goods in every other country on earth, that is a terrible outcome, he continued. on wednesday night in the us senate, four republicans joined with democrats to support rescinding the emergency declaration that justifies trumps earlier canada tariffs. and on thursday, republican senator chuck grassley of iowa joined with democrat maria cantwell of washington to back a measure that would require congress to directly approve tariffs that stay in effect longer than 60 days. republicans by and large have been sticking with the president. they seem unwilling, or unable, to sway trump from his current course on tariffs and government cuts and appear fearful of the political consequences of breaking with the man who has a vise-like grip on the party. but if the current economic shock becomes a long-term hardship, and if government programme cuts translate into tangible disruptions in popular services or if trumps standing in opinion polls continues to sag, members of his own party may begin eyeing the exit signs for the first time in years. and that would bring an unceremonious end to some of trumps most ambitious efforts. trump, no longer worried about standing before voters, may feel liberated from the immediate political consequences of his actions - but reality has a way of asserting itself in the end.

  Title: The World Reacts With Caution to US 'Reciprocal' Tariffs Against Dozens of Nations
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-02 22:55:26)
  Content: bangkok ap the sweeping new tariffs announced wednesday by u.s. president donald trump were met initially with measured reactions from key trading partners, highlighting the lack of appetite for a full-fledged trade war. trump presented the import taxes, which he calls reciprocal tariffs and range from 10 to 49, in the simplest terms the u.s. would do to its trading partners what he said they had been doing to the u.s. for decades. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, he said. but it is not going to happen anymore. the president promised that jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country. he framed it not just as an economic issue, but a question of national security that threatens our very way of life. financial markets were jolted, with u.s. stock futures down by as much as 3 early thursday and tokyos market leading losses in asia. oil prices sank more than 2 a barrel and the price of bitcoin dropped 4.4. nobody wants a trade war shortly after trumps announcement, the british government said the united states remains the u.k.s closest ally. business secretary jonathan reynolds said the u.k. hoped to strike a trade deal to mitigate the impact of the 10 tariffs on british goods announced by trump. nobody wants a trade war and our intention remains to secure a deal, said reynolds. but nothing is off the table and the government will do everything necessary to defend the u.k.s national interest. italys conservative premier giorgia meloni described the new 20 tariffs against the european union as wrong, saying they benefit neither side. we will do everything we can to work towards an agreement with the united states, with the aim of avoiding a trade war that would inevitably weaken the west in favor of other global players, meloni said in a facebook post. brazils government said it was considering taking the case to the world trade organization. and later, in a rare display of unity, brazils congress unanimously passed a reciprocity bill to allow its government to retaliate against any country or trade bloc that imposes tariffs on brazilian goods. no basis in logic some countries took issue with the white houses calculations. australian prime minister anthony albanese said the u.s. tariffs imposed on his country were totally unwarranted, but australia will not retaliate. president trump referred to reciprocal tariffs. a reciprocal tariff would be zero, not 10, said albanese. the u.s. and australia have a free trade agreement and the u.s. has a 2-to-1 trade surplus with australia. this is not the act of a friend. trump said the united states bought 3 billion of australian beef last year, but australia would not accept u.s. beef imports. albanese said the ban on raw u.s. beef was for biosecurity reasons. the 29 tariff imposed on the tiny south pacific outpost of norfolk island came as a shock. the australian territory has a population of around 2,000 people and the economy revolves around tourism. to my knowledge, we do not export anything to the united states, norfolk island administrator george plant, the australian governments representative on the island, told the ap thursday. we dont charge tariffs on anything. i cant think of any non-tariff barriers that would be in place either, so were scratching our heads here. new zealand also took issue with trumps tariff logic. we dont have a 20 tariff rate, said trade minister todd mcclay, adding that new zealand was a very low tariff regime and the correct figure was below the 10 baseline rate applied by the u.s. to all countries. we wont be looking to retaliate. that would put up prices on new zealand consumers and it would be inflationary, he said. spared for the moment from the latest round of tariffs were mexico and canada, so far as goods that already qualified under their free trade agreement with the united states. yet, the previously announced 25 tariffs on auto imports were scheduled to take effect at midnight. mexico president claudia sheinbaum said wednesday she would wait to take action on thursday when it was clear how trumps announcement would affect mexico. its not a question of if you impose tariffs on me, im going to impose tariffs on you, she said wednesday morning. our interest is in strengthening the mexican economy. canada had imposed retaliatory tariffs in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, imposed taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including bourbon, prompting trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. little to gain as trump read the list of countries that would be targeted wednesday, he repeatedly said he didnt blame them for the trade barriers they imposed to protect their own nations businesses. but were doing the same thing right now, he said. in the face of unrelenting economic warfare, the united states can no longer continue with a policy of unilateral economic surrender, trump said. speaking from a business forum in india, chilean president gabriel boric warned that such measures, in addition to causing uncertainty, challenge the mutually agreed rules and the principles that govern international trade. colombia president gustavo petro, who has clashed with trump before, said via x that the tariffs marked a global milestone today the neoliberalism that proclaimed free-trade policies all over the world has died. analysts say theres little to be gained from an all-out trade war, neither in the united states or in other countries. once again, trump has put europe at a crossroads, said matteo villa, senior analyst at italys institute for international political studies. if trump really imposes high tariffs, europe will have to respond, but the paradox is that the eu would be better off doing nothing, he added. villa also noted that retaliation would certainly be a further blow to the united states, but it would hurt europe even more, as the eu bloc depends more on exports to the u.s. than vice versa. on the other hand, trump seems to understand only the language of force, and this indicates the need for a strong and immediate response, villa said. probably the hope, in brussels, is that the response will be strong enough to induce trump to negotiate and, soon, to backtrack. __ ap journalists around the world contributed to this story. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: Congress Has the Power to Halt Trump's Tariffs. but Republicans Aren't Ready to Use It
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-04 18:41:37)
  Content: washington ap as stock markets tumble in the aftermath of president donald trumps sweeping tariffs, republicans in congress were watching with unease and talking of clawing back their power to levy tariffs but almost none seemed ready to turn their words into action. the republican president is upending longstanding gop principles like support for free trade, yet despite clear misgivings and a constitutional mandate to decide tariffs, most lawmakers were not ready to cross trump. instead, they were focusing all their attention on advancing the presidents big, beautiful bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, even as tariffs in essence, import taxes threatened to raise consumer prices across the board and push the global economy into a recession. as the fallout from trumps announcement reverberated around global markets, senate majority leader john thune, who has made it clear he is no fan of tariffs, told reporters that he would give trump the benefit of the doubt in hopes that the announcement was just a scare tactic to prod foreign leaders into negotiating better trade deals with the u.s. the president is a dealmaker if nothing else, and hes going to continue to deal country by country with each of them, said sen. john barrasso, a wyoming republican who is no. 2 in gop senate leadership. he added that treasury secretary scott bessent had told senate republicans this week that the tariffs announced by trump would be a high level mark with the ultimate goal of getting them reduced unless other countries retaliate. but countries like china are already retaliating with tariffs of their own, and while the president has signaled he is open to negotiations, he was mostly sounding a defiant tone friday, saying on social media that my policies will never change while claiming that foreign investors were lining up to invest in u.s. industries. he was on the golf course friday near his mar-a-lago private club in florida. congress, however, was jittery. a handful of republicans have rebuked trumps strategy as a foolhardy path that will burden u.s. households. kentucky sen. mitch mcconnell, the longtime senate leader who was the standard-bearer for past generations of republicans, released a lengthy statement saying, as i have always warned, tariffs are bad policy, and trade wars with our partners hurt working people most. mcconnell and three other republicans joined with democrats this week to help pass a resolution that would nullify trumps tariffs on canada, sending a rebuke to the president just hours after his liberation day announcement. but house speaker mike johnson quickly indicated he has no interest in giving the resolution a vote. lawmakers struggle to act showed the divide among republicans on trade policy, with a mostly younger group of republicans fiercely backing trumps strategy. rather than heed traditional free trade doctrine, they argue for america first protectionism and hope it will revive u.s. manufacturing. republican sen. josh hawley said that workers in his home state of missouri were absolutely thrilled with the tariffs. weve been losing jobs left and right. farmers want to see a fair deal for our products, both in canada and in mexico and from the european union, he added. for their part, democrats slammed trumps tariffs as a reckless maneuver meant to do nothing more than raise funds for the tax breaks trump and republicans are trying to pass. why would he raise the costs on american families by 5,000, as its estimated? simply because his very wealthy billionaire friends want a greater tax break, senate democratic leader chuck schumer said in a floor speech friday. other democrats challenged more republicans to stand up to trump. if they truly believe in capitalism, they need to put their votes where capitalism is and that is that competition works, our world relationships work, said sen. amy klobuchar, d-minn., at a news conference. donald trump is taking us backwards to the great depression, she added. sen. rand paul, a kentucky republican who holds libertarian economic views, has been highly critical of the tariffs, warning they create the same economic problems that exacerbated the great depression. he is calling for congress to reject trumps plans with legislation that would require congressional approval for taxes on imports. other republicans were looking for roundabout ways to check the presidents power on trade policy. sen. chuck grassley, a senior republican from iowa, introduced a bipartisan bill thursday that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to congress. lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. although grassley emphasized that he had long been working on the idea, the timing of the bill was notable. it gave republicans a chance to talk about their distaste for import taxes and raised the prospect of congress clawing back some of its power over tariffs. the constitution gives congress the responsibility of setting taxes and tariffs, but over the last century, lawmakers have ceded much of their power over import taxes to the president. a handful of republicans said they were favorable to grassleys proposal, though the idea of directly defying trump seemed to squelch potential for quick action. i dont want to do it in a politically charged environment, said sen. mike rounds, a south dakota republican. but i absolutely agree. this was set up by the founding fathers to be congresss role. and, i think were way past the point of what the founding fathers ever wanted to have happen. democratic sen. brian schatz seized on the hesitation from republicans, saying on social media friday that the senate would overwhelmingly repeal or constrain tariff authority if every senator voted their conscience and their states interest. mostly everyone hates this, they are just too afraid of the mad king at the moment, schatz added. sen. john kennedy, a louisiana republican, also predicted the bill would never pass because of the voting requirements in the senate. but he was still taking to social media to offer a folksy bit of advice tariffs are like whiskey a little whiskey, under the right circumstances, can be refreshing but too much whiskey, under the wrong circumstances, can make you drunk as a goat. ____ associated press writer kevin freking contributed 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Content: washington ap not even 24 hours after his party lost a key wisconsin race and underperformed in florida, president donald trump followed the playbook that has defined his political career he doubled down. trumps move wednesday to place stiff new tariffs on imports from nearly all u.s. trading partners marks an all-in bet by the republican that his once-fringe economic vision will pay off for americans. it was the realization of his four decades of advocacy for a protectionist foreign policy and the belief that free trade was forcing the united states into decline as its economy shifted from manufacturing to services. president donald trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the rose garden at the white house, wednesday, april 2, 2025, in washington. ap photomark schiefelbein the tariff announcement was the latest and perhaps boldest manifestation of trumps second-term freedom to lead with his instincts after feeling his first turn in the oval office was restrained by aides who did not share his worldview. how it shakes out could be a defining judgment on his presidency. the early reviews have been worrisome. financial markets had their worst week since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, foreign trade partners retaliated and economists warned that the import taxes may boost inflation and potentially send the u.s. into a recession. its now republican lawmakers who are fretting about their partys future while democrats feel newly buoyant over what they see as trumps overreach. a screen displays financial news as traders work on the floor at the new york stock exchange in new york, thursday, april 3, 2025. ap photoseth wenig mike pistillo jr., center, works with other traders on the floor at the new york stock exchange in new york, thursday, april 3, 2025. ap photoseth wenig democratic activists participated in rallies across the country saturday in the largest demonstrations since trump returned to office in january. the winds are changing, said rahna epting, who leads moveon, one of many organizing groups. he has promised that the taxes on imports will bring about a domestic manufacturing renaissance and help fund an extension of his 2017 tax cuts. he insisted thursday as the dow jones fell by 1,600 points that things were going very well and the economy would boom, then spent friday at the golf course as the index plunged 2,200 more points. the white house stayed the course saturday. this past november, america resoundingly rejected the business-as-usual policies coming out of d.c., said white house spokesman kush desai, adding, the entire trump administration is aligned on delivering on president trumps mandate to reject the status quo. a worker loads rolls of steel plate at a steel market in hangzhou in east chinas zhejiang province, monday, march 31, 2025. chinatopix via ap in his first term, trumps tariff threats brought world leaders to his door to cut deals. this time, his actions so far have led to steep retaliation from china and promises from european allies to push back. even some trump supporters are having their doubts. demonstrators hold up signs during a hands off!

  Title: Trump’s tariffs squeeze Republicans as they struggle to pass his agenda
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-04 23:51:54)
  Content: analysis trumps tariffs are making it harder for republicans to cut taxes and spending, eric garcia writes from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. if president donald trump hoped to get a better day on wall street two days after his massive tariff announcement, he was sorely mistaken. the dow jones industrial average closed on friday losing 2,231.07 points, or 5.50, another brutal dive. federal reserve chairman jerome powell spoke to journalists at a business reporters conference friday and while he did not comment on politics, he did offer a withering assessment of the effects of the tariffs. while uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth, powell said. trump nominated powell to lead the central bank in 2018, and powell earned such plaudits for the way he handled the economic fallout from the covid-19 pandemic that joe biden renominated him. but just before powell made his remarks, trump sent a message to the chairman via truth social. he is always late, but he could now change his image, and quickly, trump said on his social media platform. energy prices are down, interest rates are down, inflation is down, even eggs are down 69, and jobs are up, all within two months a big win for america. cut interest rates, jerome, and stop playing politics! trumps decision to wage a trade war came at a point that forced maximum pain for republicans and when his domestic agenda hangs in the balance. republicans historically have not liked tariffs and have supported free trade as part of their larger ideology that barriers to business stifle competition and kill jobs. trumps style of nationalism refuted that position, and his first speech as president denounced free trade deals. now republicans find themselves in a difficult place when they might need to defy trump for political and policy reasons. on wednesday, iowa senator chuck grassley, the senior-most republican, told the independent before trumps announcement that he worried the tariffs would drive up the cost of potash, which farmers use to grow soybeans and corn. that evening, four republicans lisa murkowski of alaska, susan collins of maine and kentuckys rand paul and mitch mcconnell- joined the democrats to pass legislation that would roll back trumps tariffs on canada. by thursday, grassley announced that he and democratic senator maria cantwell of washington would co-sponsor legislation that would require a president to explain the rationale and effects of new tariffs. the bill would also mandate that any new tariffs would expire without the approval of congress. grassley is not the only one sweating the effects of tariffs. senator ted cruz of texas, an archconservative who hails from a state that shares a border with mexico, warned on his podcast that the tariffs will raise the cost of automobiles immensely. its not just foreign cars that will go up all the american cars, their prices are going to go up, too, he said, adding that a manufacturer from one of the major automobile companies in the united states told him that by june, the price of american-made cars would jump by 4,500. all the while, republicans in the senate are hoping to begin the heavy lifting of passing trumps agenda. later on friday evening, the senate will begin a vote-a-rama for amendments to pass a budget resolution that would allow them to begin negotiating the details of the one, big, beautiful bill to drive through trumps domestic policy agenda. that would only be the beginning of the senates problems though. the committee for a responsible federal budget flagged that the proposed legislation would add almost 6 trillion to the debt with only a pittance of spending cuts. this will likely infuriate house republicans, whose budget resolution calls for 4.5 trillion in tax cuts only if the house finds 2 trillion worth of spending cuts. democrats have said that the 880 billion worth of spending cuts that the house energy and commerce committee needs to find would come out of medicaid. all of this comes as trumps proposed tariffs will eat away at americans wallets, and while their retirement savings get crushed in the stock market. as trumps approval rating continues to take a hit, republicans will feel a continued sense of urgency to pass his agenda, but that would make it even more politically unpopular. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Trump steps back from cliff edge of global trade war - BBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-10 00:17:31)
  Content: for days, donald trump and his white house team had insisted they were fully committed to their decision to impose sweeping reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries. they even derided a report on tuesday that said the president was considering a 90-day pause news that triggered a brief stock market surge. but now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality. the reordering of the global economic order is on hold, and trumps promise of a golden age of american manufacturing will have to wait. the white house has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along. weve had more than 75 countries contact us, and i imagine, after today, there will be more, treasury secretary scott bessent told reporters shortly after the announcement. that framing from the white house is not surprising, of course. and it is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market and growing chorus of republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement. so was it a strategic retreat in the face of unexpected resistance, or yet another example of trumps art of the deal negotiating strategy at work? it didnt take long for trumps aides many of the same people who said he would never back down to fan out and celebrate the presidents move. trade adviser peter navarro said trumps tariff situation unfolded exactly the way it should. you clearly failed to see what president trump is doing here, press secretary karoline leavitt told a crowd of gathered reporters. the entire world is calling the united states of america. they were less clear about the details of trumps tariff suspension, announced via a post on his truth social website. did the reprieve in higher tariffs apply to the eu? were mexico and canada, which had avoided the original 10 baseline tariffs, somehow now included? were tariffs targeting specific sectors affected? ultimately, the white house provided some clarity on these questions but for hours us trading partners were left to scrutinise trumps truth social post and glean details from answers to questions shouted by reporters at press gaggles. on wednesday afternoon, trump acknowledged that the markets had looked pretty glum and that people were getting a little queasy a reflection that undercut some of the bravado he expressed over the past week and could hint at the real reason for his tariff change of course. earlier in the day, he was on truth social, urging people to be cool! and promising that everything is going to work out. and on monday he lashed out at what he called panicans - a party based on weak and stupid people who werent patient with his efforts. in the end, it was trump who made an abrupt change of course. he insisted, however, that his tariff announcement was one that had to be made, and that any economic disruptions reflected a sickness that had been allowed to fester in the american economy. democrats, meanwhile, painted a less rosy picture. senate minority leader chuck schumer accused trump of governing by chaos. he is reeling, he is retreating, and that is a good thing, he said. in the end, the thought process behind trumps decision may not really matter. the reality is that the us is now making nice or at least nicer - with nations that had faced their retaliatory trade fire, even though trump is still imposing a 10 across the board tariff that by itself would have been huge news just a few weeks ago. it is enough of a step down for the stock market to bounce back, however, and trump is now leaning into a trade war with china which he hit with 125 tariffs. that will have global economic repercussions of its own, but it is more in line with recent american foreign policy - including that of democratic president joe biden - as it seeks to constrain chinese ambitions. the big unknown, however, is whether trumps actions over the past week setting allies scrambling and threatening the established global order will have made such a strategy more difficult to pursue. and in 90 days, when trumps pause expires, this weeks economic drama and uncertainty could begin all over again. follow the twists and turns of trumps second term with north america correspondent anthony zurchers weekly us politics unspun newsletter. readers in the uk can sign up here. those outside the uk can sign up here. six people have been confirmed to have died following the crash near to the new jersey side of the hudson. the us government admitted kilmar abrego garcia was deported to el salvador due to administrative error. five of the individuals on board were a family of tourists from spain and the sixth person was the pilot, officials say. news of the us presidents plan to halt higher-band taxes came as a surprise on wednesday, but was it part of a plan?

  Title: Senior Trump officials give conflicting lines on tariffs after markets turmoil
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-06 17:37:32)
  Content: senior officials within donald trumps administration officials gave conflicting messages on sunday about the us presidents global tariffs that have caused a meltdown in stock markets, prompted warnings of a world recession and provoked rare expressions of dissent from within his republican party. cabinet members fanned out across sundays political talk shows armed with talking points on trumps 10 across-the-board tariff on almost all us imports, with higher rates targeted at about 60 countries. if the intention was to calm nerves with a clear statement of intent, then it backfired as top officials gave starkly contrasting signals. howard lutnick, the billionaire commerce secretary, struck an aggressive note on cbs newss face the nation in which he portrayed the tariffs as here to stay. asked whether there was a chance that tariffs would be postponed to allow countries to negotiate a deal with washington, he replied there is no postponing they are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks, that is sort of obvious. lutnick added that trump intended to reset global trade. the president has made it crystal, crystal clear, he said. however, two other cabinet members gave the opposite take, suggesting that negotiations with individual countries were very much on the cards. scott bessent, the treasury secretary, told meet the press on nbc news that trump had created maximum leverage for himself, and more than 50 countries have approached the administration about lowering their non-tariff trade barriers, lowering their tariffs, stopping currency manipulation. the agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, echoed bessent by flagging up possible talks. weve got 50 countries that are burning the phone lines into the white house, she told cnns state of the union. the scale of trumps tariffs have sent shockwaves around the world, catching us investors as well as top republican politicians by surprise. in just two days last week, more than 6tn was wiped off wall streets market value. trump told us consumers in a post on his truth social network to hang tough, it wont be easy, but the end result will be historic. yet as he spent the weekend golfing at his mar-a-lago resort in florida, his unprecedented tax increase goaded senior republicans to speak out, in a vanishingly rare display of criticism of their leader. trumps former vice-president, mike pence, denounced the tariffs as the largest peacetime tax hike in us history. thom tillis, the republican senator from north carolina, said anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right needs to talk to farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy. ted cruz, a senator from texas, warned of a bloodbath for republicans in the 2026 midterm elections should the tariffs force the us into recession. democrats are detecting opportunity in such unusual challenges to trump from within his own party. adam schiff, the democratic senator from california, floated on meet the press what sounded like a draft campaign strategy for the midterms. if we head into a recession, it will be the trump recession, he said. of trump, schiff also said hes wrecking our economy. tim walz, the governor of minnesota who ran as the democrats vice-presidential candidate in last novembers defeat to trump, called the tariffs really, really terrifying on state of the union. he warned that if you punish dependable trading partners like mexico and canada, they dont come back overnight. as the tariffs kick in, analysts are increasingly pointing to the chances of a recession, which is normally assessed as being two consecutive quarters of falling gdp. the head of economic research at jp morgan, bruce kasman, has raised the probability of global recession to 60, a figure that he included in a memo titled there will be blood. larry summers, the us treasury secretary during bill clintons presidency, called the tariffs the biggest self-inflicted wound weve put on our economy in history. speaking on abc newss this week, he gave his own estimate of the total loss to us consumers at 30tn equivalent to doubling petrol prices at the pump. skip past

attempted to use rhetorical devices as a way of assuaging rattled investors and consumers. rollins said the markets werent crashing they were adjusting. asked what he would say to americans close to retirement who had just watched their lifetime savings drop significantly in recent days, bessent called that a false narrative. americans who want to retire right now, they dont look at the day-to-day fluctuations of whats happening, bessent said. bessents answer was coloured, perhaps, by his own net worth, which has been put at more than 521m. there were moments of the surreal in the exchanges between trumps top officials and the political show hosts. asked by cnns jake tapper why 10 tariffs had been placed on heard island and mcdonald islands, which are populated by penguins near antarctica but no humans, rollins said i mean, come on, whatever. listen, the people that are leading this are serious, intentional, patriotic the smartest people ive ever worked with. tapper then pushed back on the agriculture secretarys justification for the 20 reciprocal tariffs that have been imposed on eu goods sold to the us. rollins said that honduras bought more pork from the us than the entire european union. tapper pointed out that the eu had tight restrictions on hormone use in livestock production. the eu banned use of synthetic hormones in 1981, and blocked imports of animals that had been treated in that way. rollins then accused the eu of using fake science to prohibit us products. thats just absolute bull, she said. we produce the safest, the most secure, the best food in the world.

  Content: billionaire elon musk said saturday he hoped in the future the united states and europe could create a very close, stronger partnership and reach a zero-tariff zone. he made his remarks via videolink to delegates at italys league partys congress in florence. president donald trump returns to his mar-a-lago club from trump national golf club, sunday, april 6, 2025, in west palm beach, fla. ap photoalex brandon from left, treasury secretary scott bessent, health and human services secretary robert f. kennedy jr. and commerce secretary howard lutnick follow president donald trump to board marine one on the south lawn of the white house en route to florida, friday, march 28, 2025, in washington. ap photomark schiefelbein commerce secretary howard lutnick holds a chart as president donald trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the rose garden at the white house, wednesday, april 2, 2025, in washington. ap photomark schiefelbein white house trade adviser peter navarro arrives before president donald trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the rose garden of the white house, wednesday, april 2, 2025, in washington. ap photoevan vucci president donald trump meets with israels prime minister benjamin netanyahu in the oval office of the white house, feb. 4, 2025, in washington. ap photoevan vucci, file italian premier giorgia meloni arrives in st. peters basilica at the vatican to attend a mass presided over by archbishop rino fisichella, wednesday, april 2, 2025, for late saint pope john paul ii on the 20th anniversary of his death. ap photogregorio borgia fort lauderdale, fla. ap top administration officials said sunday that more than 50 countries targeted by president donald trumps new tariffs have reached out to begin negotiations over the sweeping import taxes that have sent financial markets reeling, raised fears of a recession and upended the global trading system. the higher rates are set to be collected beginning wednesday, ushering in a new era of economic uncertainty with no clear end in sight. treasury secretary scott bessent said unfair trade practices are not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks. the united states, he said, must see what the countries offer and whether its believable. trump, who spent the weekend in florida playing golf, posted online that we will win. hang tough, it wont be easy. his cabinet members and economic advisers were out in force sunday defending the tariffs and downplaying the consequences for the global economy. there doesnt have to be a recession. who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week? bessent said. what we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity. trumps tariff blitz, announced april 2, fulfilled a key campaign promise as he acted without congress to redraw the rules of global trade. it was a move decades in the making for trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the u.s. he is gambling that voters will be willing to endure higher prices for everyday items to enact his economic vision. countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with china and others retaliating quickly. top white house economic adviser kevin hassett acknowledged that other countries are angry and retaliating, and, he said, by the way, coming to the table. he cited the office of the u.s. trade representative as reporting that more than 50 nations had reached out to the white house to begin talks. adding to the turmoil, the new tariffs are hitting american allies and adversaries alike, including israel, which is facing a 17 tariff. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is set to visit the white house monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion with trump along with the war in gaza and other issues. another american ally, vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs. trump said vietnams leader said in a telephone call that his country wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s. and a key european partner, italian premier giorgia meloni, said she disagreed with trumps move but was ready to deploy all the tools negotiating and economic necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized. commerce secretary howard lutnick made clear there was no postponing tariffs that are days away. the tariffs are coming. of course they, he said, adding that trump needed to reset global trade. but he committed only to having them definitely remain for days and weeks. in congress, where trumps republican party has long championed free trade, the tariff regiment has been met with applause but also significant unease. several republican senators have already signed onto a new bipartisan bill that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to congress. lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. wyomings john barrasso, the no. 2 member of the senates gop leadership, said trump is doing what he has every right to do. but, he acknowledged, there is concern, and theres concern across the country. people are watching the markets. therell be a discussion in the senate, barrasso said of the tariffs. well see which way the discussion goes. trumps government cost-cutting guru, billionaire businessman elon musk, had been relatively silent on trumps tariffs, but said at a weekend event in italy that he would like to see the u.s. and europe move to a zero-tariff situation. the comment from the tesla owner who leads trumps department of government efficiency drew a rebuke from white house trade adviser peter navarro. elon, when he is on his doge lane, is great. but we understand whats going on here. we just have to understand. elon sells cars, navarro said. he added hes simply protecting his own interest as any business person would do. lawrence summers, an economist who was treasury secretary under democratic president bill clinton, said trump and his economic team are sending contradictory messages if they say they are interested in reviving manufacturing while still being open to negotiating with trade partners. if other countries eliminate their tariffs, and the u.s, does, too, he said, its just making a deal, then we dont raise any revenue nor do we get any businesses to relocate to the united states. if its a permanent revenue source and trying to get businesses to relocate to the united states, then were going to have these tariffs permanently. so the president cant have it both ways. bessent was on nbcs meet the press, hassett and summers appeared on abcs this week, lutnick and barrasso were on cbs face the nation and navarro was interviewed on fox news channels sunday morning futures. associated press writers giada zampano in rome and fatima hussein in jupiter, florida, contributed to this report.

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
