  Title: UN researchers warn that Asian scam operations are spreading across the rest of the world
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-21 15:23:50)
  Content: bangkok ap transnational organized crime groups in east and southeast asia are spreading their lucrative scam operations across the globe in response to increased crackdowns by authorities, according to a u.n. report issued on monday. for several years, scam compounds have proliferated in southeast asia, especially in border areas of cambodia, laos and myanmar, as well as in the philippines, shifting operations from site to site to stay a step ahead of the police. more recently, scam centers that have bilked victims out of billions of dollars through false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes are now being reported operating as far afield as africa and latin america. asian crime syndicates have been expanding operations deeper into remote areas with lax law enforcement that are vulnerable to the influx, according to the report issued by the u.n. office on drugs and crime or unodc. the report is titled inflection point global implications of scam centers, underground banking and illicit online marketplaces in southeast asia. this reflects both a natural expansion as the industry grows and seeks new ways and places to do business, but also a hedging against future risks should disruption continue and intensify in southeast asia, benedikt hofmann, unodcs acting regional representative for southeast asia and the pacific, said in a statement. unodc estimates that hundreds of industrial-scale scam centers generate just under 40 billion in annual profits. the trend to hedge beyond the region has been consistent with continued reports of crackdowns targeting asian-led scam centers that have been found operating in africa, south asia, the middle east and select pacific islands, as well as related money laundering, people trafficking and recruitment services discovered in europe, north america and south america. in africa, nigeria has become a hot spot, with police raids in late 2024 and early 2025 leading to many arrests, including people from east and southeast asia suspected of cryptocurrency and romance scams. zambia and angola have also busted asian-linked cyberfraud operations. in latin america, the report says that its notable that brazil has emerged as one country that has faced a growing set of challenges related to cyber-enabled fraud, online gambling, and related money laundering, with some linkages to criminal groups operating in southeast asia. it also notes that in late 2023 in peru, more than 40 malaysians were rescued after being trafficked by a taiwan-based gang known as the red dragon syndicate that forced them to commit cyber-enabled fraud. the report also points to crackdowns on asian-led scam centers in the middle east and some pacific islands. alarmingly, even as asian-led groups have been expanding the geographical scope of their operations, the involvement of criminal groups from other parts of the world is also growing, the report says. new online markets, money laundering networks, stolen data products, malware, artificial intelligence and deepfake technologies are laying the ground for the rise of crime as a service, the report says. these technological innovations facilitate conducting their businesses online and adapt to crackdowns. the convergence between the acceleration and professionalization of these operations on the one hand and their geographical expansion into new parts of the region and beyond on the other translates into a new intensity in the industry one that governments need to be prepared to respond to, hofmann says.

  Title: Spain unveils €11bn plan to reach long-delayed Nato defence spending target
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-22 13:24:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: Spain's increased defense spending, spurred by pressure from NATO and the perceived threat from Russia ('vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security'), aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize their security in an anarchic international system. This action demonstrates a shift towards self-reliance and power balancing within Europe.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Spain's commitment to increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP, but also mentions criticism from coalition partners who describe the plans as 'incoherent and absolutely exorbitant.' This suggests internal political divisions regarding defense priorities and resource allocation. What are the specific concerns of the coalition partners, and how might these internal disagreements affect the implementation and effectiveness of the defense plan?

      > Snippet: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year
  Content: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year, saying it has become obvious only europe will know how to protect europe from now on. the country which lags well behind other western nations by dedicating about 1.3 of its gdp to defence spending is one of the nato members that has been pressured by the trump administration to increase its spending, and had previously committed to hitting the 2 threshold by 2029. but speaking on tuesday morning, spains prime minister, pedro sánchez, unveiled a 10.5bn 9bn industrial and technological plan for security and defence that will allow spain to meet the 2 commitment in 2025. sánchez said the plan, which has been approved by his cabinet and will now be submitted to the eu and nato, was needed to address the current and future defence challenges. its main focus will be telecommunications, cybersecurity and buying military equipment. the enemies of europe are not just using missiles as we have seen in ukraine over the past three years, he said. theyre also using unmanned drones and paramilitary forces to sabotage supply chains and to cut gas lines and underwater cables. theyre using social networks to issue disinformation and to polarise people and spread disaffection towards democratic institutions. theyre using ai cyber-attacks and quantum computers to compromise out telecommunications, our supply networks, and our public services in order to target our way of life. the prime minister who pointed out that his administration was finally making good on the 2 commitment pledged by its conservative predecessor in 2014 said the new plan would help reinforce european security in record time. in a world thats dominated by uncertainty, europe is hope and it is certainty and that certainty must be protected by strengthening our security and defence systems because given whats going on, its obvious that only europe will know how to protect europe, he added. and spain will contribute to protecting europe. sánchez said vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security, no matter how far any eu member state was from the frontlines of the conflict in ukraine. the security and stability of ukraine, of eastern europe and the baltic and nordic countries, is also the security and the safety of spain, he said. the people who live in those countries know that putin is serious and that his words are backed by deeds and thats why they look to europe for protection. theyre looking for something important, and that is unity. spain will not be indifferent to that demand. ukraine resists, europe responds and spain fulfils its obligations. sánchez also repeated his assurances that the additional spending would not lead to increased taxes, raids on the welfare state budget, or deficit increases. the plan has faced criticism from coalition partners in the leftwing sumar platform, who described the plans as incoherent and absolutely exorbitant. in january, donald trump increased pressure on nato, claiming the us had shouldered the global defence burden for too long and saying he would ask all nato members to increase defence spending to 5 of gdp. the nato secretary-general, mark rutte, has urged member states to use the threats from washington as an incentive to take unilateral action on raising defence contributions. last month, rutte said the pressure was already paying off in countries such as spain, portugal, belgium and italy. i tell them that, well, now i am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2 by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2 because we have to spend much, much more than 2 but now i am calling you, but you might get a very, erm, patient man from washington on the line if you dont listen to me, he said.

  Title: The Brief – Macron’s Mayotte mission
  Source: www.euractiv.com (2025-04-22 16:09:22)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article highlights France's struggle to maintain its global power projection through its overseas territories amidst rising challenges from regional powers like China and potential interference from the US. This aligns with Realism's emphasis on states pursuing their national interests in a competitive international environment. The text states, "as the pacific becomes a key arena for the looming confrontation between china and the united states, beijing is closely monitoring developments in frances regional territories," demonstrating the power dynamics at play. This suggests that France's actions are driven by a desire to maintain its influence and security in the face of external threats, a core tenet of Realism.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Macron's promise of 3.2 billion over six years to Mayotte, but also notes the "chronic under-equipment of french armed forces." This juxtaposition raises questions about resource allocation priorities. Is France prioritizing short-term economic relief over long-term strategic defense capabilities in its overseas territories? What are the potential consequences of this imbalance for France's ability to project power and maintain sovereignty in these regions?; Intriguing_angles: The article frames the EU as a potential solution for managing France's overseas territories, suggesting a "shared destiny between the old continent and its most distant outposts?" However, it also acknowledges that these territories are subject to different legal frameworks within the EU. This raises the question of whether the EU is truly equipped to address the unique challenges and needs of these diverse territories, or if this is simply a way for France to offload its responsibilities.

in an excellent issue of politique étrangère, journalist richard werly paints a stark picture of the fragility of frances position in its overseas territories. the time will come when france will be forced to reconsider its ties and authority over departments and territories it can no longer, or no longer wishes to, manage, he writes, suggesting that their economic viability and political future should be debated at the eu level. under the 2009 lisbon treaty, the eus outermost regions are integrated into the common market and subject to a legal framework that is almost identical to that of other european regions. the overseas countries and territories, such as greenland, are not part of the eu but have associate status, although their citizens hold eu passports. would it not be justified, werly asks, to make these territories a strategic priority for europe not as a dominating or imperial power, but as proof of a shared destiny between the old continent and its most distant outposts? protecting these territories could thus form the distant embryo of an autonomous european defence. pending any meaningful progress at the european level, french prime minister françois bayrou had, upon his appointment last december, made the overseas territories one of his top priorities. the reconstruction of mayotte and the management of the crisis in new caledonia will determine whether paris still has the legitimacy to offer a future-oriented project to the populations of its overseas lands. tech the commission is assessing googles use of ai summaries at the top of its search results under the digital markets act dma and eu law, amid a broader structural clash over ai-aided internet services. ceasefire talks russia shelled five ukrainian regions within hours of a promised easter truce, reviving a familiar pattern of broken ceasefire deals that now looms over this weeks latest round of talks. the vatican pope francis died on monday in the middle of the churchs jubilee year. now, the vatican faces an awkwardly literal question who gets to close the year?

  Title: Trump's Reconfiguration Of Global Conflict: What It Means For Asia And Europe
  Source: www.zerohedge.com (2025-04-03 02:35:00)
  Content: authored by joseph yizheng lian via the epoch times, two months into his second term, president donald trump was accused by some politicians in the west of abandoning washingtons longstanding allies as a result of his stance on the war in ukraine. but one doesnt have to look very far back in history to note that a similar act of unfriending had occurred from continental europe and wasnt unjustified. in 1988, the late british prime minister lady margaret thatcher, speaking at the college of europe in bruges, belgium, advised her audience thus we must strive to maintain the united states commitment to europes defence. and that means recognising the burden on their resources of the world role they undertake and their point that their allies should bear the full part of the defence of freedom, particularly as europe grows wealthier. unfortunately, those mild words of the iron lady fell on deaf ears. eleven years later, her tone had changed into one of disdain and spite, when in a conservative party conference in blackpool she shockingly declared, in my lifetime all the problems have come from mainland europe, and all the solutions have come from the english-speaking nations across the world. between bruges and blackpool, thatcher morphed from a 30-year supporter of european integration into a fierce opponent. she decried the british malaisea term used by conservative politician and historian sir ian gilmour in his 1969 book the body politicto characterize the economic stagnation, the social decline, and the sense of futility and hopelessness that seemed to pervade british society. thatcher abhorred the european welfare state, criticized intransigent unionism, and loathed the power wielded by unelected brussels bureaucrats, who had virtually forgotten nato by the mid-1990s, even though europe had grown rich. she won her battle posthumously, in 2020 brexit. u.s. president ronald reagan and british prime minister margaret thatcher pose for photographers on the patio outside the oval office in washington on july 17, 1987. mike sargentafp via getty images since then, primarily by default, britain has gone out of europe and built partnerships in the indopacific, a region that it is historically familiar with, signed bilateral free trade agreements japan, south korea, australia, new zealand, and is in talks for new ones with the united states and india. the uk has recently gained membership in the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-pacific partnership, or cptpp. the new labour government has not tried to bend back the arc. the united states is on a similar trajectory. trump also spurns big government and bureaucratic multinational agencies. like thatcher almost 40 years agobut much more vehementlyhe has criticized other nato countries for spending far too little on defensea constant gripe of u.s. presidents, especially dwight eisenhower and ronald reagan. trumps associates readily criticized certain european countries for abandoning basic western values, such as adopting free speech, abolishing secure national borders, and letting in gangsters and fanatical jihadis who unleash terrorist attacks on innocent citizens. trump also thinks all these are happening in the united states. the russiaukraine war has caused rifts between trump and other nato members. he wants the war to end so that washington can pivot to the indopacific to squarely face the pacing threat of communist china, which he, since his first term, has rightly regarded as americas major adversary. so, almost simultaneously, the two major english-speaking countries, the united states and the uk, are extricating themselves from entanglements in europe and reaching out to asia. their leaving europe to enter asia is going full circle from the time when japans most famous 19th century reformist, fukuzawa yukichi, advocated the opposite, leaving asia to enter europe 1885, under very different circumstances. if u.s. commodore matthew perrys arrival in tokugawa japan in 1853 and world war ii marked the first and second historic coming of america to asia, respectively, then the trump pivot may well be the third. it could add enormously to the prosperity in indopacific ex-china, for two reasons. first, as the u.s.china decoupling continues, much american money leaving china will go into other indopacific economies. second, when greater american military might, coupled with increased defense spending and capabilities in east asian countries, is realized under trumps pressures, it will be deployed to contain the chinese regime and achieve greater regional stability, and new investment money will arrive with more confidence. but then what about europe, which the united states and perhaps britain are leaving behind? it will do fine, but in a previously unexpected way. this will be the scenario trump 2.0 will continue to goad europe to pony up for its own defense, necessarily at the expense of its welfare state, climate policy, and open borders, and damage the transatlantic relationship if it must. trump will be much maligned in the process. for example, a recent bbc article accused the u.s. president of blowing up the world order. but that is sheer eurocentrism, because trump is merely resetting washingtons relationship with europe and europe is not the whole world. in fact, there are good signs that europe is reacting to trump in a healthy way for example, the newly elected german leader has decided that germany must spend huge amounts in upgrading its military, notwithstanding that it necessarily will have to cut welfare spending and retune its growth model. expectedly, when europe is strong and wholesome again, trump will be gone from the stage and his successors will be able to mend fences with all obstacles removed. at that point, the world will still be essentially bipolar the open society camp versus the authoritarian-or-worse camp. there will be two main theaters where the conflict between the two camps will be played out. first is asia, in which the united statesrid of its european baggage and in some kind of alliance with japan, taiwan, south korea, and australiawill face off against the chinese regime. the mightiest power on earth will try to roll back and contain the most dangerous. next is europe, where a reformed and repowered european union will take on russia. a second-rate power will try to keep a third-rate one in check. it will be a much more rational conflict configuration and manageable division of labor for the west than it is now. views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the epoch times or zerohedge.

  Content: authored by joseph yizheng lian via the epoch times, two months into his second term, president donald trump was accused by some politicians in the west of abandoning washingtons longstanding allies as a result of his stance on the war in ukraine. but one doesnt have to look very far back in history to note that a similar act of unfriending had occurred from continental europe and wasnt unjustified. in 1988, the late british prime minister lady margaret thatcher, speaking at the college of europe in bruges, belgium, advised her audience thus we must strive to maintain the united states commitment to europes defence. and that means recognising the burden on their resources of the world role they undertake and their point that their allies should bear the full part of the defence of freedom, particularly as europe grows wealthier. unfortunately, those mild words of the iron lady fell on deaf ears. eleven years later, her tone had changed into one of disdain and spite, when in a conservative party conference in blackpool she shockingly declared, in my lifetime all the problems have come from mainland europe, and all the solutions have come from the english-speaking nations across the world. between bruges and blackpool, thatcher morphed from a 30-year supporter of european integration into a fierce opponent. she decried the british malaisea term used by conservative politician and historian sir ian gilmour in his 1969 book the body politicto characterize the economic stagnation, the social decline, and the sense of futility and hopelessness that seemed to pervade british society. thatcher abhorred the european welfare state, criticized intransigent unionism, and loathed the power wielded by unelected brussels bureaucrats, who had virtually forgotten nato by the mid-1990s, even though europe had grown rich. she won her battle posthumously, in 2020 brexit. u.s. president ronald reagan and british prime minister margaret thatcher pose for photographers on the patio outside the oval office in washington on july 17, 1987. mike sargentafp via getty images since then, primarily by default, britain has gone out of europe and built partnerships in the indopacific, a region that it is historically familiar with, signed bilateral free trade agreements japan, south korea, australia, new zealand, and is in talks for new ones with the united states and india. the uk has recently gained membership in the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-pacific partnership, or cptpp. the new labour government has not tried to bend back the arc. the united states is on a similar trajectory. trump also spurns big government and bureaucratic multinational agencies. like thatcher almost 40 years agobut much more vehementlyhe has criticized other nato countries for spending far too little on defensea constant gripe of u.s. presidents, especially dwight eisenhower and ronald reagan. trumps associates readily criticized certain european countries for abandoning basic western values, such as adopting free speech, abolishing secure national borders, and letting in gangsters and fanatical jihadis who unleash terrorist attacks on innocent citizens. trump also thinks all these are happening in the united states. the russiaukraine war has caused rifts between trump and other nato members. he wants the war to end so that washington can pivot to the indopacific to squarely face the pacing threat of communist china, which he, since his first term, has rightly regarded as americas major adversary. so, almost simultaneously, the two major english-speaking countries, the united states and the uk, are extricating themselves from entanglements in europe and reaching out to asia. their leaving europe to enter asia is going full circle from the time when japans most famous 19th century reformist, fukuzawa yukichi, advocated the opposite, leaving asia to enter europe 1885, under very different circumstances. if u.s. commodore matthew perrys arrival in tokugawa japan in 1853 and world war ii marked the first and second historic coming of america to asia, respectively, then the trump pivot may well be the third. it could add enormously to the prosperity in indopacific ex-china, for two reasons. first, as the u.s.china decoupling continues, much american money leaving china will go into other indopacific economies. second, when greater american military might, coupled with increased defense spending and capabilities in east asian countries, is realized under trumps pressures, it will be deployed to contain the chinese regime and achieve greater regional stability, and new investment money will arrive with more confidence. but then what about europe, which the united states and perhaps britain are leaving behind? it will do fine, but in a previously unexpected way. this will be the scenario trump 2.0 will continue to goad europe to pony up for its own defense, necessarily at the expense of its welfare state, climate policy, and open borders, and damage the transatlantic relationship if it must. trump will be much maligned in the process. for example, a recent bbc article accused the u.s. president of blowing up the world order. but that is sheer eurocentrism, because trump is merely resetting washingtons relationship with europe and europe is not the whole world. in fact, there are good signs that europe is reacting to trump in a healthy way for example, the newly elected german leader has decided that germany must spend huge amounts in upgrading its military, notwithstanding that it necessarily will have to cut welfare spending and retune its growth model. expectedly, when europe is strong and wholesome again, trump will be gone from the stage and his successors will be able to mend fences with all obstacles removed. at that point, the world will still be essentially bipolar the open society camp versus the authoritarian-or-worse camp. there will be two main theaters where the conflict between the two camps will be played out. first is asia, in which the united statesrid of its european baggage and in some kind of alliance with japan, taiwan, south korea, and australiawill face off against the chinese regime. the mightiest power on earth will try to roll back and contain the most dangerous. next is europe, where a reformed and repowered european union will take on russia. a second-rate power will try to keep a third-rate one in check. it will be a much more rational conflict configuration and manageable division of labor for the west than it is now. views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the epoch times or zerohedge. receive a daily recap featuring a curated list of must-read stories.

  Title: In A World Hooked On Hard Power And Greed, Latin America Offers Another Way - Worldcrunch
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-23 16:07:00)
  Content: bogotá we just need to listen to the declarations made by claudia sheinbaum about latin americas cooperation potential at the celac conference. from that speech last week in honduras by mexicos new president, we see anew how the 21st century has brought nothing but bad news for the poor of asia, africa and latin america. as the world gets more dangerous and divided, the newspapers seem to have one basic message for our continent it is irrelevant. for the latest news views from every corner of the world, worldcrunch today is the only truly international newsletter. sign up here. china as an economic power, russia as a military power and the united states as a technological power, are fighting for hegemony over the world. europe, the only region with which we have something in common, if only for our cultural affinities and aspirations, has lost clout and its own historical vocation. not that we are europe, nor do we even know yet what exactly we are only that, historically, latin america has always been a part of the spoils shared among the powers. as the economists say, at the banquet of politics, those not on the guest list are on the menu, and that is what has happened with our continent. but remember, the powerful are often conquered by their conquests. england colonized the united states only to end up in a subordinate position. the united states grabbed mexican territory and has ended up with an enormous hispanic population, with spanish as the countrys second language. europe invaded, well, everywhere, mixing the races and confounding the predominance of those supposedly purer races. it is a challenging moment in history, and latin america needs something more than a mere project for its own consumption. it should instead show that it is capable to become the face of a project that serves not armies or specific corporations or big tech, but humanity. take china, the great miracle of our time. it reinvented itself 75 years ago yanking 800 million people out of poverty and has shown over four decades that an ancient civilization can engage in a daring dialogue with modernity. but china is disciplined, collectivist and despotic and miracles of its caliber need those three conditions. russia is different. it appears to be vaster than the world itself, arousing greed and envy in all and sundry, but remains trapped in the clash of anarchy and despotism. it is a land of conflict, torment, barbaric violence and refinement. only russia, as a land of unique compassion and of extreme cruelty, could have given birth to that autocrat ivan the terrible, those giants of literature dostoevsky and tolstoy, lenin and stalin but also osip mandelstam, the poet who shared their horrific times. the united states was for a long time an example of faith in democracy, as defined by another poet, walt whitman. it came to symbolize humane instincts, institutional strengths and private enterprise, but also the work ethic, naivety and even excess. that very excess has led it to become the worlds most opulent, and most indebted, country, which ultimately means disaster. the counterpart to its internal freedom was external aggression. surprisingly, more than two centuries after the french revolution and its ideals of liberté, égalité and fraternité, the modern world is facing a far harsher paradigm the triple hegemony of the chinese model, which entirely disregards freedom the u.s. model, marked by its contempt for equality and the russian model, which has cast doubt on the very notion of fraternity. when europe sought to embody those principles, the counterpart to its internal freedom was external aggression its model of equality treated the rest of humanity as inferior and its dream of fraternity sank in the blood of endless wars nation against nation, race against race, sect against sect. europes history seems to suggest that equality is the enemy of freedom, and that freedom is the enemy of fraternity. europe gave birth to the philosophy of human rights and christian humanism. yet, as it infected the rest of the world with its christianity, its liberalism, marxism and yearning for material comfort and even supremacy, it was exhausting itself struggling to maintain unity and contain internal rivalries. china, russia and the united states have a far narrower interest, namely their own economic, military and technological supremacy. they appear oblivious to an unfolding reality that their transformative industries, insatiable rearmament, unfathomable technologies and their tug-of-war, may entail our collective downfall. the world needs more than this, something that cannot be given by industry, military power or the technological frenzy. and that is a sense of balance, not supremacy, of friendly cohabitation instead of the domineering urge, and a sense of awe for what we already have instead of follies and hubris. the ideal of living in opulence, with better weapons and control through technology has created a bubble of delusion that could burst at any moment. empires project themselves as endless but are surprisingly fragile. rome may have lasted for centuries, yet the soviet union only lasted decades, and napoleon and hitlers 1000-year reich a mere few years. and the current struggle between the planetary titans could turn everything to ash in moments. who knows if, as jesus declares in the bible, the meek shall inherit the earth, but its already clear the thugs of our world have a fight on their hands if they want it all. the future, should we ever see it, may yet belong to those who have nothing to lose, who wield no arms and are not consumed by hate. the compassionate among us have certainly more to give than any tycoon or philanthropist, while those who know what gratitude means are in turn enriched by this gift of god that makes everything before them a miracle. europes greatness is thus not in its empires but in christs doctrine, chinas and indias in the teachings of lao tseu and the buddha, russias in the lives and novels of dostoevsky and tolstoy, and the united states in the poetry of whitman and emily dickinson. these constitute a hoard of wealth available to the poorest among us. there have been barely any wars between latin american nations and we may be sure it wont be the message of opulence but the efforts of millions of ordinary workers that will restore dignity to our lives. our security wont come from inexhaustible, mechanized armies or giant prisons, but from our efforts to teach and live together. let us recall here, there have been barely any wars between latin american nations, as none aspires to supremacy. nobody will earn a place in history for wielding some crushingly effective technology, but for their ability to honor, protect and respectfully utilize what we still have namely the natural world we live in. in a world sickened with ambition, we might do well to read some of the gentle poetry of our continent like the missionary el misionero by argentinas almafuerte pedro palacios, lucky the normal people felices los normales by roberto fernández retamar or soft fatherland la suave patria by lópez velarde. for therein lie our grace and charm. to those beggars who need people to come and kneel before them, the colombian poet porfirío barba jacob has said in all his splendor, rest your fatigue on mine, and i shall lay my grief on yours. to the greedy who say they must grab a piece of land or a planet, diogenes the cynic said from the depths of the past, repeating the words of his teacher antisthenes, that in this world, the only things of value are those floating to the surface with their owner in a shipwreck. it is always good to listen to a calm and respectful voice, when blind powers want to send us full speed toward the ultimate shipwreck.

  Title: UN researchers warn that Asian scam operations are spreading across the rest of the world
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-21 15:23:50)
  Content: bangkok ap transnational organized crime groups in east and southeast asia are spreading their lucrative scam operations across the globe in response to increased crackdowns by authorities, according to a u.n. report issued on monday. for several years, scam compounds have proliferated in southeast asia, especially in border areas of cambodia, laos and myanmar, as well as in the philippines, shifting operations from site to site to stay a step ahead of the police. more recently, scam centers that have bilked victims out of billions of dollars through false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes are now being reported operating as far afield as africa and latin america. asian crime syndicates have been expanding operations deeper into remote areas with lax law enforcement that are vulnerable to the influx, according to the report issued by the u.n. office on drugs and crime or unodc. the report is titled inflection point global implications of scam centers, underground banking and illicit online marketplaces in southeast asia. this reflects both a natural expansion as the industry grows and seeks new ways and places to do business, but also a hedging against future risks should disruption continue and intensify in southeast asia, benedikt hofmann, unodcs acting regional representative for southeast asia and the pacific, said in a statement. unodc estimates that hundreds of industrial-scale scam centers generate just under 40 billion in annual profits. the trend to hedge beyond the region has been consistent with continued reports of crackdowns targeting asian-led scam centers that have been found operating in africa, south asia, the middle east and select pacific islands, as well as related money laundering, people trafficking and recruitment services discovered in europe, north america and south america. in africa, nigeria has become a hot spot, with police raids in late 2024 and early 2025 leading to many arrests, including people from east and southeast asia suspected of cryptocurrency and romance scams. zambia and angola have also busted asian-linked cyberfraud operations. in latin america, the report says that its notable that brazil has emerged as one country that has faced a growing set of challenges related to cyber-enabled fraud, online gambling, and related money laundering, with some linkages to criminal groups operating in southeast asia. it also notes that in late 2023 in peru, more than 40 malaysians were rescued after being trafficked by a taiwan-based gang known as the red dragon syndicate that forced them to commit cyber-enabled fraud. the report also points to crackdowns on asian-led scam centers in the middle east and some pacific islands. alarmingly, even as asian-led groups have been expanding the geographical scope of their operations, the involvement of criminal groups from other parts of the world is also growing, the report says. new online markets, money laundering networks, stolen data products, malware, artificial intelligence and deepfake technologies are laying the ground for the rise of crime as a service, the report says. these technological innovations facilitate conducting their businesses online and adapt to crackdowns. the convergence between the acceleration and professionalization of these operations on the one hand and their geographical expansion into new parts of the region and beyond on the other translates into a new intensity in the industry one that governments need to be prepared to respond to, hofmann says.

  Title: Spain unveils €11bn plan to reach long-delayed Nato defence spending target
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-22 13:24:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: Spain's increased defense spending, spurred by pressure from NATO and the perceived threat from Russia ('vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security'), aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize their security in an anarchic international system. This action demonstrates a shift towards self-reliance and power balancing within Europe.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Spain's commitment to increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP, but also mentions criticism from coalition partners who describe the plans as 'incoherent and absolutely exorbitant.' This suggests internal political divisions regarding defense priorities and resource allocation. What are the specific concerns of the coalition partners, and how might these internal disagreements affect the implementation and effectiveness of the defense plan?

  Content: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year, saying it has become obvious only europe will know how to protect europe from now on. the country which lags well behind other western nations by dedicating about 1.3 of its gdp to defence spending is one of the nato members that has been pressured by the trump administration to increase its spending, and had previously committed to hitting the 2 threshold by 2029. but speaking on tuesday morning, spains prime minister, pedro sánchez, unveiled a 10.5bn 9bn industrial and technological plan for security and defence that will allow spain to meet the 2 commitment in 2025. sánchez said the plan, which has been approved by his cabinet and will now be submitted to the eu and nato, was needed to address the current and future defence challenges. its main focus will be telecommunications, cybersecurity and buying military equipment. the enemies of europe are not just using missiles as we have seen in ukraine over the past three years, he said. theyre also using unmanned drones and paramilitary forces to sabotage supply chains and to cut gas lines and underwater cables. theyre using social networks to issue disinformation and to polarise people and spread disaffection towards democratic institutions. theyre using ai cyber-attacks and quantum computers to compromise out telecommunications, our supply networks, and our public services in order to target our way of life. the prime minister who pointed out that his administration was finally making good on the 2 commitment pledged by its conservative predecessor in 2014 said the new plan would help reinforce european security in record time. in a world thats dominated by uncertainty, europe is hope and it is certainty and that certainty must be protected by strengthening our security and defence systems because given whats going on, its obvious that only europe will know how to protect europe, he added. and spain will contribute to protecting europe. sánchez said vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security, no matter how far any eu member state was from the frontlines of the conflict in ukraine. the security and stability of ukraine, of eastern europe and the baltic and nordic countries, is also the security and the safety of spain, he said. the people who live in those countries know that putin is serious and that his words are backed by deeds and thats why they look to europe for protection. theyre looking for something important, and that is unity. spain will not be indifferent to that demand. ukraine resists, europe responds and spain fulfils its obligations. sánchez also repeated his assurances that the additional spending would not lead to increased taxes, raids on the welfare state budget, or deficit increases. the plan has faced criticism from coalition partners in the leftwing sumar platform, who described the plans as incoherent and absolutely exorbitant. in january, donald trump increased pressure on nato, claiming the us had shouldered the global defence burden for too long and saying he would ask all nato members to increase defence spending to 5 of gdp. the nato secretary-general, mark rutte, has urged member states to use the threats from washington as an incentive to take unilateral action on raising defence contributions. last month, rutte said the pressure was already paying off in countries such as spain, portugal, belgium and italy. i tell them that, well, now i am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2 by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2 because we have to spend much, much more than 2 but now i am calling you, but you might get a very, erm, patient man from washington on the line if you dont listen to me, he said.

  Title: US committed as ever to Nato and Trump is not against the alliance, says Rubio
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-03 15:25:55)
  Content: washington wants to see european countries increase defence spending to five per cent, the us secretary of state said from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. the us is as committed to nato as ever, secretary of state marco rubio said, hours after the alliances countries were left reeling by donald trumps watershed tariff announcement. mr rubio touched down in brussels earlier on thursday before natos foreign ministers convened to discuss global security and ongoing efforts to reach peace in ukraine. but the 53-year-old met with his counterparts amid the backdrop of rising tensions between washington and its allies within the alliance, elevated after the us presidents bombshell tariff speech on wednesday. the trump administration had already raised significant doubts about natos future, questioning the efficacy of the 75-year-old alliance and how far americas membership was in the us national interest. dismissing doubts about washingtons commitment to nato as hysteria, mr rubio told reporters during a press conference with secretary-general mark rutte the united states is in nato. the united states is as active in nato as it has ever been. the us president is not against nato, mr rubio said, rather he is against a nato that does not have the capabilities that it needs to fulfill the obligations that the treaty imposes upon each and every member state. he then called on european countries to develop a pathway to bring their defence spending to five per cent of gdp, a move which mr trump has previously called for and a vast increase on the current 2 per cent goal. addressing european concerns about the timeframe and extent to which the us was considering reducing reducing its nato engagement, mr rubio said we do want to leave here with an understanding that we are on a pathway, a realistic pathway, to every single one of the members committing and fulfilling a promise to reach up to five per cent of spending. this included the us, he said, adding no one expects that youre going to be able to do this in one year or two. but the pathway has to be real. washington expects european ministers to use this weeks meeting to demonstrate their plans to boost defence spending, with just 23 of natos 32 members meeting the current 2 per cent target last year. but ukraine will also likely be a key topic in the discussions, as europe looks to gain more influence over the talks - which have been heavily led by the us so far. kirill dmitriev, one of vladimir putins most trusted international envoys, is currently in washington for the first official visit of a russian since the full-scale invasion of ukraine in 2022. the us-educated, former goldman sachs investment banker, who was invited by us middle east envoy steve witkoff, has a strong relationship with many us officials including key members of the trump team - but details of the talks have so far been kept under wraps. finlands president alexander stubb said on thursday that at least one country from the so-called coalition of the willing - the group of countries willing to engage in peacekeeping efforts in ukraine - should speak directly with russia. my personal preference would be that our representatives of the coalition of the willing would be doing that. in other words france or the united kingdom, he said. mr stubb proposed france or the uk as the best candidates to do so. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Ukraine-Russia war latest: Putin to send top negotiator to Washington as US anger grows over peace deal talks
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-02 14:58:26)
  Content: putin envoy kirill dmitriev was born in kyiv, educated in the us, and reportedly has good relations with washington officials from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. vladimir putin is set to send his top negotiator to washington in a bid to win back the favour of donald trump, who is reportedly angry at the russian autocrat. washington officials have acknowledged that putin is resisting attempts to strike a ceasefire, and discussed what economic or diplomatic punishments could push russia closer to a deal, the sources said. it comes following mr trumps explosive reveal that he was p off with putin and would look to unleash oil tariffs on russia if they did not take peace talks seriously. kirill dmitriev, putins kyiv-born and us-educated envoy, will meet with mr trumps middle east envoy steve witkoff this week, reuters reported. responding to the reports on x, mr dmitriev said the resistance to usrussia dialogue is realdriven by entrenched interests and old narratives. but what if improved relations are exactly what the world needs for lasting global security and peace? on tuesday, two senior washington sources told reuters that a peace deal does not seem imminent, despite us efforts. meanwhile, half of the us senate - including 25 republicans and 25 democrats - has united to propose sanctions on russia if it refuses to engage in good faith negotiations with ukraine. three people have been killed after a russian missile hit an enterprise in the ukrainian city of kryvyi rih, the regional governor said. at least one person was injured, he added on telegram, while the attack sparked fire. ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said that he had been sharing information with the united states. he posted on x on tuesday we have shared all information regarding russias violations in the energy sector there were strikes, and today again in kherson, a russian drone targeted an energy facility and equipment deliberately and purposefully. part of the city was left without electricity. we insist that every such violation must be documented and receive a response from our partners. it is precisely these small details that add up to russias major delays in the diplomatic process. the unconditional cessation of strikes proposed by the united states is not being implemented solely because of russias position. nato countries allies have pledged more than 20 billion euros 16.73 billion in military support for ukraine in the first three months of the year, secretary-general mark rutte said on wednesday. foreign ministers from the alliance meet in brussels on thursday and friday to discuss further support for ukraine against russias three-year-old invasion. if youre just joining us now, heres everything you need to know so far on wednesday donald trump must not be misled by vladimir putins stalling tactics to delay peace in ukraine, outgoing german minister annalena baerbock said during a visit to kyiv. the us president showed the first signs of frustration with his russian counterpart over the weekend, telling nbc news he was p off and very angry with putin over the failure to reach an agreement with a ceasefire - before threatening to unleash oil tariffs on moscow. paying a final visit to kyiv as germanys foreign minister - before a new government takes office with cdu leader friedrich merz at the helm - ms baerbock said she would raise the issue with us secretary of state marco rubio during a meeting of nato foreign ministers this week. at the upcoming meeting of nato foreign ministers, we will make it clear to the american side that we should not engage with putins stalling tactics, the 44-year-old greens leader said in a statement released after her arrival in the ukrainian capital. read the full report anti-corruption officers in ukraine have exposed a 17.8 million embezzlement scheme in the defence ministry, ukraines national anti-corruption bureau nabu has said. the funds were embezzled during food procurement for the armed forces between 2022 and 2023, and have led to charges being brought against a former head of department within the ministry of defence. food supplies for the army were arranged through pre-assembled food kits taken from a selection of 409 items - but only 10 per cent of those products were regularly ordered, nabu said according to ukrainska pravda. other items such as spices and berries, were very rarely due to their seasonal nature. this system allowed suppliers to manipulate prices artificially inflating the cost of high-demand products while lowering prices for unpopular or seasonal products such as cherries or apricots in winter. at first glance, there were no violations, as the total price of the kit remained unchanged. however, potatoes, supplied in thousands of tonnes, cost a fortune, while seasonal berries and fruits, which were rarely ordered, were priced at mere pennies. ukraine is has come up 10 billion short in what is needed for recovery efforts in 2025, kyivs prime minister denuys shmyhal said on wednesday. kyiv needs 39.3 billion in international support this year and its partners have confirmed their commitment to covering this amount, mr shmyhal said. but so far the overall shortfall is nearly 10 billion, he said after the 13th meeting of the steering committee of the ukraine donor platform. this year, we consider the key areas of joint work of the ukraine donor platform to be budget support, sustainable financing for infrastructure, housing and energy recovery, as well as economic development and investment attraction on the path to the eu, he said. the ukrainian military recorded 176 clashes with russian forces over the past day, 64 of which took place on the eastern pokrovsk front. vladimir putins forces have been steadily advancing near pokrovsk, a strategic ukrainian town which serves as a supply hub for other areas of the frontline. russia has aimed to cut supply lines to and from pokrovsk to other ukrainian-controlled areas. clashes were also recorded on the fronts in kharkiv, kupiansk, lyman, toretsk, kursk and others. the grinding war of attrition in eastern ukraine has seen russia send large masses of troops charging towards stretched ukrainian defences, claiming incremental territorial gains at the cost of large manpower losses. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Power Play: Navigating Energy Demand in America’s Grand Strategy - The National Interest
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 11:34:58)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article reflects Realist principles by emphasizing energy security as a national security priority. The text states, "creating safe, secure and reliable energy supply chains is therefore a national security priority" and discusses how "securing reliable energy sources is rising to the top of most countries national security to-do list." This highlights the state's pursuit of power and security in an anarchic international system, where energy resources are a key component of national strength.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the potential for US energy partnerships to "shape how the united states positions and structures its military in the pacific to be able to safeguard this critical supply chain." This suggests a potential shift in US military strategy driven by economic interests, raising the question: To what extent will economic considerations dictate US military deployments and strategic alliances in the future?

      > Snippet: the international energy agency recently released its assessment of where trends in energy demand are pointing.
    - Artificial Intelligence:
      > Snippet: it is estimated that the electricity demand needed to power the growth in the use of ai doubles every 100 days.
      > Snippet: the massive increase in energy demand that data centers, ai utilization and chip fabrication facilities require cannot come at the expense of the existing demands that a modern, high-energy economy imposes on the grid.
      > Snippet: economies are being transformed by the growing utilization of artificial intelligence ai to drive the massive data centers which are tasked with researching and developing solutions for upgrading and transforming how we connect, how we manufacture goods and services, and how we cope with a host of perennial challenges ranging from disease to the effective utilization of resources.
  Content: as the world enters the fourth industrial revolution, energy demand needs to continue to play a role in americas grand strategy. two important geo-economic and geo-technological trends are converging. as the world transitions to the fourth industrial revolution, economies are being transformed by the growing utilization of artificial intelligence ai to drive the massive data centers which are tasked with researching and developing solutions for upgrading and transforming how we connect, how we manufacture goods and services, and how we cope with a host of perennial challenges ranging from disease to the effective utilization of resources. the massive energy demand required to power such centers and the related industrial hubs that produce the components that these facilities require connect directly to the energy security challenge. the massive increase in energy demand that data centers, ai utilization and chip fabrication facilities require cannot come at the expense of the existing demands that a modern, high-energy economy imposes on the grid. there are specific infrastructure demands for creating and operating these facilities, and their absence means that harnessing these new technologies cannot occur, starting with energy. creating safe, secure and reliable energy supply chains is therefore a national security priority it is estimated that the electricity demand needed to power the growth in the use of ai doubles every 100 days. the international energy agency recently released its assessment of where trends in energy demand are pointing. the iea predicts a global doubling of energy consumption by data centers to 945 terawatt hours by 2030 which, as they note, is slightly more than the entire electricity usage for japan in 2024. greater use of energy-efficient technologies can only dent, not erase, this growth in demand. given reindustrialization commitments and a desire to secure other supply chains, especially in the united states, there is likely to be little appetite for shifting energy usage from other high-energy industrial projects including the production of steel, concrete and a variety of petrochemicals. more generation capacity is needed. europes experience over the past several years first with attempting to use higher conventional energy prices as a way to force the adoption of renewables, and then with the loss of large supplies of cheaper russian gas in the aftermath of the invasion of ukraine has contributed to a de-industrialization trend across the continent. securing energy abundance is now an absolute necessity for europes economic recovery. this lesson has not been lost in other parts of the world, and securing reliable energy sources is rising to the top of most countries national security to-do list. nuclear energy provides one long-term solution, but creating and rapidly scaling up nuclear power faces considerable regulatory and financial hurdles and cannot address the near-term gaps opening up between energy supply and demand. this leaves natural gas as the preferred fuel of choice for powering new generation capacity as well as continuing to incentivize the transformation of coal-burning plants to a cleaner energy source. as morgan bazilian has noted, the energy consultant group enverus predicts up to eighty new gas-powered plants, adding some forty-six gigawatts of capacity, will be built in the united states by 2030. this increased thirst for the blue fuel is powering a new round of russian confidence that after three years of stringent western sanctions on russias natural gas sector, economic realities will begin to win out over an ideological commitment to the continued enlargement of the euro-atlantic community to the post-soviet space. there has been a quiet but emerging call, particularly on the part of some of the continents manufacturing and petrochemical firms for being able to add more russian energy back into the european energy mix. but this growing energy demand not only across the atlantic but also throughout the indo-pacific basin provides the united states with a geo-economic rationale for its traditional geopolitical commitments. creating two massive energy bridges one across the atlantic, one across the pacific, could connect north american energy sources to growing demand from u.s. allies and partners and provide a renewed rationale for the united states to maintain its role in being able to secure and project power across the two oceans. in april, uniper, in germany, committed to purchasing lng from woodsides louisiana project, while total, in france, agreed to accept 1.5 million tons per annum mtpa per year as part of a twenty-year contract from rio grande energys train 4. this builds on the massive expansion of european purchases that have pushed the united states to the rank of the third-largest supplier of gas to europe. in turn, a steady stream of lng tankers crossing the atlantic provides a clear economic rationale for the revitalization of the u.s. second fleet to secure this critical trans-atlantic energy chain, alongside the effort to ensure the unimpeded surge of u.s. forces and equipment to europe in the event of any major conflict. and in the last month, weve seen a revival of interest on the part of japanese, korean and taiwanese firms for developing alaskas gas reserves and the necessary export infrastructure for lng to be sent across the pacific. other u.s. partners, including india and vietnam, have signaled their possible interest. this could create an analog of a pacific energy corridor with a steady, reliable supply of energy and also shape how the united states positions and structures its military in the pacific to be able to safeguard this critical supply chain. and in both cases, u.s. security commitments would be more aligned with its geo-economic interests. if this energy partnership gets off the ground, it could also create a new impetus for cooperation in other areas. japanese and south korean shipyards could be essential partners in helping to scale up the number of hulls for future u.s. navy vessels and to help close the gap with the production coming out of chinese yards. reliable, predictable energy sources would be critical for ensuring stable prices. lng partnerships could also lay the basis for longer-term cooperation in setting up allied consortia for capturing the benefits of nuclear power. china and russia, of course, also have cards to play. russia still has preexisting even, if in some cases, damaged infrastructure that could be restarted at a lower cost than making the necessary longer-term investments for european and asian partners to continue to pivot away from moscow. chinese firms are taking the lead in locking up long-term contracts for lng not only for expected domestic use but also, more critically, to be able to trade on global markets. the window for using increased global demand for energy as a way to lock in u.s. partnerships will not remain open indefinitely. nikolas k. gvosdev directs the national security program at the foreign policy research

  Title: Von der Leyen: World is ‘lining up’ to work with Europe amid Trump’s trade war - politico.eu
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 03:20:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Realism, the article depicts international relations as a struggle for power and influence, particularly in the economic sphere. The text highlights the US using trade tariffs as a tool of national interest ('donald trumps blanket trade tariffs upended global markets') and the EU positioning itself as a counterweight ('touted the eu as a safe haven', 'countries are lining up to work with us'). This aligns with the Realist view that states prioritize their own security and economic power, leading to competition and attempts to shift the balance of power, as suggested by the phrase 'the global order is shifting more deeply'. The interpretation is that the trade disputes are not merely economic disagreements but manifestations of underlying geopolitical power dynamics between major blocs.; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is evident in how leaders attempt to frame the narrative. Ursula von der Leyen actively promotes the EU as 'a safe haven' and emphasizes its 'steadfastness' and 'stability' ('europe stands firm, grounded in values'). This framing aims to set the public and international agenda on the EU's reliability amidst 'unpredictable' global events caused by others (implicitly, the US). The theory suggests that by emphasizing certain aspects (EU stability) and downplaying others (internal EU challenges, 'europes place in the world is ever more uncertain'), leaders can influence public perception and prioritize issues on the political agenda. This interpretation suggests the article captures a deliberate effort by the EU leadership to control the narrative about its global standing.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents a strong narrative of EU stability and attractiveness, citing the Eurobarometer survey and countries 'lining up' to work with the EU. However, it later includes a direct quote stating, 'europes place in the world is ever more uncertain. the battle for relevance will dominate the next 10 years.' This juxtaposition is intriguing because it introduces a significant counter-narrative of uncertainty and struggle immediately after promoting stability. What might explain this apparent contradiction in framing within the same article? Could this shift reflect different sources or perspectives being integrated, or perhaps an attempt to acknowledge challenges while still emphasizing resilience?

      > Snippet: global merchandise trade could shrink by 1.5 percent this year, with north america hardest hit, the world trade organization forecasts.
  Content: in exclusive comments to politico, the european commission president touted the eu as a safe haven in an unpredictable world. ai generated text-to-speech brussels countries are ready to work with reliable trade partners in europe after united states president donald trumps blanket trade tariffs upended global markets, european commission president ursula von der leyen told politico. in a more and more unpredictable global environment, countries are lining up to work with us, the commission president said without naming trump or the u.s. in recent weeks she has spoken to leaders from iceland, new zealand, malaysia, the philippines, canada, india and the united arab emirates who were looking for strong, reliable partners. the global order is shifting more deeply than at any time since the cold war ended, von der leyen added. trump announced the reciprocal tariffs on april 2 hitting the eu with a 20 percent levy and most of the rest of the world with a baseline tariff of 10 percent. as financial markets melted down a week later, trump suspended the higher tariffs for 90 days to open the way for talks on a trade deal. in the eus case, it is still paying that 10 percent rate, as well as 25 percent on exports of steel, aluminum and cars while the u.s. and china have hit each other with triple-digit tariffs. if trump reimposes those reciprocal tariffs, global merchandise trade could shrink by 1.5 percent this year, with north america hardest hit, the world trade organization forecasts. von der leyen has contrasted this volatility by playing up europes steadfastness. amid such upheaval, confidence in the eu was on the rise, she argued, including from the blocs own citizens, referring to a eurobarometer survey showing support for membership in the bloc at 74 percent, its highest level in 40 years. that says something. in the middle of the chaos, europe stands firm, grounded in values, ready to shape what comes next, von der leyen said. still, its unclear if the u.s. or the eus approach is winning. as europe looks to strike new trade deals, including a long-delayed pact with the mercosur trading bloc of south american countries, trump is holding talks with the leaders of several foreign nations including italian prime minister giorgia meloni. the conservative leader, one of the few european politicians to have trumps favor, was welcomed with open arms this week at the white house, where the u.s. president said there would 100 percent be a trade deal with the eu. but no concrete details of a potential deal have yet emerged from the meeting, and eu officials are skeptical about the chances of a quick fix. meanwhile, senior eu officials whom trump has systematically shunned in favor of national leaders are ramping up their diplomatic outreach, with von der leyen reportedly planning a trip to china to meet president xi jinping later this year. the european commission will enforce its digital rulebook without fear, said commission president ursula von der leyen. a decade after we launched in brussels, europes place in the world is ever more uncertain. the battle for relevance will dominate the next 10 years. the bloc designated kosovo, colombia, morocco, tunisia, egypt, bangladesh and india as safe. a worsening showdown across the atlantic could spell trouble for the candidate country.

  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism is relevant here. Germany's veto of the Eurofighter sale to Turkey, after the jailing of Istanbul's mayor, and Turkey's subsequent assertion that its national interests supersede individual politicians ('turkeys national interests are more valuable than erdoğan or imamoğlu') exemplifies the realist emphasis on national interest and power politics in international relations. This suggests that despite potential ideological differences or human rights concerns, states prioritize their strategic and economic goals.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents a series of seemingly disparate events, linked only by their occurrence on specific dates.

  Title: Britain and France accuse Russia's Putin of delaying Ukraine ceasefire efforts
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-04 08:43:41)
  Content: from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. britain and france on friday accused russian president vladimir putin of dragging his feet in ceasefire talks aimed at halting his countrys invasion of ukraine and demanded a swift response from moscow after weeks of u.s. efforts to secure a truce. russia has effectively rejected a u.s. proposal for a full and immediate 30-day halt in the fighting. a kremlin official said monday that moscow views efforts to end its more than three-year war with ukraine as a drawn-out process. our judgment is that putin continues to obfuscate, continues to drag his feet, british foreign secretary david lammy told reporters at nato headquarters, standing alongside his french counterpart jean-noel barrot in a symbolic show of unity. a kremlin envoy who visited washington this week for talks with trump administration officials said friday that further meetings will be needed to resolve outstanding issues. kirill dmitriev told russian reporters that the dialogue will take some time, but its proceeding positively and constructively. he criticized what he called a well-coordinated media campaign and attempts by various politicians to spoil russia-u.s. relations, distort what russia says, and cast russia and its leaders in a negative way. dmitriev, the head of russias sovereign wealth fund, was sanctioned by the biden administration after the invasion of ukraine, and the u.s. had to temporarily lift the restrictions to allow him to travel to washington this week. meanwhile, the war of attrition continued to claim civilian lives. a russian shahed drone struck a residential area of kharkiv late thursday, killing five people and injuring 32, according to mayor ihor terekhov. kharkiv is ukraines second-largest city. civilian areas in three other ukrainian regions were also hit, officials said. the ukrainian air force said russia fired 78 strike and decoy drones overnight. russias defense ministry said air defenses destroyed 107 ukrainian drones. russian forces are preparing to launch a fresh military offensive in the coming weeks to maximize pressure on ukraine and strengthen the kremlins negotiating position in the ceasefire talks, according to ukrainian government and western military analysts. russia is preparing a major, multi-pronged ground offensive along the 1,000-kilometer 620-mile front line as muddy fields dry out and allow tanks, armored vehicles and other heavy equipment to roll into key positions across the countryside. britain and france are helping to lead a multinational effort known as the coalition of the willing to set up a force that might police any future peace agreement in ukraine. a senior ukrainian official said earlier this week that between 10 and 12 countries have said they are ready to join the coalition. lammy said that while putin should be accepting a ceasefire, he continues to bombard ukraine. its civilian population. its energy supplies. we see you, vladimir putin. we know what you are doing. barrot said that ukraine had accepted ceasefire terms three weeks ago, and that russia now owes an answer to the united states. u.s. president donald trump has expressed frustration with putin and ukraines president volodymyr zelenskyy after he promised last year to bring the war to a swift conclusion. russia has been flip-flopping, continuing its strikes on energy infrastructure, continuing its war crimes, barrot said. it has to be yes. it has to be no. it has to be a quick answer. he said that russia shows no intention of halting its military campaign, noting that putin on monday ordered a call-up intended to draft 160,000 conscripts for a one-year tour of compulsory military service. the two foreign ministers pledged to continue helping to build up ukraines armed forces the countrys best security guarantee since the u.s. took any prospect of nato membership off the table. coalition army chiefs were due to meet in kyiv on friday. defense ministers from the group will meet at nato headquarters next thursday. novikov reported from kyiv, ukraine. follow aps coverage of the war in ukraine at httpsapnews.comhubrussia-ukraine

  Title: Greece to invest €25 billion in defence, eyes Israel for ‘Shield of Achilles’ dome
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-03 04:09:03)
  Content: the mediterranean country already fulfils nato obligation to spend 2 of gdp on defence, investing nearly 3.5 so far. news based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. getty imagesnurphoto contributor based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. print email reddit facebook linkedin whatsapp telegram greece will invest 25 billion in strengthening its defence over the next 12 years, greek prime minister kyriakos mitsotakis said on tuesday, adding that israel will be a key partner. the mediterranean country already fulfils nato obligation to spend 2 of gdp on defence, investing nearly 3.5 so far. in his speech in parliament, the centre-right leader stressed the need for drones and noted that europe is currently facing a production gap in defence, especially in defence capabilities. mitsotakis announced the creation of shield of achilles, an anti-missile, anti-ballistic umbrella similar to israels iron dome. the shield of achilles will operate on five levels anti-drone, anti-missile, anti-aircraft, anti-ship and anti-submarine. he said that greece already has surface-to-air missile sam patriot, which is produced by the american raytheon and lockheed martin. but to get new ones, it will take four to five years, as there is no production capacity, he said. israel can provide us more quickly, mitsotakis added. earlier this week, mitsotakis had a meeting with his israeli counterpart benjamin netanyahu in tel aviv. the two leaders reportedly discussed the great sea interconnector, an undersea power cable aiming to connect greece, cyprus and israel. the planned cable has received a major eu grant as its considered a european project of common interest. however, the project has been temporarily frozen mainly to the objections raised by neighbouring turkey. the commission is aware of the situation we are in exchange with the greek and cypriot governments on possible future actions, an eu spokesperson told euractiv. athens and tel aviv have lately come closer considering their troubled relations with turkey. greece and turkey have been enjoying some calm lately thanks to an ongoing high-level diplomatic dialogue focusing on the so-called soft politics, as major issues related to maritime disputes will be discussed at a later stage. however, the ships ievoli relume and ng worker which were carrying out research activities about the power cable were forced to stop in march, when turkish naval ships showed up. the greek government seems not willing to shake the calm waters with turkey, as they are still weighing the new balances after donald trumps return as well as ankaras role in europes new push for defence spending. ankara understands well it is needed for europes future security plans. turkish-israeli relations are not easy either. turkish president recep tayyip erdoğan lashed out at israel on sunday during a speech after the end of ramadan prayers. we experienced a wonderful ramadan. may god grant us the right to experience more ramadans. may he not separate us. of course, we know and see what is happening in israel. may god destroy, destroy zionist israel, erdoğan said. israeli foreign minister gideon saar replied immediately dictator erdoğan has revealed his anti-semitic face. he is dangerous for the region, but also for his own people, as has been proven in recent days. lets hope that nato members will understand this as soon as possible. mitsotakis defence announcement comes amid turmoil in his new democracy party due to polls suggesting a free fall. critics in athens suggest that by focusing on defence mitsotakis wants to attract conservative votes as right-wing populists on the right increasingly fish votes from his party. all recent polls show that new democracy is not in a position to form a single-party government anymore, while mitsotakis personal popularity has reached an all-time low. meanwhile, mitsotakis is facing internal opposition. defence minister dendias widely seen in athens as mitsotakis successor - recently organised an event gathering heavyweight new democracy politicians who have openly criticised the prime ministers liberal approach toward turkey. among them was former prime ministers antonis samaras and kostas karamanlis. print email reddit facebook linkedin whatsapp telegram le pen appeal what happens next?

  Title: A frosty welcome awaits Rubio in Europe
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-03 04:09:29)
  Content: some nato diplomats privately question whether their placating strategy towards trump will be enough to fully avert an acrimonious june summit. analysis based on factual reporting, although it incorporates the expertise of the authorproducer and may offer interpretations and conclusions. us secretary of state marco rubio arrives to meet with german foreign minister annalena baerbock at the 61st munich security conference on february 15, 2025 in munich, germany. sean gallupgetty images based on factual reporting, although it incorporates the expertise of the authorproducer and may offer interpretations and conclusions. print email reddit facebook linkedin whatsapp telegram brussels nato foreign ministers are set to meet in brussels on thursday to lay the groundwork for saving the alliances hague summit in june from americas unfolding disaster. rubios in-person encounter with european allies comes only hours after the us slapped sweeping tariffs on europe, kicking off a trade war, and merely a week after the signal chat scandal, where text message exchanges on us strikes on yemen laid bare the trump administrations deep disdain of what they call european freeloading. americas european allies still remember us defense secretary pete hegseth throwing a february meeting into disarray by first announcing a us security shift and removing red lines on ukraine. rubio is expected to be a tiny bit more gentle than that when he touches down in brussels but will be pressed to explain washingtons current course as his counterparts plan to use the talks to lay the groundwork for natos hague summit in june. nato diplomats still see rubio as one of the few remaining republican trans-atlanticists who have been more pragmatic about the value of the western military alliance and security cooperation with europe. but they will be forced to walk a fine line between rebuke and appeasement. a worst-case scenario cited in brussels is us president donald trump attempting to use natos hague summit as a means to force allies into concessions on ukraine, such as a partial lifting of sanctions as part of a us-russia peace deal or anything else, really. there is unspoken agreement that the most effective pressure point trump could use is a drawdown of the around 100,000 american troops stationed in europe. the best guesses by european allies circulating around nato hq involve the roughly 20,000 troops sent by the biden administration to the continent after russia launched its full-scale invasion. european nato allies have already ramped up their efforts, pushed by nato secretary-general mark rutte, who wants every single one of them to commit at least 3.5 gdp as soon as possible. a number of european nato allies, including germany, the uk and others, have made a number of very significant announcements on defence spending over the past weeks. very few are likely to meet trumps call to raise defence expenditure to 5 of gdp, which not even washington currently meets. even with looser eu spending rules, several countriesincluding france, spain, and italywill struggle to satisfy trumps demands quickly. some nato diplomats privately question whether the placating strategy will be enough to fully avert an acrimonious alliance summit with trump in late june. one could read the signal messages in a way that it should have become pretty clear now that this is not only about spending anymore, one european diplomat said, indicating that rubio might face questions to explain comments made. trumps desire to annex greenland is expected to come up when rubio meets bilaterally with danish counterpart lars løkke rasmussen. rubio also will come face-to-face with the eus top diplomat, kaja kallas, whom he snubbed last month during a visit to washington, citing scheduling issues. at present, they are not expected to meet bilaterally in brussels either, an eu official said. rubio will also face questions from allies and ukraines foreign minister andriy sybiha on trumps recent u-turns on kyivs future nato membership, which the alliance last year said was an irreversible path, and a watered-down g7 declaration on russias war in ukraine. nato boss rutte, meanwhile, has been facing an increasingly uncomfortable balancing act, too. by trying to play the honest broker between trump and european allies, he has earned criticism among some nato members for being too soft on washington. yes, europe needs to know that uncle sam still has our back, but america also needs to know that its nato allies will step up and play their full part, without restrictions and without capability gaps, rutte said in warsaw last week. reassurance is a two-way street, he added. print email reddit facebook linkedin whatsapp telegram le pen appeal what happens next?

  Title: Seoul comes looking for Europe’s rearmament cash
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-23 18:00:30)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article highlights the intense competition among nations for economic and military power. The quote, 'seouls defence ambitions are massive to become the worlds fourth-largest arms exporter by 2027,' exemplifies a state's pursuit of power through military and economic means. This aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize their own security and interests in an anarchic international system. The EU's debate over funding foreign companies also reflects Realist concerns about relative gains and the distribution of power.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions 'the europeans sudden need for military gear when the war in ukraine erupted in the winter of 2022 gave the country a massive boost in exports.' This suggests that the war in Ukraine has significantly altered the geopolitical landscape and created new opportunities for arms exporters like South Korea. What are the long-term implications of this shift in the global arms market? How might this increased demand for military gear affect regional stability and international relations?

  Content: athens has been alarmed over possible closer defence ties beween the eu and turkey, a longstanding rival. news based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. joan vallsurbanandsportnurphoto via getty images based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. print email reddit facebook linkedin whatsapp telegram athens greek defence minister nikos dendias expressed his concerns about turkeys participation in europes new defence push at a meeting with his french counterpart, sébastien lecornu. the meeting on monday took place amid growing concerns in athens that neighbouring turkey will take part in the eus new rearm europe plan, which aims to boost investments in defence. commission sources told euractiv last week that under the safe regulation, turkey could immediately provide up to 35 of a defence product to the eu funded through the programme, although a security and defence partnership and subsequent association agreement would be needed to increase industrial participation beyond 35. for his part, lecornu said at a press conference on monday that europe must take its fate into its own hands, always respecting the particularities of each member state. he added that the security interests of all eu member states must be fully respected and there should be clear eligibility criteria for the participation of third countries. greece is not threatening, but is being threatened, dendias said at the same press conference. among other points of conflict between greece and turkey, ankara has threatened athens with possible military action if athens tries to extend its territorial waters to the full extent allowed under the uns convention on the law of the sea. greece and france have been traditional allies. in 2021, they signed a bilateral military agreement that provides mutual assistance in the event of one party coming under attack by a third country, even if the latter belongs to nato. that deal was widely seen as aimed at turkey. dendias expressed his hope for the renewal of the military agreement. greece is always confident that france will take into account in its decisions greeces security and the need for greece to maintain a comparative technological advantage of deterrence against the forces of revisionism, the greek politician said, referring to turkey. diplomats say that turkish weapons systems have been proven in battle for years, and turkish-produced products are often also cheaper. in brussels, a commission official deferred on questions about turkish involved in defence deals as regards to members states, the commission cannot comment on what they decide to do or not on third countries participation. on monday, dendias and lecornu also discussed the establishment of a local office of the french naval group in greece, as well as the possible cooperation between greece and france in the mamba anti-aircraft systems which are in the research and development stage, those conversations come against the backdrop of greeces ambitions to spend billions on a shield of achilles missile defence system modelled on israels famed iron dome, a project recently announced by dendias. the mediterranean country already fulfils nato obligation to spend 2 of gdp on defence, investing nearly 3.5 so far. print email reddit facebook linkedin whatsapp telegram state aid set to energize frances shift away from coal-fired power greece lobbies france for help in limiting turkish access to eu defence deals russia anticipates future where pipeline gas exports to europe never recover burner phones only for eu staff on us trips, commission says live news from the capitals meta faces trial in dc, irish dpc vs. grok, germany vs. france on tech tariffs bridge demolition on berlins a100 highway tests germanys engineering skill exclusive eu pharma ceos urge von der leyen to prevent industry exodus europes electric car revolution needs chargers meps fear pro-industry drift of eu tobacco laws
