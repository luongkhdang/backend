  Title: 100 DAYS OF PUNISHING FOES...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article demonstrates how Trump actively shapes the public's perception by prioritizing certain narratives (e.g., 'political weaponization,' 'lies and abuses') and repeatedly emphasizing them. The text states Trump 'repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate' and 'denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him.' This constant reinforcement influences which issues voters deem important, potentially overshadowing other concerns.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the speed and scope of Trump's actions, noting that 'even the smallest slights drawing reprisals.' This suggests a potential underlying mechanism of personal vendettas driving policy decisions, raising questions about the stability and predictability of the administration's actions. What are the long-term consequences of such personalized governance?; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work.' This raises questions about the ethical implications of such arrangements and whether they constitute a form of extortion or coercion. Does this set a dangerous precedent for future interactions between the government and private entities?

  Content: reuters -hours after swearing an oath to defend the u.s. constitution on january 20, president donald trump signed an executive order directing his attorney general to scour the justice department and other agencies for evidence of political weaponization. the same day, pentagon staff took down a portrait of mark milley, a trump critic who as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been the highest-ranking military officer during trumps first term. that evening, trump stripped his former national security adviser, john bolton - who wrote a memoir critical of trump - of the protective secret service detail he had been given after the justice department said iran had threatened boltons life. in his first 100 days, trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies. these include former intelligence officials who investigated alleged russian ties to his 2016 election campaign and major law firms as well as former biden administration members and prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against him while he was out of power. trumps actions served notice that his campaign promise of political retribution was anything but rhetorical, after he repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate. but the speed and sweep of his actions have caught many by surprise, with even the smallest slights drawing reprisals. the republican president has used the machinery of the state and the power of the presidency to go after people and institutions that have aggrieved him in more expansive ways than any of his predecessors, historians said. its not unusual for presidents to have enemies, said jeremi suri, a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin. what is unusual is for the president to use the entirety of the federal government, not simply to exclude someone, but to directly punish them. trump has made particular use of executive orders - typically used by presidents to direct policy priorities - to target perceived foes by stripping them of security clearances, blocking them from government buildings or directing agencies to probe them for wrongdoing. he has launched multiple federal probes into maine after a verbal spat with the states governor, reached deep into the traditionally independent justice department to fire those he views as disloyal, pulled protective security details from his critics and ordered investigations into former officials who challenged his false claims that his 2020 election loss was rigged. on his first day in office, he removed clearances for 50 former national security officials who had signed a letter suggesting russia was behind a story about salacious material found on a laptop belonging to president joe bidens son hunter. no evidence of russian involvement has emerged. he has also taken away clearances for all three democrats who ran against him in presidential contests biden, hillary clinton and kamala harris. trump has focused much of his attention on the criminal justice system after claiming during his 2024 presidential campaign that his four indictments were motivated by politics. then-president joe bidens administration denied the accusations. in trumps first 100 days, his justice department has fired or demoted dozens of officials, prosecutors and fbi agents, including rank-and-file employees who worked on investigations into trump and the january 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob of trump supporters. in a speech at the justice departments headquarters in february, trump denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him with illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. traditional presidencies have failed to bring meaningful change to the ways of washington, and the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy, a white house spokesman, harrison fields, said in response to questions about trumps retribution efforts and whether they represent an abuse of power. utilizing every tool afforded by the constitution, the trump administration is prioritizing efficiency eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and fulfilling every campaign promise. the ferocity and the scope during his first term, trumps instincts for revenge were sometimes thwarted by his own appointees, many of whom were experienced government hands or establishment republicans. by contrast, trump has filled his second-term administration with steadfast loyalists more likely to back his directives than caution against them. meanwhile, the republican majority in congress has shown little interest in opposing his actions. trump has taken steps as well to eliminate internal watchdogs who might seek to constrain him, purging inspectors general and firing government ethics officials. all administrations, particularly when you see a switch from one party to another, seek to control the executive branch, said historian timothy naftali, the former director of the richard nixon presidential library and museum. its the ferocity and the scope of what hes done that makes it unprecedented. the republican nixon famously had a list of enemies, but he plotted against them in secret. his most aggressive ideas, such as using the tax-collecting internal revenue service to audit his foes, were often blocked by his own officials. other presidents have used their power to penalize rivals in more muted ways, suri said. democrat lyndon johnson sought to discredit his political rival, robert kennedy, in the news media, and republican george w. bush banned brent scowcroft, a former national security adviser, from the white house after scowcroft wrote a column opposing the iraq war. thats often how presidents use their power to go after enemies they keep them out of their administration and spread rumors about them, suri said. trump has frequently intertwined his personal animus against political opponents with his administrations ideological and policy objectives. in february, trump digressed from remarks during a white house meeting with governors to address maine governor janet mills, warning her to comply with an order banning transgender athletes. see you in court, mills, a democrat, replied defiantly. within a day, three separate federal departments had initiated inquiries into whether the state was violating civil rights law, imperiling millions of dollars in federal funding. the justice department sent mills a letter telling her maine was on notice while trump demanded a full-throated apology before the case can be settled. in early april, trumps agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, wrote mills to confirm that some school funding had been frozen. this is only the beginning, rollins warned her. nine days later, the education department said it was taking steps to cut off all federal school funding to the state, and last week attorney general pam bondi announced the justice department had sued maine in federal court. in recent weeks, trump has attacked law firms that once employed attorneys he views as enemies, arguing they undermined the judicial process by doing so. in february, he suspended security clearances for attorneys at the law firm covington burling who had represented smith, the former special counsel investigating him, and sought to cancel any government work the firm had. making little effort to hide his primary motivation, trump suggested sending the pen he used to sign the order to smith as a souvenir. trump has signed executive orders targeting five other law firms, in each case indicating that revenge was an essential factor. his order punishing wilmerhale, for instance, noted that it once employed robert mueller, who investigated whether trumps 2016 campaign had improper connections with russia. nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work on mutually agreed projects backed by the administration. in some cases, trump simply appears determined to get even with former members of his 2017-2021 administration who irked him. this month, the president ordered the justice department to investigate christopher krebs, his former cybersecurity chief who disputed trumps false claims about election fraud in 2020, and miles taylor, a former homeland security official who anonymously wrote a 2019 book critical of trump. signing the executive order targeting the two former officials, trump called taylor a traitor. i think hes guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth, but well find out, he said. dissent isnt unlawful, taylor responded on x. it certainly isnt treasonous. reporting by

Current Article 2 (ID: 130366):
  Title: Challenge to ACA preventive-care panel draws skepticism from Supreme Court
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-21 19:59:15)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: This case can be interpreted through the lens of Separation of Powers doctrine. The article highlights the central question of whether the Preventive Services Task Force's members are 'principal officers' requiring presidential appointment and Senate approval, or 'inferior officers' who can be appointed by department heads. The text states, 'the constitutions appointment clause requires the president to appoint and get senate approval for principal officers...but allows congress to vest authority in department heads and other officials to appoint inferior officers.' This directly reflects the core concern of the Separation of Powers: preventing any one branch from accumulating excessive power. The debate over the task force's independence ('their coverage mandates are neither directed nor supervised by the secretary of health and human services') suggests a potential blurring of lines between the executive and legislative branches, as the task force's recommendations have significant policy implications. This raises concerns about accountability and the potential for unchecked power within the administrative state.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions the plaintiffs' objection to 'being forced to offer pre-exposure medications intended to prevent the spread of hiv among at-risk populations' because they believe 'the medications encourage and facilitate homosexual behavior.' This framing of HIV prevention as enabling 'homosexual behavior' is a noteworthy textual clue. Why does the article include this specific detail about the plaintiffs' beliefs? Could this inclusion be intended to subtly influence the reader's perception of the plaintiffs' motives, potentially framing them as discriminatory or biased, thereby undermining their legal arguments? What are the broader implications of allowing religious beliefs to dictate healthcare coverage decisions, particularly concerning public health initiatives?; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article focuses on the legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act, specifically the preventive care mandate. The fact that the Supreme Court is hearing this case, and the details of the arguments presented ('the justices sharply questioned an attorney for the challengers,' 'that argument seemed to resonate with some justices'), indicate that the issue is gaining prominence in the public discourse. The article also mentions previous unsuccessful attempts to overturn the ACA ('conservatives have tried unsuccessfully to overturn the law several times in recent years'). This repeated litigation, as reported in the media, keeps the ACA and its provisions on the public agenda, potentially influencing public opinion and future policy decisions. The framing of the issue – whether it's about religious freedom, executive power, or healthcare access – can further shape how the public perceives the ACA and its impact.; Intriguing_angles: The article states that 'the appeals court did not invalidate the task forces mandates universally but only as they applied to the plaintiffs.' This limited ruling is intriguing. Why did the appeals court choose to restrict the scope of its decision in this way? Could this suggest a strategic compromise, perhaps reflecting differing views among the judges or a desire to avoid a broader disruption of the healthcare system? What are the potential implications of this limited ruling for other individuals or organizations who may share similar objections to the preventive care mandates?

    - Christian-owned business:
      > Snippet: a lawsuit brought by a christian-owned business and individuals argued that the mandates were unenforceable
  Content: the supreme court appeared skeptical monday of a challenge to a section of the affordable care act that requires health plans to provide no-cost preventive care such as cancer screenings, immunizations and contraception to millions of americans. a lawsuit brought by a christian-owned business and individuals argued that the mandates were unenforceable because members of the expert committee that decides what measures health plans must cover were improperly appointed. health-care providers and nonprofit organizations say the closely watched case could affect critical health services for many americans who might otherwise not have access to them. during oral argument monday, the justices sharply questioned an attorney for the challengers, who said the preventive services task force was unconstitutional because its members should have been appointed by the president and approved by the senate. the plaintiffs sued over the preventive-care provision because they objected to being forced to offer pre-exposure medications intended to prevent the spread of hiv among at-risk populations. the plaintiffs contend that the medications encourage and facilitate homosexual behavior, which they say conflicts with their religious beliefs. the constitutions appointment clause requires the president to appoint and get senate approval for principal officers such as cabinet secretaries, federal judges and ambassadors, but allows congress to vest authority in department heads and other officials to appoint inferior officers. since 2023, the health and human services secretary has made appointments to the 16-member preventive services task force. jonathan mitchell, an attorney for the challengers, argued that task force members were principal officers, drawing skepticism from justice brett m. kavanaugh and some of his colleagues. your theory, i think, depends on us treating the task force as this massively important agency that operates with unreviewable authority, kavanaugh said. normally, before that kind of thing would happen, congress would have provided stronger indications. hashim mooppan, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices that task force members are inferior officers since they can be fired at will by the secretary of the department of health and human services, who also has supervisory authority of the panel and decides when its recommendations take effect. they are subject to ample supervision by the secretary, mooppan said. mitchell keyed in on another section of the law that states that the task forces recommendations must be independent, to the extent practicable and free from political pressure, maintaining that this language indicates that task force members operate with the type of independence that requires senate confirmation. they cannot be inferior officers because their coverage mandates are neither directed nor supervised by the secretary of health and human services or by anyone else who has been appointed as a principal officer, mitchell said. that argument seemed to resonate with some justices. justice samuel a. alito jr., for example, questioned how much authority the hhs secretary really has over the task force. if the task force rates something a or b, then thats it, alito said. even if the members are removable at will, the only way you can get around that is through some really jerry-built arguments. a texas district court originally sided with the challengers, ruling that the task force was unconstitutional and that all mandates it had imposed since 201o were invalid. the government appealed, and the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit affirmed the district courts ruling with one major caveat. the appeals court did not invalidate the task forces mandates universally but only as they applied to the plaintiffs. both the plaintiffs and the government then asked the supreme court to take up the case, with the government saying the lower-court decisions could allow other plaintiffs to seek a nationwide ruling that would invalidate the preventive-care provision. nicholas bagley, an expert in administrative and health law at the university of michigan law school, said there appeared to be a small chance the justices might kick the case back to the 5th circuit to clear up one question whether congress had properly vested the hhs secretary with the ability to appoint task force members. there were at least some justices interested in remanding, bagley said. but it seems likely the government will emerge with a partial victory, if not more than that. the case is just the latest to put the affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare, in the legal crosshairs. conservatives have tried unsuccessfully to overturn the law several times in recent years. in a landmark ruling in 2012, the supreme court upheld its legality.

  Title: Fake Alpine Quest Mapping App Spotted Spying on Russian Military

  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Realism, the article highlights the ongoing competition between states (or state-affiliated actors) in the cyber domain. The targeting of Russian military personnel through a compromised app, as evidenced by "fake alpine quest app laced with spyware was used to target russian military android devices, stealing location data, contacts, and sensitive files," demonstrates a pursuit of strategic advantage through intelligence gathering. This suggests a constant state of low-intensity conflict where information is a valuable resource.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that "at the time of writing, the group behind the campaign has not been identified, and it remains unclear whether this operation is domestic or foreign in origin." This lack of immediate attribution, despite similarities to past Ukrainian hacktivist activities, raises questions about the complexity of cyber warfare.

  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism is relevant here. The article illustrates how a shift in the U.S. administration's policies and rhetoric, specifically "steep trade tariffs" and "suggestions that canada should become a u.s. state," directly impacts Canada's economic and social well-being. This aligns with Realism's emphasis on states acting in their self-interest and the pursuit of power, leading to a competitive and sometimes conflictual international environment. The resulting "chill that has blanketed relations" and the economic consequences for both countries demonstrate the core tenets of Realist thought.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that some Canadians are "quietly preparing to let go of their second homes" but "holding back to see how things play out." This suggests a level of uncertainty and a potential for further shifts in behavior depending on future political developments.

making up 13 of all foreign transactions - more than any other nationality, according to data from the national association of realtors. nearly half of the homes purchased by canadians were for vacation purposes, with florida, arizona and hawaii ranking as the top markets. last week, tracy and dale mcmullen sold their vacation home in buckeye, arizona, a property they owned for five years. the alberta residents, who usually spend four to five months in arizona a year, said they are not planning to come back. we decided to sell the property after the current potus took office, said dale, referring to u.s. president donald trump, who was inaugurated for the second time in january. it was time to leave. we felt we could not trust what he might do next to us as individuals and to our country. we no longer felt welcome nor safe. canadians are feeling stung by the actions and words of the trump administration, which has imposed steep trade tariffs on its northern neighbor, threatening canadas export-dependent economy. trumps repeated suggestions that canada should become a u.s. state, and his derogatory references to now-former prime minister justin trudeau as governor have annoyed canadians and offended their national pride. as a result, many canadians are boycotting u.s.-made goods, such as bourbon and produce and canceling trips to u.s. destinations. canadian return flights from the u.s. fell 13.5 in march from a year earlier, according to statistics canada. canadian-resident return trips by automobile fell about 32. real estate is now facing a similar pullback in demand. laurie lavine, a realtor in arizona who helped the mcmullens with their sale, told reuters that he currently has 18 listings from canadians looking to sell, compared with the usual two to four per quarter. trade friction and the current weakness of the canadian dollar are also contributing to the pullback, lavine said. canadians are also feeling picked on, with u.s. border agents enforcing stricter rules on entering the country, he added. beginning this month, the trump administration is requiring all foreigners 14 or older to register and submit fingerprints if they stay beyond 30 days. canadians, who previously could visit for up to six months without a visa, are subject to the new requirement. the sour feelings that many canadians suddenly feel toward the u.s. are having a big impact on the property market in florida, one of the closest warm-weather states to ontario and quebec, canadas most populous provinces. south floridas residential market has for decades been reliant on the annual influx of canadian snowbirds who either own property and pay property tax or rent for the winter months - either way, a boost to the economy, said ermengarde jabir, a director of economic research at moodys analytics. the first quarter is typically the peak buying season for condominiums in the region, coinciding with when many snowbirds are in town, said andrea hartmann, managing partner of the sandy hartmann group, a real estate firm in the tampa bay area. since the beginning of the year we have not received an offer from a canadian buyer even once, and normally we would, she said. floridas housing market is already reeling. prospective buyers have faced rising insurance premiums, concerns over climate change and a series of devastating hurricanes in recent years. in the tampa-st. petersburg-clearwater region, mortgage lock volume for second homes - or the number of buyers securing rates ahead of purchases - fell 25 on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2025, according to optimal blue, a mortgage technology and data company. now with the political issue, the cost of maintaining a place here in florida and the insurance, a lot of them decided to sell and go, said ken obrian, owner of southwest coast realty in naples, which has specialized in helping canadians purchase properties in florida for about 20 years. there is no incentive to come to the states anymore, said donny b., a native of ontario who is looking to sell his two investment properties in florida. like many snowbirds interviewed for this story, he declined to give his surname, saying he feared backlash. he said he decided to sell because of the political uncertainty, the exchange rate and concern about whether floridians would still welcome canadians in the current climate. i got down here on wednesday and i was nervous. im like, are people going to be pissed off at me? other states have started to see an exodus as well. agents in los angeles and palm springs, california, are working with canadian sellers who are quietly preparing to let go of their second homes, said fatima malik, global real estate advisor at engel volkers beverly hills. some are holding back to see how things play out, but others are already shifting their sights toward places like portugal, mexico, and parts of france, she added. reporting by doyinsola oladipo in new york and mrinalika roy in bengaluru editing by frank mcgurty and paul simao

  Title: Dodgers collaborate with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami on merchandise again. Here's how to get it
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 11:00:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article highlights how the collaboration between Takashi Murakami and the Dodgers, along with the MLB Tokyo Series, successfully captured public attention. The text states, "the overall success of the tokyo series collection delighted murakami" and "i was surprised by the overwhelming response." This suggests that the media coverage and marketing efforts surrounding the event effectively placed it on the public's agenda, leading to increased interest and demand.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions the merchandise hitting the secondary market for four times the purchase price. This suggests a potential imbalance between supply and demand, and raises the question: Was the limited availability of the merchandise intentional to drive up prices and create hype, and if so, what are the ethical implications of such a strategy?; Intriguing_angles: The article notes Murakami's surprise at the overwhelming response in Japan, stating, "honestly, i had thought baseball wasnt as major a sport in japan these days." This suggests a potential disconnect between the artist's perception and the reality of baseball's popularity in Japan. What other assumptions might be influencing the collaboration, and how might these assumptions affect its long-term success?

  Content: a month ago, dodgers gear festooned with colorful flowers in the unmistakable designs of acclaimed japanese artist takashi murakami sold out in minutes at a pop-up on fairfax avenue. a couple hundred angelenos lined up overnight to purchase gear, generating 40 million. the pop-up, called the mlb tokyo series collection, preceded the two-game, season-opening series in japan between the dodgers and chicago cubs, and items soon hit the secondary market for four times the purchase price. the merchandise was so popular that murakami and the dodgers responded by approximating the famous words of hall of fame cubs shortstop ernie banks lets play two! a new collection presented by complex and fanatics will be available april 28 during japanese heritage night at dodger stadium and the dodger clubhouse store, then can be purchased only online. murakami, 63, will throw out the ceremonial first pitch as he did before an exhibition between the dodgers and yomiuri giants at the tokyo dome on march 15. its been two months since i started practicing for the first pitch in tokyo, but given my age, its not so easy to pick up new skills, murakami said playfully in an interview with the times. still, compared to the first day when i couldnt throw the ball at all, ive improved significantly. my hope this time is to throw the ball without it bouncing. some of the dodgers merchandise created in collaboration with japanese artist takashi murakami is shown. complex murakami is unquestionably adept with a brush, a pen or a computer, creating iconic art that features manga, anime, cartoons and brightly colored anthropomorphic cherry blossoms, mushrooms and assorted flowers. he began delivering commissioned projects for luxury brands and celebrities 20 years ago, and a financial pinnacle came in 2008 when his provocative life-size figure my lonesome cowboy sold for 15.1 million at auction. since then murakami has integrated his art on louis vuitton handbags, a kanye west album cover, and the kid cudi collaboration kids see ghosts. he also had a solo exhibition in 2022 at the broad titled takashi murakami stepping on the tail of a rainbow that included sculpture, painting, wallpaper and immersive installations. now his attention has turned to baseball. the mlb tokyo series collection had his familiar colorful flora sprinkled across jerseys, bats, balls, hoodies, flip-flops and a shohei ohtani bobblehead. the surprise medium might have been collaborating with topps on baseball cards. since 2023, i have been creating trading cards and trading card games with my team, so i felt i approached this project with a good understanding of the context, murakami said. but when we filmed the unboxing event for the topps complex series and tokyo series on youtube, i recognized anew how profound the world of american sports trading cards is, which shook me with excitement. the overall success of the tokyo series collection delighted murakami, who said he remembers playing catch with his father as a child. honestly, i had thought baseball wasnt as major a sport in japan these days, so i was surprised by the overwhelming response, he said. i received messages from childhood friends and was approached by neighbors afterwards, which made me realize that baseball remains the beloved sport among the japanese public. the addition of japanese megastars ohtani, yoshinobu yamamoto and roki sasaki made collaborating with the dodgers a natural. the teams popularity in japan has never been greater. the dodgers are the team hideo nomo joined when he first played major league baseball, overcoming various obstacles, murakami said. his success had a significant impact on japanese players entering the majors, and his achievements are vivid in my memory. shohei ohtani joining the dodgers feels like a fateful story for japanese baseball, and im deeply moved by it. in that sense, i consider myself a dodgers fan. murakami added that he has felt comfortable in l.a. since his exhibition at the museum of contemporary art in 2007-2008. i believe my career as an artist in the contemporary art world took off in los angeles, he said. the moca exhibition, curated by paul schimmel, was pivotal in establishing my career in america. whenever i visit los angeles, i feel a strong connection, as if its my second hometown, with fans saying hello to me around the city. so im especially grateful for this new relationship with the dodgers in los angeles.

  Title: Trump announces huge new tariffs to promote US manufacturing, risking inflation and trade wars
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 20:57:51)
  Content: by josh boak associated press washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the new tariffs, coming on what trump has named liberation day, are a bid to boost u.s. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he says are years of unfair trade practices. but by most economists assessments, the move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and upend decades-old alliances. the white house is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble. april 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern american history, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said tuesday. she said the new tariffs would take effect immediately. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. based on the possibility of broad 20 tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. because trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. leavitt is among three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the associated press on first and fifth amendment grounds. the ap says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. the white house says the ap is not following an executive order to refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america. associated press writers mike householder in oldcastle, ontario, sylvie corbet in paris and lisa mascaro contributed to this report.

  Title: Trump's agenda grapples with political and economic reality - BBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-05 00:02:40)
  Content: donald trump, in announcing his sweeping new tariffs on us imports on wednesday, promised that the history books would record 2 april as americas liberation day. after two days of stock market turmoil, however, this may also be remembered as the week the presidents second-term agenda ran headfirst into economic - and political - reality. us stocks have been in a tailspin since trump unveiled his tariffs at wednesday afternoons white house rose garden event, with signs that americas trading partners - canada, the european union and china, most notably - are not backing away from a fight. meanwhile, other presidential efforts, on foreign policy and immigration, and at the ballot box - have faced notable setbacks in recent days. the white house on thursday felt a bit like a building battening down for a coming storm. the four big posters showing americas reciprocal tariffs on a long list of countries were on prominent display in the press briefing room, but administration officials available to respond to media questions were few and far between. out on pennsylvania avenue, workers unloaded pallets of metal fencing, which will ring the white house grounds in preparation for what officials anticipate to be a large anti-trump demonstration at the nearby washington monument on saturday. the first lady announced that a white house garden tour event that had been scheduled for that day was postponed because of security concerns. even the normally loquacious president stopped only briefly to talk with the crush of reporters on his way to board the marine one helicopter on the first leg of his journey to florida. i said this would be exactly the way it is, he declared when asked about the days stock market turmoil. the markets - and america as a whole - would soon boom, he said. the president, it seems, is willing to wait out the tempest created by his tariff plan. he appears confident that his economic vision of a rebuilt, job-rich american manufacturing sector protected from foreign competition - a vision he has closely held for decades - will ultimately be proven right. the trump agendas close encounter with cold, hard reality wasnt limited to trade this week, however. his two top foreign policy priorities - ending the wars in gaza and ukraine - both appear mired in the kind of messy details and conflicting agendas that often obstruct lasting peace. israel has once again moved into gaza and escalated a bombing campaign that is generating reports of widespread civilian casualties. the ceasefire that trump touted in the days before he took office appears to be in tatters. russia, meanwhile, continues to pile new conditions on to negotiations for a full ceasefire with ukraine, which is an indication that the nation may be buying time to allow its ground forces to take more territory. if i think theyre tapping us along, i will not be happy about it, trump said of russia. but he added that he still believes president vladimir putin wants to make a deal. evidence so far indicates the contrary, according to jake sullivan, who was president joe bidens national security adviser. in an interview with the bbc, he accused trump of handing russia most of its demands, though he acknowledged it was still early in the process and things could yet change. so the current dynamic in these negotiations a is not in fact producing russian willingness to reach a fair and just compromise, but b is actually stimulating a view in moscow that if they just keep holding out, theyre just going to keep getting concessions from the united states. and so far that is what has happened. even trumps deportation and immigration enforcement efforts, which still have high public support, have been at least partially derailed by legal challenges. while his administration has successfully completed several flights transferring alleged tren de aragua venezuelan gang members to an el salvadoran high-security prison, the judge presiding over a case challenging those deportations said on thursday there was a fair likelihood officials had violated his court order to turn the flights around. other court challenges - to trumps suspension of political asylum processing and refugee resettlement, his attempt to end birthright citizenship and his revocation of temporary protected status for about 350,000 venezuelans - are currently working their way through the us legal system. at some point, the us supreme court is expected to weigh in on many of these disputes. this week also marked the biggest round of elections since trumps november 2024 victory, as voters headed to the polls in wisconsin to elect a state judge and in two florida special elections for seats in the house of representatives. while the republican candidates in florida prevailed, their winning margins were about 15, which is about half of what trump posted in those congressional districts in november. in wisconsin, a key political battleground state, the democratic-backed candidate won. democrats were able to maintain the liberal majority on the court despite the tens of millions of dollars spent by conservative groups, including by tech billionaire elon musk, who campaigned there in person. taken as a whole the results suggest that democrats are doing well in hotly contested races and may be making inroads even in reliably conservative areas - in part by campaigning against musk and his efforts to massively cut federal programmes and staff. that could be an indication that the party will have the political wind at their backs in state elections this november and the midterm congressional elections next year. the stock market tumult, and those ballot-box results, may be behind a few scattered signs of dissent within republican ranks. ted cruz, an arch-conservative senator from texas, said on his podcast on friday that trumps tariffs could hurt jobs and could hurt america - particularly if other nations retaliate, as china has already done. if were in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now, with massive american tariffs, and massive tariffs on american goods in every other country on earth, that is a terrible outcome, he continued. on wednesday night in the us senate, four republicans joined with democrats to support rescinding the emergency declaration that justifies trumps earlier canada tariffs. and on thursday, republican senator chuck grassley of iowa joined with democrat maria cantwell of washington to back a measure that would require congress to directly approve tariffs that stay in effect longer than 60 days. republicans by and large have been sticking with the president. they seem unwilling, or unable, to sway trump from his current course on tariffs and government cuts and appear fearful of the political consequences of breaking with the man who has a vise-like grip on the party. but if the current economic shock becomes a long-term hardship, and if government programme cuts translate into tangible disruptions in popular services or if trumps standing in opinion polls continues to sag, members of his own party may begin eyeing the exit signs for the first time in years. and that would bring an unceremonious end to some of trumps most ambitious efforts. trump, no longer worried about standing before voters, may feel liberated from the immediate political consequences of his actions - but reality has a way of asserting itself in the end.

  Title: Trump Advisers Say 50-Plus Countries Have Reached Out for Tariff Talks With White House
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-06 18:32:26)
  Content: fort lauderdale, fla. ap top administration officials said sunday that more than 50 countries targeted by president donald trumps new tariffs have reached out to begin negotiations over the sweeping import taxes that have sent financial markets reeling, raised fears of a recession and upended the global trading system. the higher rates are set to be collected beginning wednesday, ushering in a new era of economic uncertainty with no clear end in sight. treasury secretary scott bessent said unfair trade practices are not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks. the united states, he said, must see what the countries offer and whether its believable. trump, who spent the weekend in florida playing golf, posted online that we will win. hang tough, it wont be easy. his cabinet members and economic advisers were out in force sunday defending the tariffs and downplaying the consequences for the global economy. there doesnt have to be a recession. who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week? bessent said. what we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity. trumps tariff blitz, announced april 2, fulfilled a key campaign promise as he acted without congress to redraw the rules of global trade. it was a move decades in the making for trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the u.s. he is gambling that voters will be willing to endure higher prices for everyday items to enact his economic vision. countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with china and others retaliating quickly. top white house economic adviser kevin hassett acknowledged that other countries are angry and retaliating, and, he said, by the way, coming to the table. he cited the office of the u.s. trade representative as reporting that more than 50 nations had reached out to the white house to begin talks. adding to the turmoil, the new tariffs are hitting american allies and adversaries alike, including israel, which is facing a 17 tariff. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is set to visit the white house monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion with trump along with the war in gaza and other issues. another american ally, vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs. trump said vietnams leader said in a telephone call that his country wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s. and a key european partner, italian premier giorgia meloni, said she disagreed with trumps move but was ready to deploy all the tools negotiating and economic necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized. commerce secretary howard lutnick made clear there was no postponing tariffs that are days away. the tariffs are coming. of course they, he said, adding that trump needed to reset global trade. but he committed only to having them definitely remain for days and weeks. in congress, where trumps republican party has long championed free trade, the tariff regiment has been met with applause but also significant unease. several republican senators have already signed onto a new bipartisan bill that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to congress. lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. wyomings john barrasso, the no. 2 member of the senates gop leadership, said trump is doing what he has every right to do. but, he acknowledged, there is concern, and theres concern across the country. people are watching the markets. therell be a discussion in the senate, barrasso said of the tariffs. well see which way the discussion goes. trumps government cost-cutting guru, billionaire businessman elon musk, had been relatively silent on trumps tariffs, but said at a weekend event in italy that he would like to see the u.s. and europe move to a zero-tariff situation. the comment from the tesla owner who leads trumps department of government efficiency drew a rebuke from white house trade adviser peter navarro. elon, when he is on his doge lane, is great. but we understand whats going on here. we just have to understand. elon sells cars, navarro said. he added hes simply protecting his own interest as any business person would do. lawrence summers, an economist who was treasury secretary under democratic president bill clinton, said trump and his economic team are sending contradictory messages if they say they are interested in reviving manufacturing while still being open to negotiating with trade partners. if other countries eliminate their tariffs, and the u.s, does, too, he said, its just making a deal, then we dont raise any revenue nor do we get any businesses to relocate to the united states. if its a permanent revenue source and trying to get businesses to relocate to the united states, then were going to have these tariffs permanently. so the president cant have it both ways. bessent was on nbcs meet the press, hassett and summers appeared on abcs this week, lutnick and barrasso were on cbs face the nation and navarro was interviewed on fox news channels sunday morning futures. ______ associated press writers giada zampano in rome and fatima hussein in jupiter, florida, contributed to this report. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: Trump finally goes all in on tariffs. Free traders on the right and left are furious
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-03 23:05:03)
  Content: analysis the immediate anger and fallout from trumps tariff plan illustrates how a poor u.s. economy could politically isolate the president, writes john bowden from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. free trade advocates in the republican partys old guard piled on donald trump as the stock market tumbled sharply downwards on thursday in response to the white houses tariff plan. wednesdays announcement of across-the-board tariffs on nearly all countries that export goods to the us sent markets spiraling in after-hours trading, which solidified into a steep drop thursday morning. reuters reported that the first us job losses from import tariff hikes were taking place in michigan and indiana, where automaker stellantis announced hundreds of temporary layoffs due to idling production facilities in mexico and canada. signs of the backlash from within conservative circles were already evident wednesday afternoon, as a handful of gop senators including former majority leader mitch mcconnell sided with democrats to condemn the presidents trade action. make no mistake goods made in america will be more expensive to manufacture and, ultimately, for consumers to purchase, with higher broad-based tariffs, mcconnell said after his vote. center-right media hammered trump on thursday while us allies showed no signs of backing down and instead openly plotted their own tariff measures in response. a trade war appears imminent on the road ahead. assuming the policy sticksand we hope it doesntthe effort amounts to an attempt to remake the u.s. economy and the world trading system, the murdoch-owned wall street journal editorial board wrote thursday morning. if the response is widespread retaliation, the result could be shrinking world trade and slower growth, recession, or worse, the journal continued. there will certainly be higher costs for american consumers and businesses. on the bulwark, host jonathan last sarcastically quipped thursday the woke socialist markets do not seem to appreciate the brilliance of trumps beautiful, very strong tariffs. the white house fired out its own news release highlighting praise from a handful of industry trade groups, as well as republican members of congress. but over wednesday evening and thursday morning the media and economic experts spent the hours picking apart apparent inconsistencies and other confusing aspects of the liberation day announcement. a top target of ridicule for the white houses usual critics were the 10 percent duties levied on the heard and mcdonald islands, a remote pair of islands controlled by australia with no human population and extremely limited fishing activity, according to forbes. virtually zero exports from the penguin-infested rocks reach the us. impressed the crack white house economic team not only found the heard and mcdonald islandsan uninhabited australian territory which is a two week sail from the mainland requiring a permit to visitbut that they managed to figure out the optimal retaliatory tariff to impose on penguins, wrote justin wolfers, a senior fellow at the brookings institution. on consumer news channel cnbc, one reporter could not hide his disdain for the formula used to calculate the reciprocal tariffs put into place by the white house, which according to a number of economists did not appear to actually factor in tariffs put into place by us trade partners. i started calling international trade economic experts, steve liesman said on the network thursday morning. nobody ever heard of this formula. nobody has ever used this formula. so im sorry, but the conclusion seems to be that the president kind of made this up as he went along. he made it up. ian bremmer of the eurasia group, added this is incredibly stupid. yales nonpartisan budget lab was out with increasingly dire predictions for the us economy after the presidents announcement this week. clothing and apparel prices are set to spike by nearly 20 percent nationwide, according to an analysis published wednesday, while the overall economy will shrink and american households in the middle income bracket will be hit with an annual income loss of around 1,700. i expect the fallout to continue into next week, as everyone is trying to assess what the effect will be on final consumer prices, michael tamvakis, a professor and economist with city st. georges university of london, told the independent on thursday. i imagine any good not available in the domestic us market will be affected, especially any food commodities which have to be imported promptly and have a short shelf life, tamvakis predicted. electronics, pharmaceuticals and auto sales would be among the sectors affected immediately, he explained, with higher drug prices in particular having the potential to hurt poorer americans the most. with the trump administration under a self-acknowledged mandate to bring down consumer prices and inflation, the president could be setting republicans up in a very uncomfortable spot come midterm season. the state of the us economy is likely to be very close to the top of voters minds as congressional reelection campaigns begin in earnest next year and later in 2024, for some. high grocery prices and other issues caused by a trade war could easily lead voters to hand the house back to democratic control for the remainder of trumps term, even if the senate remains out of reach. the real danger trump faces could be from dividing the coalition which has now elected him twice traditional republican voters who want to see the us economy grow and thrive, and maga true believers who are willing to see a contraction if it means reorganizing the economy under an america first vision. democrats, of course, are counting on this as their party continues to grapple with a crisis of confidence. voters remain unhappy with congressional democrats, especially senate minority leader chuck schumer, amid the doge-ification of the federal government and the collapse of democratic resistance in the senate, both in the face of the laken riley act and more recent government shutdown fight. schumer, who saw his party shed three seats in the senate last year, maintains that he still has a winning record in terms of both elections and legislating. a tanking us economy could make that pronouncement a reality come next year. if trump doesnt see things turn around for the us economy before the end of the year, he could well end up handing schumer a lifeline right when his rival needs it most. join thought-provoking

  Title: Analysis-Trump Uses Power Against Foes Unlike Any Other Modern US President
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-02 05:05:38)
  Content: by james oliphant and jeff mason washington reuters -in just 10 weeks in office, donald trump has imposed his will on perceived adversaries in business, politics, the media and allied nations by leveraging power in ways no other modern u.s. president has tried. his administration has sought the arrest and deportation of student protesters, withheld federal funds from colleges, ostracized law firms tied to his political opponents, threatened judges and tried to pressure journalists. at the same time trump has downsized the federal government dramatically and purged it of workers who could stand in his way. central to this effort has been trumps use of policy-making executive orders to target opponents as never before. he has been unafraid to employ lawsuits, public threats and the power of the federal purse to bring institutions to heel. what unites all these efforts is trumps desire to shut down every potential source of resistance to the maga agenda and to his personal power, said peter shane, a law professor at new york university. some targets have rushed to placate the president, a few have fought back and many are still trying to figure out how to respond. many of trumps actions are being challenged in courts, where some judges have tried to slow him down. the stunning speed and breadth of the republican presidents actions have caught democrats, public-service unions, ceos and the legal profession off guard. trumps supporters say he is simply using the full reach of his presidency to achieve the goals he set as a candidate. hes laid out these broad battle lines, whether its with people that he thinks have tried to ruin him personally, whether its with people he thinks have tried to ruin western civilization, said republican strategist scott jennings, a longtime adviser to senator mitch mcconnell. everything he said he was going to do on the campaign, hes doing. trumps aims are not just political. his actions show he wants to reorder american society with an all-powerful executive at the top, where financial, political and cultural institutions carry his stamp and where opposition is either co-opted or curtailed. with a compliant congress controlled by his party and a u.s. supreme court dominated by conservatives, trump is operating with fewer checks on his power than any of his modern-day predecessors. trump has attempted to subdue and cajole his adversaries on an almost-daily basis, backed by the fearsome might of the law enforcement and regulatory agencies at his command. he has often succeeded. he managed to wring concessions out of several of his targets, including storied columbia university, powerful law firms and corporate titans such as meta and disney. all of them settled with the white house rather than endure the pressure, surrendering some independence and setting what some view as damaging precedents. others are taking preemptive measures to avoid trumps wrath. more than 20 of americas largest companies and financial firms, including goldman sachs, google and pepsico, have rolled back diversity programs that had drawn trumps ire. three law firms cut deals with the administration rather than risk losing their lawyers security clearances, access to government buildings and perhaps, as a result, clients, while three others targeted by trumps executive orders sued in response. trumps orders have also been his vehicle to remake the government, deport alleged venezuelan gang members with little due process and levy tariffs against u.s. trading partners. he has sued u.s. media corporations and silenced the voice of america, taken control of the kennedy center, a leading arts facility, and sought to put curbs on the smithsonian institution, whose mission is to chronicle history. his administration has detained student protesters whose political views it says are a threat to the country. trump has pushed a mineral-rights deal on ukraines leadership with the veiled threat of ending u.s. support for kyiv in the russian war in ukraine. he has threatened nato ally denmark to try to wrest control of greenland, spoken of annexing canada and threatened to take the panama canal back from its home country. tailored strikes mark zaid, a washington lawyer who represents whistleblowers against the federal government and who himself had his security clearance stripped away by trump, said the presidents conduct is like nothing he has seen in his 30-year career. executive orders have never been designed to specifically target individuals nor non-government actors for purposes of retaliation or retribution, zaid said. the white house and trumps allies deny the president is acting out of revenge. a white house spokesman said more traditional approaches have failed to bring meaningful change. unconventional is precisely what the american people voted for when they elected president trump, white house spokesman harrison fields said. the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy. in his first term from 2017-2021, trump was hamstrung by a variety of factors a federal probe into russian interference, his aides lack of experience and greater democratic opposition in congress. with those roadblocks gone, an emboldened trump has demonstrated at the start of his second term that he has learned how to use the resources available to him more fully to get what he wants. he really does know how to pull the levers of power this time, more so than last time, said rina shah, a republican strategist. claire wofford, a political science professor at the college of charleston, said trump has used executive orders not only to push forward a policy agenda, but also to send messages to his political base, as in his attempt to scale back birthright citizenship, and to test the limits of his power, as with his invocation of an 18th-century law to designate some migrants as alien enemies. what strikes me most at this point is how strategic trump is - but in new ways, wofford said. funding and litigation in cases such as with columbia university, trump has used the federal purse as a cudgel, concluding his targets have financial interests that make them vulnerable to coercion. in other cases, he has used the courts, forcing companies such as disney and meta into favorable settlements after trump filed lawsuits against them. cbs news, another trump lawsuit target, is under pressure to settle its suit because its parent, paramount, is eager to have its proposed merger with skydance media approved by trump administration regulators. but not every institution has bent the knee. many of trumps actions, particularly those regarding his cuts in government, remain tied up in federal court. in the last two weeks alone, judges have ruled against trump in matters challenging his deportation policies, attacks against law firms and plans to eliminate government agencies. in response, trump and his allies have called for judges who rule against the administration to be impeached and drawn a rare rebuke from chief justice john roberts. walter olson, a senior fellow at the libertarian cato institute, said trumps attacks on law firms and judges are without precedent and are reminiscent of other nations with authoritarian regimes. clipping the wings of law firms and the courts, olson said, is the behavior of an autocrat. reporting by james oliphant and jeff masonediting by colleen jenkins and howard goller

street opened on thursday morning after donald trump unveiled his latest wave of tariffs on what the president called liberation day. trumps announcement sent shockwaves through markets around the globe, and shortly after the bell rang at the new york stock exchange, the dow jones industrial average fell 1,150 points or 2.7. the sp 500 dropped more than 3, and the tech-focused nasdaq more than 4.2. the president announced that blanket 10 percent tariffs will be imposed on all nations in a speech at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden shortly after regular trading hours closed in the u.s. about 60 countries deemed the worst offenders including china where a majority of apples devices are manufactured face higher reciprocal levies nearing, in some cases, 50 percent leaving world leaders reeling. the baseline tariffs go into effect on saturday and reciprocal tariffs on wednesday. meanwhile, four republican senators joined every democratic senator in a resolution to oppose trumps tariffs against canada. the senate passed the resolution crafted by kentucky senator rand paul 51-48 on wednesday after trumps announcement. a senate hearing devolved into chaos after sen. ted cruz repeatedly spoke over sen. amy klobuchar as the pair exchanged barbs over nationwide injunctions inhibiting president donald trumps agenda. during wednesdays hearing, the texas lawmaker excoriated federal judges and declared that nationwide injunctions are an abuse of power. cruzs comments come as republicans are attempting to pass a bill to limit judicial rulings against the trump administration. james liddell reports. andrew feinberg and katie hawkinson report from washington, d.c. far-right activist laura loomer met with president donald trump and pressed him to fire several members of the national security council and reports indicate he has taken her advice. trump fired several members of the national security council, including senior directors, after the meeting, axios reports. one u.s. official told the outlet the firings are shaping up to be a bloodbath. the new yorktimes added that at least three senior nsc officials have been fired. this comes after times first reported loomer met with trump, vice president jd vance, national security adviser mike waltz and others in the oval office on wednesday, armed with extensive research she believed worked against several staffers. donald trumps press secretary has claimed that he is partly responsible for a spiritual revival in america and is helping people move closer to god. karoline leavitt, a practicing roman catholic, said that evidence of renewed faith, especially within younger generations, was becoming more visible and that it was a beautiful sight. mike bedigan has the story. an economic analyst says the 50 percent reciprocal trade tariff on lesotho will kill the tiny southern african kingdom that the u.s. president ridiculed last month. spains prime minister has led european leaders in condemning donald trumps sweeping tariffs. pedro sanchez, whose country sells large amounts of car parts, steel and chemicals to the us, described the move to bring in reciprocal tariffs on imported goods from the eu as unintelligent and a return to 19th-century protectionism. steffie banatvala reports. its midday in new york, two and half hours since markets opened on wall street, and initial losses on the major indices appear to have leveled out for now and even recovered slightly from their trading low points. they all remain significantly down from the opening. the dow jones industrial average is now down 1,296 points 3.11 the sp 500 is down 215 points 3.79 and the tech-focused nasdaq has lost 863 points 4.90. canada will impose a 25 tariff on all vehicles imported from the united states that are not compliant with the u.s.-mexico-canada trade deal, prime minister mark carney told a press conference on thursday. carney also said the new tariffs would not apply to auto parts and would not affect vehicle content from mexico. two senior lawmakers on the senate finance committee introduced legislation on thursday aimed at limiting u.s. president donald trumps ability to impose tariffs and requiring congressional approval for new levies within 60 days. republican senator chuck grassley and democrat maria cantwell presented a bill that mandates the president to notify congress about new tariffs, providing an explanation of the rationale along with an analysis of the potential impact on u.s. businesses and consumers. congress must pass a joint resolution of approval for the new tariff within 60 days otherwise, all new tariffs on imports would expire. this bill reasserts congress role over trade policy to ensure rules-based trade policies are transparent, consistent, and benefit the american public, cantwell said. as representatives of the american people, congress has a duty to stop actions that will cause them harm. the bill is based on the war powers resolution of 1973 and aims to reestablish limits on the presidents authority to impose unilateral tariffs without congressional approval. for too long, congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch, grassley said. grassleys home state of iowa relies significantly on farm crop exports, whereas cantwells washington state hosts many export-driven companies like boeing. the senate passed legislation on wednesday that would terminate new tariffs on canada. with reporting from reuters the newsmax team and former trump lawyer and ally rudy giuliani got to ring the opening bell at the new york stock exchange this morning. bit of a shame for them that it was on a day when the presidents

  Content: the first signs of an internal us political backlash against donald trumps declaration of a global trade war are starting to emerge amid tanking stock markets worldwide, including on wall street, and widespread international criticism of the move. hours after trump unveiled a sweeping panoply of tariffs in an event he dubbed liberation day, four republican senators openly defied him by voting for a senate resolution from democrats demanding that the 25 tariffs on canadian products be reversed. the resolution lacks the force of law but its support from mitch mcconnell and rand paul, both of kentucky, susan collins of maine, and lisa murkowski of alaska, immediately signaled the deep misgivings among some republicans over trumps tariff gambit, which has triggered a global sell-off. mcconnell, the former senate majority leader, issued a scathing denunciation after wednesday evenings vote, calling tariffs bad policy that would trigger economic hardship. trade wars with our partners hurt working people most, he said in a statement. tariffs drive up the cost of goods and services. they are a tax on everyday working americans. further criticism came from trumps former vice-president, mike pence, who called the tariffs the largest peacetime tax hike in us history. these tariffs are nearly 10 times the size of those imposed during the trump-pence administration, and will cost american families over 3,500 per year, he posted. the four republicans who voted with democrats did so despite a public appeal from trump not to support the resolution, tabled by tim kaine, a democratic senator for virginia who was hillary clintons running mate in the 2016 presidential election, which trump won. the resolution was aimed at curtailing the powers trump claimed under the international emergency economic powers act, which he has invoked to tackle the uss 1.2tn trade deficit and, in the case of canada, cited the influx of fentanyl through its border. mcconnell pulled no punches in his attack on trumps policy. preserving the long-term prosperity of american industry and workers requires working with our allies, not against them. with so much at stake globally, the last thing we need is to pick fights with the very friends with whom we should be working with to protect against chinas predatory and unfair trade practices, he said. he added at a time when americans are tightening their belts, we would do well to avoid policies that heap on the pain. we ought to strengthen our friendships abroad, and reinforce our allies as pillars of american prosperity and security. paul, his fellow kentuckian, said the tariffs were unconstitutional. our constitution was very specific that taxes tariffs are a tax taxes originate in the house, come to the senate and then go the president, he told reporters. they dont just go to the president and no one else. what kind of system would it be if all of our taxes and laws were passed by one person? he later told fox news trade is proportional to wealth. the last 70 years of international trade has been an exponential curve upwards, and the last 70 years of prosperity has been upwards also. we are richer because of trade with canada, and so is canada. collins, the senator for maine, said tariffs would damage lobstering, agriculture and the pulp and paper industries in her state, which borders canada. she also lambasted imposing tariffs on us allies. the fact is, the vast majority of fentanyl in america comes from the southern border rather than from canada, she said on the senate floor. one of my biggest concerns is we should be distinguishing between allies and our adversaries and not treating them the same way. murkowski, a senator from alaska, said tariffs would also hurt her state and urged trump to find a better way to mutually secure our borders and address fentanyl trafficking than by starting a trade war. while not all canadian trade practices are fair, im keenly aware of the negative impacts in store for alaskan families and businesses should tariffs drive up the costs of essential goods, she posted on x. in alaska we share more than 1,538 miles of border with canada. we are friends, neighbors, partners, and allies when it comes to our economies, our mutual defense, our cultures, and, yes, our trade. the outspoken republican criticism hinted at a wider unease in the party that is mostly being kept muted for fear of repercussions from trump. thom tillis, a republican senator for north carolina, warned about potential irreparable damage to his farming constituents before wednesdays announcement. anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right need to talk to my farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy, he told cnn. they dont have time. so weve got to be crisp on this implementation. john thune, the republican senate majority leader, tried to reconcile his concerns with loyalty to trump. ive got my issue. i represent a state that is very dependent upon exports, he told reporters. but i do appreciate the presidents focus on making sure were getting better deals, and giving business an incentive to do business here in the united states. such equivocation contrasted with unambiguous condemnation from democrats, some of whom openly lauded the republican anti-tariff rebels. this is what happens when people speak up, posted the new jersey senator, cory booker, citing images of news headlines about the four senators votes and obliquely referencing his record-breaking senate floor speech this week denouncing trumps policies. chuck schumer, the democratic leader in the senate, posted 54 tariffs on china, 10 tariffs on iran, 0 tariffs on russia alongside a puzzled emoji. brian schatz, a hawaii senator and the democrats chief whip, posted ive never seen a president ruin the economy on purpose. responding, chris murphy, the outspoken connecticut senator who has emerged as an articulate advocate of the need for a democratic anti-trump fightback, wrote this is the thing to understand. its all on purpose. creating chaos and crisis.

  Title: Donald Trump’s Tariff Blitz Is Political Suicide - New York Magazine
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-03 16:06:11)
  Content: save this article to read it later. find this story in your accounts saved for later section. give donald trump some credit he is following through, absolutely, on a campaign promise. while few americans imagined that electing trump again would make elon musk a de facto president, tasked with eviscerating the federal bureaucracy, it was no secret that tariffs would be on the menu if trump returned to the white house. tariffs and trade deficits have been a trump obsession for decades. he could be heard talking them up in the 1980s and 1990s, and he has long romanticized a protectionist economy. and while trumps liberation day tariffs are unnecessarily punitive and ultimately counterproductive in an inflationary environment, not all of them can be dismissed out of hand. it is true that globalization and free-trade agreements crippled onetime industrial powerhouses in the northeast and midwest. the white and black working classes were punished in cities like gary and youngstown and detroit as manufacturers fled the country and cheap, foreign-produced clothing, toys, and automobiles flooded the market. joe bidens industrial policy targeted china for tariffs on electric vehicles and solar panels, and there are plenty of reasons for trump to continue or even stiffen tariffs on our greatest geopolitical rival. it is true, as his treasury secretary, scott bessent, recently said, that the american dream is not merely access to cheap goods. the american worker shouldnt suffer so another export champion overseas can flourish. of course, trump is trump, and there is no subtlety to his latest tariffs and no sense of proportion. trump announced a 10 percent universal tariff on all goods barring certain exemptions imported into the u.s., beginning april 5. goods from china were hit with an enormous tariff rate of 54 percent. japan was taxed at 24 percent, europe at 20 percent, and there are many more reciprocal tariffs, which will take effect on april 9. this morning, a 25 percent tariff on all automobile imports kicked in. canada and mexico, already targeted for tariffs, were not a focus of the so-called liberation day. various analysts rate these tariffs as among the very highest in american history, surpassing the smoot-hawley tariff act of 1930 and rivaling the protectionist regimes of the 1890s. an open question remains how long they will last or if most of them represent yet another trump negotiating tactic. bessent seemed to suggest that the tariffs could be provisional. one of the messages that id like to get out tonight is everybody sit back take a deep breath dont immediately retaliate. lets see where this goes, he said, according to cnn. because if you retaliate, thats how we get escalation. if the tariffs hold, trade wars are coming and life is going to get more expensive, whether american manufacturing glory is restored or not. inflation could increase, and the economy may, in the short term, tip toward a recession. for the market-conscious trump, it will be grim times on wall street, which wrongly gambled that trump wasnt serious about levying heavy tariffs on americas trading partners. investors are bound to get more skittish. the postelection stock-market gains have already been wiped out. this is the real problem for trump. his calling card has always been the economy. as democrats, throughout his first term, fulminated about the state of the republic, trump could point to low inflation, low interest rates, and a strong stock market. during bidens presidency, americans felt nostalgia for the pre-pandemic 2010s, and that was trumps time in the sun. as much as they may have found his conduct disconcerting, voters believed he could be an adequate steward of the economy. individual presidents cant wholly dictate economic conditions, but its inarguable that trump, less radicalized than he is today, did relatively little to destabilize the 2010ss financial environment. tariffs were reasonable, the federal bureaucracy was preserved, and the gop-run congress failed in its politically toxic bid to destroy the affordable care act. surveys already show trump posting poorer numbers on the economy. his strong suit is gone, and its probably not coming back not with tariffs, doge, or attempts to gut medicaid. there is virtually nothing trump is doing in his second term to improve the everyday reality of working-class people. mass layoffs of federal employees merely punish those who had stable jobs and make interacting with crucial bureaucracies like the department of veterans affairs all the more challenging. a stiff tariff wont lower a grocery bill. and if republicans do follow through on their bid to lower the deficit by slashing medicaid, which offers health care to some 70 million americans plenty of them republicans in rural areas the backlash will be severe. the bloom is already off the maga rose. the wisconsin supreme court race was a devastating outcome for the trump-musk wing of the party at this point perhaps its only real wing and an indication of where we are probably headed. democrats and independents are furious and ready to vote against trump-aligned candidates. had elise stefanik not been returned to her district in the north country, theres an outside chance that a special election there could have turned a deep-red seat blue. if trump is serious about bringing back 1930s- or 1890s-style protectionism to america, he should consult a history textbook and find out what happened to the republican governments that instituted the tariffs. neither of them survived, with herbert hoover, in the teeth of the great depression, giving way to franklin d. roosevelt and a democratic majority that wouldnt be broken for a generation. democrats have a long, long way to go to reach their fdr-era heights. but trump, through his chaos, is helping them along plenty. by submitting your email, you agree to our terms and

  Title: Patricia Murphy: ‘Liberation Day’ for the economy? Georgia already did that, without tariffs - AJC.com
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-02 10:36:13)
  Content: are you ready for liberation day, georgia? no longer will you be oppressed by your neighbors bmw in the driveway or the flat-screen tv you bought for christmas. you only bought the bigger tv because it came from costco and also from china. but you wont have that problem much longer, either. thats because wednesday is the day president donald trump has promised to liberate the american economy with a swath of 25 tariffs on entire countries, sectors, or imported goods and materials. some countrys tariffs could be much higher or totally eliminated, based on the presidents choices, which trump said hell unveil late wednesday afternoon in a rose garden ceremony. other countries have been ripping us off for 50 years, maybe longer, theyve been ripping us off from the beginning, trump explained monday in the oval office, with a red, white and blue-bedazzled kid rock standing next to him. we help everybody, and they dont help us. the president didnt give exact details, but he said new levies will hit anyone and everyone not making their products in america. and if a country retaliates with new tariffs on american products, he warned, whatever they charge us, were going to charge them. the friend, in many cases, is worse than the foe. that may be true for trump. but if he needs an example of how to jump-start american manufacturing with the opposite approach, he could skip the tariff announcement and drive south to georgia, where new factories are rising along interstates from rome to savannah and lagrange to commerce. the current georgia manufacturing boom is courtesy of gov. brian kemp and a long line of governors before him, all the way back to democratic gov. george busbee, who looked overseas for new markets, new allies and new customers for whatever georgia was selling. although previous international trade deals hollowed out the states textile manufacturing sector, new deals have backfilled those losses, particularly in rural areas of the state where the jobs were most needed. today, instead of threatening potential trading partners, kemp makes it a point to go to them, traveling to korea, france, israel, germany or other countries multiple times a year to meet foreign leaders and businesses and pitch them on making their products in georgia. honored to meet with president yoon to reflect on the stronger than ever partnership and prosperity between georgia and the republic of korea, was a typical post on social media from kemp last year. along with the charm offensive, the georgia bargain has included inexpensive land, relatively low-cost, nonunion labor and generous tax breaks some would say too generous for companies that plant their roots here. crucially, state leaders have worked to strengthen the states university system and start the quickstart program through the states technical colleges, which trains local workers for specific companies and industries. the result of all of that has been new overseas markets for georgia exports and new foreign investments in the state, the largest of which has been hyundais 7.6 billion metaplant outside of savannah. kemp was at the plant last week for its grand opening, where the chairman of hyundai motor group announced theyve already decided to boost production by two-thirds there. gov. kemp, gov. nathan deal and gov. sonny perdue all took the approach to business and economic development that investment is like water water follows the path of least resistance, said butch miller, the gop senate majority leader during kemps first term as governor. if you set barriers and hurdles to investment and business, itll go in a different direction. miller is no longer in politics, but he is still a honda dealer in gainesville. he said that if the trump tariffs are high and sustained, they will reshape the auto industry forever. companies may eventually bring more manufacturing to the u.s. under duress, but the process could be long and painful. itll mean higher prices for consumers, because the tariffs will increase the cost of imported vehicles and auto parts, he said. also complicating the equation is the multinational nature of modern manufacturing. as an example, he pointed to a single piston, which is made of aluminum smelted in canada, shaped in detroit, shipped to mexico to be put into a car engine, and then imported back to the u.s. for final assembly. how many times is the piston taxed? overall, he concluded, id take the kemp-deal-perdue approach. chris clark, the president and ceo of the georgia chamber of commerce, said he hears anxiety about new tariffs coming from farmers, who export everything from poultry and cotton, as well as from manufacturers who import components for their final products, and from foreign companies with operations here. there is just a lot of concern about the repercussions that could come for all of them, he said of trumps tariffs. like butch miller, clark said georgia leaders have taken the proactive, relationship-based approach to increasing trade. in the carrot versus stick approach to making deals, the carrot just works better. i say that all the time at the georgia capitol please give us the carrot. we much prefer to be incentivized to do something. thats obviously the preference of business, clark said. the other preference is just stability. tell us what the rules are. give us time to adjust to the rules. we thrive in consistency. who wants to tell the new yorker in the white house that tax breaks and southern hospitality, not threats and tariffs against our closest allies, are the way to make american manufacturing great again? in georgia, its already working. patricia murphy joined the ajc in 2020 from cq roll call, where she was a nationally syndicated political columnist. she previously covered politics for the daily beast and politics daily, and wrote for the washington post and garden gun. she graduated from vanderbilt university and holds a masters degree in journalism from columbia university. credit the atlanta journal-constitution president donald trump has repeatedly called april 2 liberation day, with promises to roll out a set of tariffs, or taxes on imports from other countries. credit arvin temkarajc credit jenni girtman public health experts say the cdc cuts could represent generational damage to health research and the elimination of infectious diseases. i had a long and impactful conversation with him, the atlanta falcons owner said at the nfl annual meeting on tuesday. new details still have investigators asking questions about the death of the rapper, who police say died after falling while running from officers responding to a 911 call.

  Title: Trump ‘Liberation Day’ live: President set to unveil secret tariff plan as world braces for its economic impact
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-02 14:47:57)
  Content: all eyes are on president trump as he prepares to reveal the next phase of his sweeping tariff agenda, leaving global markets fearing a trade war from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. donald trump is preparing to unveil a raft of new tariffs on wednesday afternoon in what the president has repeatedly billed as liberation day. trump has promised to roll out reciprocal dollar-for-dollar tariffs on nations that levy duties on u.s. goods as part of an aggressive attempt to fulfill his administrations america first agenda and correct years of what he deems unfair trade. international markets wait tentatively as the president is expected to unveil his plans at 4 p.m. wednesday at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden at the moment american markets close. plans remain under wraps with trumps team reportedly weighing options through tuesday. however, white house press secretary karoline leavitt stated that the president had already decided his course of action and that the tariffs would go into effect almost immediately. the only way to avoid the new levies, she said, is to move production to the u.s. it follows the liberal candidate for a critical seat on the wisconsin supreme court, susan crawford, who defeated conservative brad schimel in a race seen as a referendum on trump and his billionaire adviser elon musk. former republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is on board with an effort by democrats in the upper chamber led by senators tim kaine, amy klobuchar, and mark warner to end donald trumps made-up emergency that the president has declared against canada allowing him authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on the u.s.s northern neighbor. trump claims the authority by declaring a national emergency caused by the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migration from canada as well as mexico and china. president trump is saying that there is an emergency with canada. canada is a friend, not an adversary. canada is a sovereign nation, not a 51st state, senator kaine of virginia said on tuesday. this morning, cnns haley talbot reports that the list of republicans who will vote yes on a tariffs resolution up for a vote today at around 7 p.m. has grown to include the former gop leader of the senate. kaine said he approached mcconnell last night and didnt even get to the question before the kentucky senator said im with you. other republicans in support of the move to at least symbolically rebuke the president on his trade policy just a few hours after his liberation day announcement on reciprocal tariffs expected to cover a large swathe of u.s. trading partners include senators susan collins, lisa murkowski, and rand paul. senator thom tillis also told cnn that he doesnt plan on voting for kaines resolution, but has some concerns with the trade policies being discussed, adding, we need to see what comes out tomorrow wednesday and be instructed by that before we take action. earlier, trump wrote in part on truth social mitch mcconnell of kentucky, susan collins of maine, lisa murkowski of alaska, and rand paul, also of kentucky, will hopefully get on the republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize canada for the sale, into our country, of large amounts of fentanyl, by tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy. they are playing with the lives of the american people, and right into the hands of the radical left democrats and drug cartels. the senate bill is just a ploy of the dems to show and expose the weakness of certain republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the house will never approve it and i, as your president, will never sign it. after breaking the record for the longest senate speech in history, cory booker now seems to have broken the internet, with a slew of praise, memes and even tiktok videos commemorating his mammoth achievement. the new jersey democrat took to the senate floor on monday evening, saying he would remain there as long as he was physically able. the speech lasted a whopping 25 hours and 5 minutes. mike bedigan looks at some of the online reactions. it was fitting that cory booker was recounting a story about the late civil rights leader john lewis as he entered the 19th minute and 24th hour of a historic speech to the senate on tuesday evening. in that moment, the first black senator for new jersey broke a record for the longest speech ever made in congress, one that was set 67 years ago by the segregationist democrat strom thurmond, who spoke for a day and a night in opposition to the civil rights act. overcome with emotion, booker looked up to the ceiling and touched his heart as his fellow democrats in the chamber applauded his effort. one of msnbcs morning joe hosts is delighting in the fact that the wisconsin supreme court candidate backed by elon musks lost - even after the tech mogul dumped millions into the race. wisconsin voters elected liberal justice susan crawford to the states supreme court on tuesday, beating brad schimel by more than 200,000 votes in the most expensive judicial election in u.s. history. the vote keeps the high courts 4-3 liberal majority intact. musk repeatedly played up the stakes of the election, claiming it will direct the destiny of humanity and the future of the world is at stake. now, morning joe host joe scarborough is reveling in the massive loss musk suffered. katie hawkinson reports from washington, d.c. the u.s. has sent a three-person team to myanmar to help respond to the 7.7-magnitude earthquake, in a move criticized as weak and irrelevant by a former aid official. much larger russian and chinese teams have already been helping search-and-rescue efforts in the country for days. steffie banatvala reports. a mother and her three children were wrongfully detained by immigration enforcement agents in new york and taken to a detention facility in texas, a nonprofit says as it calls for their release. immigration and customs enforcement officers detained the mother - whose birth country was not disclosed - and her kids, one of whom is in third grade, on march 27 while they were executing an arrest on a farm in sackets harbor, new york, according to the new york immigration coalition. kelly rissman reports. elon musk broke his silence after suffering defeat in the wisconsin supreme court race, which cemented a liberal majority for the next three years. susan crawfords win keeps the court under a 4-3 liberal majority in the face of crucial litigation surrounding abortion access, voting rights and redistricting. like president donald trump, musk chose to focus on the background win of wisconsin voters approving the constitutional amendment to enshrine voter id laws, a vote that was being held at the same time as the supreme court race. this was the most important thing, musk posted on x in response to a post on voter id. madeline sherratt has the full story. kelly loeffler, former georgia senator and now head of the small business administration in the trump administration, hailed donald trumps liberation day as the single greatest salvation, for not just small businesses, but for america, during an appearance on fox business this morning. the president eagerly posted a clip of her conversation with maria bartiromo to his truth social account italys prime minister giorgia meloni and the countrys top business lobby warned on wednesday that impending u.s. tariffs could significantly impact the nations exports and its already struggling economy. it is clear that the introduction of new tariffs would have heavy repercussions for italian producers, meloni said while hosting a prize-giving ceremony for italian cuisine in rome. meloni added that she did not rule out adequate responses to protect the exports of the euro zones third largest economy, though she did not provide further details. italy recorded a trade surplus with the united states of 39 billion euros 42.14 billion in 2024, the third largest in the 20-nation euro area, according to eurostat data. earlier on wednesday, the business association confindustria reported that italys economy is expected to grow by 0.6 this year, half of the governments official target and down from a 0.9 forecast made by the group in october. the economy expanded by a modest 0.7 in both 2024 and 2023. it managed to achieve 0.1 growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the previous three months, after stagnating in the third quarter. most analysts do not foresee any significant rebound in the near term. confindustria indicated that while its forecasts accounted for the already-announced u.s. tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as what it termed record levels of uncertainty regarding trade policy, they did not consider the effects of an escalating trade war. in a worst-case scenario, with permanent 25 u.s. tariffs on all imports, rising to 60 for china, coupled with retaliatory measures against u.s. exports, italys growth could decline to around 0.2 this year, it said. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: How Trump has paved the way for new GOP policy fights: From the Politics Desk - NBC News
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-17 22:09:08)
  Content: welcome to the online version of from the politics desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the nbc news politics teams latest reporting and analysis from the white house, capitol hill and the campaign trail. in todays edition, jonathan allen explores how the major policy fights in washington are happening within the republican party. plus, after we noted yesterday that outspoken progressives are seeing an influx of campaign cash, natasha korecki and bridget bowman dive further into how the anti-trump 2.0 resistance is starting to find its footing. sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. as they stare into the abyss of rising national debt, republicans are starting to talk about the possibility of raising taxes on the wealthy. yes, you read that right, and nbc news sahil kapur and peter nicholas have the reporting to back it up. since the days of george h.w. bushs breaking his read my lips promise, republicans have run for the hills any time a tax hike is mentioned. now, that option is part of a sprawling, animated and consequential set of policy fights between the ascendent populist wing of the gop and the grasping-for-relevance old guard conservatives. what happened? president donald trump. his eagerness to take both sides on certain issues sometimes in a single sentence allows him to maintain the dominant voice on public policy and makes it harder for his adversaries to pin him down. in his second term, fellow republicans are starting to adjust. as long as they support him in the end, they are freer to take positions against one another and party orthodoxy before he makes a final call. its not just on domestic taxes. trumps on-again, off-again tariffs may be a threat to the economy and his long-term political success. but in the interim, they have upset traditional washington partisan paradigms and blocked out coverage of other issues. while progressives bernie sanders and alexandria ocasio-cortez hold rallies across the country, bringing tens of thousands of people to rallies that accuse trump of selling out the working class to line the pockets of the wealthiest people in the country, the maga wing of the gop is rhetorically and in some cases on a policy level arguing for a stick-it-to-the-rich agenda. the dynamic is still nascent, but its somewhat reminiscent of the mid-20th century era of democratic dominance in congress when a party that was on both sides of civil rights, both sides of foreign policy and both sides of the distribution of benefits held all the power and had all the energy in policymaking. the cart, of course, should not be put before the horse. there are plenty of reasons to think that the gop wont actually increase the tax burden on the wealthiest. after all, trump is in the process of gutting the irs, which already under-collects hundreds of billions of dollars in owed taxes, mostly from the rich. but for now, at least, the trump model of triangulating against himself and of fellow republicans following suit is making it even harder for the democratic minority to lock on a target and define its own agenda. in the red state of montana on wednesday, a crowd swelled for two political stars of the left, sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., and rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., who vowed to fight oligarchy in president donald trumps administration. that night, rep. nikki budzinski, d-ill., had her largest-ever town hall crowd, with many people wanting to know how democrats were pushing back. and hours later, sen. chris van hollen, d-md., traveled to el salvador to bring attention to a case at the center of the partys arguments that trumps immigration policies have gone beyond existing law and court orders. those events of the last 24 hours point to a similar phenomenon in ways big and small, the second-term resistance to trump is growing stronger and bolder. the pushback is from not just politicians but also some of the powerful institutions that have come under attack by the administration. they include harvard university, the massachusetts institute of technology and princeton, all of which refused to yield to a list of trump demands that would overhaul hiring, disciplinary and other practices in the face of billions of dollars in federal funding freezes. while it is far from a full-fledged revolt, more of those being targeted by trumps policies are putting up a fight now, compared with the universities, law firms and even democratic politicians who bent his way in the first weeks and months of his term. yet amid the bursts of resistance is a steady flow of appeasement by some of the countrys most powerful institutions, such as major law firms that have struck deals with the white house including five more last week to collectively provide hundreds of millions of dollars in free legal work. meanwhile, democrats are trying to harness anti-trump energy as the party regroups from 2024 and refocuses on next years midterm elections. but that could get complicated, as some of that anxiety is aimed at democratic leaders. read more from natasha and bridget thats all from the politics desk for now. todays newsletter was compiled by adam wollner. if you have feedback likes or dislikes email us at politicsnewsletternbcuni.com and if youre a fan, please share with everyone and anyone. they can sign up here.

im combative. i wont let myself be eliminated, a visibly infuriated marine le pen said monday evening. in her first interview after an embezzlement conviction that leaves her unable to run for office for five years, the far-right icon conspicuously refused to endorse her lieutenant in the national rally, jordan bardella. that was the first sign of where le pens head is at as she makes an agonizing choice, as my colleagues clea caulcutt and marion solletty lay out let them eat cake after painstakingly transforming her fathers racist party into an electable force, le pen was a strong contender to win the french presidency in 2027. so she could boost bardella to take the top spot on the ticket. après marine, le déluge? or she could dig her heels in and unleash an almighty blitzkrieg, castigating the french justice system with one hand and bringing down the government with the other. both options come with risks. bardella is still seen as green profile here. and so far, the french public seem pretty comfortable with mondays court ruling. an odoxa poll for le figaro published monday evening found that 54 percent of 995 respondents said they believed her sentence was a sign that france had a healthy democracy. another 65 percent said they were satisfied or indifferent to the verdict, victor goury-laffont reports. liberal unease yet even among liberal democrats, there was a sense of unease. sure, this is an affirmation of the rule of law le pen was convicted of misusing european parliament funds for campaign activities, after all. but its not a popular rejection by the demo. germanys spending push drives up borrowing costs across eurozone financial times welcome to britain, where critical whatsapp messages are a police matter reclaim the net the rise of the gurus sam freedman rachel reeves is a helpless pawn in donald trumps tariff war telegraph israel v. the resistance netanyahu cancels appointment of new shin bet head amid opposition from allies times of israel the first responders massacre 14 aid workers found dead and buried, hands bound mondoweiss guurst us blames hamas for israeli execution of palestinian medics antiwar.com kevin w. lordie. three killed in israeli strike targeting hezbollah militant in beirut arab news iran will target britains chagos base if trump attacks telegraph. the media and some readers argued that iran might not be able to reach diego garcia. iran is signaling otherwise. racist allied underestimation of russias abilities led to its win moon of alabama kevin w trump-putin parley is a bit under the weather indian punchline kevin w europe prepares itself for all-out war with russia ian proud germany decides to leave history in the past and prepare for war bbc trumps negotiators fail to understand russia and europe crashes and burns larry johnson big brother is watching you watch open source genetic database shuts down to protect users from authoritarian governments 404media. help me. the fact that police are the main users is a surprise?

  Content: in a normal nation governed by the rule of law not donald trumps america, that is the governments mistaken deportation of a maryland father to a salvadoran gulag, in violation of a federal immigration judges 2019 order, might have been easily resolved. lo! just four days after the supreme court last thursday unanimously ordered the government to facilitate kilmar abrego garcias release back to the united states, el salvadors president nayib bukele was due in the oval office. bukele could have simply given the sheet-metal worker a lift back home to his wife and three children, all u.s. citizens, as part of the salvadoran entourage. for the record an earlier version of this article said president trump repeated his wishes to send citizen criminals to foreign prisons on fox news. it was during a fox noticias interview. thats not what happened on monday, of course. the casually clad bukele, self-described worlds coolest dictator, instead arrived with just the miami club promoters clothes on his back, as jon stewart quipped . then we saw the sorry spectacle of two strongmen presidents, trump and bukele, side by side in the oval office declaring themselves powerless to restore abrego garcias freedom. they smiled smugly, both in on the joke. besides, they claimed without evidence, hes a terrorist. voices calmes what hannah arendt saw in hitlers germany, we can see in trumps america political theorist hannah arendt came of age in germany as hitler came to power. her life and writings have a chilling resonance for americans today. in truth, abrego garcia and hundreds of other men were sent to el salvadors own hotel california, the terrorism confinement center, without due process charges, hearings, evidence, juries or judges. the administration called them the worst of the worst, though several media investigations found that few of the deportees, including abrego garcia, had criminal records other than immigration law infractions, and fewer yet had ties to gangs that trump has designated as terrorist groups. abrego garcias case is especially egregious. team trump admitted in court that he shouldnt have been shipped to el salvador, the one country that the federal order in 2019 said he must not be sent to, given the clear probability of future persecution. in fact , that federal immigration judge found, abrego garcia and his family were gang victims, repeatedly extorted under threat of death in el salvador. the first trump administration didnt appeal that 2019 order, just as the second hasnt. no wonder then that another judge, u.s. dist. court judge paula xinis, ordered the government to report daily on abrego garcias well-being and its attempts to return him, so far to no avail. nothing has been done. nothing, she protested tuesday, before ordering an extraordinary two-week inquiry into the administrations stunning defiance. meanwhile, the administration said in a court filing that if somehow abrego garcia did return, it would detain and deport him again. voices calmes making america a colonizer again the trump administration is trying to force a deal on ukraine and president volodymyr zelensky that would make the imperialists of the past blush. as bad as all this is, the trump-bukele bro-fest in the oval office all but confirmed that there is worse to come. the two men joked joked first in private we know thanks to bukeles post of the video and then openly to reporters that el salvador should build more megaprisons to house undesirable u.s. citizens homegrowns, trump said a couple of times, so pleased by his branding. you gotta build about five more places, he told bukele, yeah, the next phase, bukele agreed. aides cracked up. despite the yucks, trump was serious hes said before that hed love to ship citizen criminals to foreign jails. and he repeated his wishes on tuesday on fox noticias. such citizen deportations would violate another supreme court decision , from 1936, not to mention basic expectations of american justice. trump is halfway to making america a police state was the headline in the financial times the next morning. the only debatable word there is halfway. of the other two supposedly co-equal branches of government, trump has cowed congress and now is openly defying federal courts, including the supreme one. this is confirmation of a constitutional crisis , the likes of which the nation has never seen, except in other lands . more evidence on wednesday, another federal district judge, james e. boasberg, ruled that probable cause exists to find the government in criminal contempt for its willful disregard of his march order that it return the planes ferrying migrants to el salvador. voices calmes the united states careens toward a constitutional crisis what should the american people believe - trumps denials that hes defying court orders or the evidence that can be seen and heard? mondays performance in the oval office was the most chilling since trump and vice president jd vance ganged up on ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky on feb. 28. and now the offices garish new bling all the gold ornaments, wall medallions, cherubs, frames and end tables is a metaphor for trumps desecration of that sanctum. trumps amen choir of aides, including atty. gen. pam bondi and secretary of state marco rubio , piled on with further lies about abrego garcia. for instance the whopper from the execrable stephen miller, white house deputy chief of staff, that the supreme court had ruled 9-to-0 in the administrations favor, which conservative legal authority ed whelan quickly lambasted on x as an outrageous misrepresentation. talk about gaslighting. the supreme court said this about the lower federal courts order to return abrego garcia it properly requires the government to facilitate abrego garcias release from custody in el salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to el salvador. that seems clear enough to just about anyone not on trumps payroll, however cautiously worded the justices two-page order was. and yet, with trump dug in and seemingly enjoying the controversy the better to distract from his calamitous trade war it is hard to see how abrego garcia will be returned anytime soon. supreme court expert and pundit jeffrey toobin was blunt i dont think hes coming back, basically ever, he said on cnn . democrats, laser-focused on criticizing trump about the economy and skittish about immigration issues where he enjoys more support, are finally rousing to the constitutional crisis. maryland sen. chris van hollen landed in el salvador on wednesday, and others, including rep. robert garcia of long beach, also plan trips. but the ultimate pressure must come from the voters, like those who assailed republican sen. chuck grassley at a town hall in iowa this week. when grassley insisted he wouldnt help abrego garcia because thats not a power of congress, the attendees guffawed. they know better. jackiekcalmes

  Title: Senior Trump officials give conflicting lines on tariffs after markets turmoil
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-06 17:37:32)
  Content: senior officials within donald trumps administration officials gave conflicting messages on sunday about the us presidents global tariffs that have caused a meltdown in stock markets, prompted warnings of a world recession and provoked rare expressions of dissent from within his republican party. cabinet members fanned out across sundays political talk shows armed with talking points on trumps 10 across-the-board tariff on almost all us imports, with higher rates targeted at about 60 countries. if the intention was to calm nerves with a clear statement of intent, then it backfired as top officials gave starkly contrasting signals. howard lutnick, the billionaire commerce secretary, struck an aggressive note on cbs newss face the nation in which he portrayed the tariffs as here to stay. asked whether there was a chance that tariffs would be postponed to allow countries to negotiate a deal with washington, he replied there is no postponing they are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks, that is sort of obvious. lutnick added that trump intended to reset global trade. the president has made it crystal, crystal clear, he said. however, two other cabinet members gave the opposite take, suggesting that negotiations with individual countries were very much on the cards. scott bessent, the treasury secretary, told meet the press on nbc news that trump had created maximum leverage for himself, and more than 50 countries have approached the administration about lowering their non-tariff trade barriers, lowering their tariffs, stopping currency manipulation. the agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, echoed bessent by flagging up possible talks. weve got 50 countries that are burning the phone lines into the white house, she told cnns state of the union. the scale of trumps tariffs have sent shockwaves around the world, catching us investors as well as top republican politicians by surprise. in just two days last week, more than 6tn was wiped off wall streets market value. trump told us consumers in a post on his truth social network to hang tough, it wont be easy, but the end result will be historic. yet as he spent the weekend golfing at his mar-a-lago resort in florida, his unprecedented tax increase goaded senior republicans to speak out, in a vanishingly rare display of criticism of their leader. trumps former vice-president, mike pence, denounced the tariffs as the largest peacetime tax hike in us history. thom tillis, the republican senator from north carolina, said anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right needs to talk to farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy. ted cruz, a senator from texas, warned of a bloodbath for republicans in the 2026 midterm elections should the tariffs force the us into recession. democrats are detecting opportunity in such unusual challenges to trump from within his own party. adam schiff, the democratic senator from california, floated on meet the press what sounded like a draft campaign strategy for the midterms. if we head into a recession, it will be the trump recession, he said. of trump, schiff also said hes wrecking our economy. tim walz, the governor of minnesota who ran as the democrats vice-presidential candidate in last novembers defeat to trump, called the tariffs really, really terrifying on state of the union. he warned that if you punish dependable trading partners like mexico and canada, they dont come back overnight. as the tariffs kick in, analysts are increasingly pointing to the chances of a recession, which is normally assessed as being two consecutive quarters of falling gdp. the head of economic research at jp morgan, bruce kasman, has raised the probability of global recession to 60, a figure that he included in a memo titled there will be blood. larry summers, the us treasury secretary during bill clintons presidency, called the tariffs the biggest self-inflicted wound weve put on our economy in history. speaking on abc newss this week, he gave his own estimate of the total loss to us consumers at 30tn equivalent to doubling petrol prices at the pump. skip past

attempted to use rhetorical devices as a way of assuaging rattled investors and consumers. rollins said the markets werent crashing they were adjusting. asked what he would say to americans close to retirement who had just watched their lifetime savings drop significantly in recent days, bessent called that a false narrative. americans who want to retire right now, they dont look at the day-to-day fluctuations of whats happening, bessent said. bessents answer was coloured, perhaps, by his own net worth, which has been put at more than 521m. there were moments of the surreal in the exchanges between trumps top officials and the political show hosts. asked by cnns jake tapper why 10 tariffs had been placed on heard island and mcdonald islands, which are populated by penguins near antarctica but no humans, rollins said i mean, come on, whatever. listen, the people that are leading this are serious, intentional, patriotic the smartest people ive ever worked with. tapper then pushed back on the agriculture secretarys justification for the 20 reciprocal tariffs that have been imposed on eu goods sold to the us. rollins said that honduras bought more pork from the us than the entire european union. tapper pointed out that the eu had tight restrictions on hormone use in livestock production. the eu banned use of synthetic hormones in 1981, and blocked imports of animals that had been treated in that way. rollins then accused the eu of using fake science to prohibit us products. thats just absolute bull, she said. we produce the safest, the most secure, the best food in the world.

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
