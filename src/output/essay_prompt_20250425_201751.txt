  Title: Karen Read's second murder trial revives debate over who killed her Boston police officer boyfriend
  Source: abcnews.go.com (2025-04-22 00:14:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article highlights the prosecution's focus on 'drinking, driving, deadly consequences,' echoing a common public safety narrative. This suggests an attempt to frame the case in a way that resonates with pre-existing public concerns, potentially influencing jury perception and minimizing focus on the defense's conspiracy claims.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the defense was prevented from implicating Colin Albert in their opening statements. This is intriguing because it suggests a limitation on the defense's ability to present their full case. What is the justification for this limitation, and how might it impact the jury's perception of the defense's claims?

  Title: Reams of documents related to L.A. County sex abuse cases never turned over, lawyers say
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:11:23)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article illustrates aspects of the Principal-Agent Problem within the context of public institutions. The county (the principal, representing the public interest) delegates authority to its probation staff (the agents). The text highlights alleged failures of the agents (abuse) and a potential failure of the principal (the county) to adequately oversee, document, and respond to these actions over decades, as evidenced by the discovery dispute and the large settlement payout. This suggests a breakdown in the mechanisms designed to ensure agents act in the best interest of the principal and those they serve.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative around AB 218 and subsequent legislative proposals (like SB 577) reflects elements of Agenda-Setting Theory. The large volume of lawsuits enabled by AB 218 (an event/policy) has forced the issue of institutional liability and financial burden onto the legislative agenda, prompting lawmakers to propose new bills aimed at managing the fallout. The framing by Senator Laird about 'restoring equilibrium' suggests an attempt to shape the public and legislative perception of the problem and the proposed solution.

  Content: thousands of documents that could contain key details about rampant childhood sexual abuse inside a defunct santa clarita detention camp including so-called grooming drawings were left scattered inside the facility and never turned over to the victims attorneys, according to a firm suing l.a. county over the decades-old incidents. as part of the preparation for a looming june trial, attorneys with law firm manly, stewart finaldi had arranged april 15 to visit camp scott, a shuttered l.a. county probation camp where many of their clients say they were sexually abused as children. inside the facility were reams of records that the county should have turned over to the firm more than a year ago through discovery, said attorney courtney thom, whose firm has about 150 civil cases alleging sexual abuse by county probation staff. you can understand my shock when im walking through where my clients got raped as children, and there are documents everywhere, thom said at a monday superior court hearing in downtown los angeles. thom said she discovered thousands of paper grievances, a locked file cabinet labeled personnel files camps a w, and a drawing she believed was signed by thomas jackson a probation deputy accused by at least 20 women of sexually assaulting them at the camp. the drawing, included in a court filing, was of the name tami in big, block orange letters and appeared to be signed by a jackson. t. attorney james sargent, who is representing the county and accompanied thom for the tour last week, called her claims inflammatory and incorrect. they want to air what they deem as dirty laundry, said sargent, who told l.a. superior court judge lawrence riff that the personnel files they discovered had nothing to do with the staff named in the lawsuits. nor did the drawing, he said. tami wilson, a former supervisor at the camp, told him she recalled being given the hand-drawn card by a youth, he wrote in a court filing. the county announced earlier this month they planned to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of alleged sexual abuse inside the countys juvenile facilities and foster homes. the settlement believed to be the largest sex abuse settlement in u.s. history arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to file civil suits against alleged predators and the agencies that employed them. a handful of prominent firms including manly, stewart finaldi declined to participate in the settlement and have ongoing litigation. in the aftermath of ab 218, state legislators have introduced several bills to attempt to make it easier for governments and school districts to deal with the financial fallout from the deluge of suits. one of these bills sb 577 is set for a hearing tuesday. the bills author, state sen. john laird, said the legislation is intended to restore some equilibrium, lessening the financial blow to public agencies while still upholding a victims right to sue. county lawyers claim one reason the state law change has had such a devastating financial toll is because many of the records they need to fight decades-old cases are long gone. attorney john manly argued the claim flew in the face of what his firm saw at camp scott. the county has been telling all of sacramento that they dont have any documents, said manly, who urged the judge to allow his firm to publicize the footage theyd taken of the heaps of documents. we need to be able to share this with legislators. riff agreed with the countys request that the videos from inside camp scott remain confidential for now due to security risks, though he instructed both sides to try to find some common ground on whether certain videos could be made public. though camp scott hasnt been used to house youths for years, sargent wrote in a filing that may soon change. l.a. county superior court judge miguel espinoza ordered the county friday to prepare to shut down los padrinos juvenile hall the countys last remaining juvenile hall, where roughly 270 youths are held due to problems stemming from chronic understaffing. the youth presently in los padrinos will need to go somewhere, and if some wind up at camp scott, the public release of photos and videos could be seriously detrimental, sargent wrote. thom noted that both reporters and television crews have been allowed to broadcast footage taken inside the camp, including a 2001 documentary, camp scott lock-up. the l.a. times has been in there to photograph, said thom. mtv videoed more than we did.

  Title: Coca-Cola under fire after bombshell report exposes ties to controversial industry: 'The cost is irreversible damage to our children's health'
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-22 11:30:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying the concept of Externalities, the article highlights how the social costs of fracking and plastic production (environmental damage, health issues) are not fully borne by the companies involved (Coca-Cola, Unilever, etc.). The text states, 'the fracking process creates environmental damage and can significantly impact local communities' and mentions 'irreversible damage to our childrens health'. This suggests a market failure where the price of plastic does not reflect its true cost to society, leading to overproduction and consumption.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Coca-Cola's 'World Without Waste' initiative but then states 'its link to fracking operations suggests it is still looking to create new plastics.' This juxtaposition creates a contradiction. What are the specific mechanisms preventing Coca-Cola from fully transitioning to recycled plastics, and could these mechanisms be related to the profitability of fracking-derived plastics?

  Title: Bank of England rate-setter says US tariffs likely to push down on inflation
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 11:13:59)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article touches upon aspects of Realism in international relations, specifically concerning trade and tariffs. The US imposing tariffs on the UK, as mentioned in the text ('the us has imposed a 10 import tariff on goods coming from the uk, a policy which also applies to many other countries'), exemplifies a state acting in its perceived self-interest to protect its economy, regardless of the impact on other nations. This action, and the UK's subsequent economic considerations, reflect the competitive and often conflictual nature of international trade relations as described by Realist theory.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents Megan Greene's analysis of potential disinflationary effects of US tariffs on the UK, but also acknowledges 'a tonne of uncertainty around this.' This uncertainty, coupled with the mention of 'both inflationary and disinflationary forces,' suggests a more complex and potentially volatile economic situation than a simple cause-and-effect narrative. What specific factors contribute most to this uncertainty, and how might they interact to produce unexpected economic outcomes?; Intriguing_angles: The opening section discusses the importance of 'parsing out the facts from the messaging' in the context of US politics, while the latter part focuses on economic analysis of UK inflation. This juxtaposition, while seemingly unrelated, could subtly imply that economic narratives are also subject to manipulation or biased framing. To what extent might political messaging influence the interpretation and presentation of economic data, and what mechanisms might facilitate such influence?

  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:22:18)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article focuses heavily on domoic acid poisoning and its effects on marine life, potentially influencing public perception of environmental threats. The repeated mentions of "domoic acid" and its impact on "marine mammals" serve to highlight this specific issue, potentially overshadowing other environmental concerns. This could lead to increased public attention and policy focus on algal blooms and their toxins, while other ecological problems receive less attention.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions "runoff from the recent fires in palisades as contributors to the algae bloom" but doesn't elaborate on the specific mechanisms or the relative contribution compared to other factors like climate change or upwelling. This omission is intriguing because it could downplay the role of human activities (e.g., land management practices that exacerbate fire risk) in contributing to the algal bloom.

  Content: a minke whale that was swimming in long beach harbor earlier this month died from domoic acid poisoning associated with a toxic algal bloom that has stricken many other sea creatures, according to officials. michael milstein, spokesperson for the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations west coast regional office, said test results showed the whale had high levels of domoic acid in its urine at the time of its death. this is consistent with the many other marine mammals we have seen affected by domoic acid produced by the harmful algal bloom off southern california first detected in february, milstein said in a statement. the tests are taking longer since the lab is processing so many. domoic acid is a neurotoxin produced by harmful algal blooms that accumulates in filter-feeding fish including anchovies and sardines which are then eaten by seals, sea lions and dolphins. this is the fourth consecutive year there has been a domoic acid event, but this years started much earlier than previous ones, according to milstein. the algae bloom was the result of an upswell in the ocean that brought up enough nutrients to the surface to allow the algae to thrive, he said. other experts also point to climate change and the runoff from the recent fires in palisades as contributors to the algae bloom. hundreds of sea lions and dolphins have been affected so far, milstein said. this has probably been the most severe, particularly this early in the year, he said. how long it continues is the question. the 24-foot-long minke whale was swimming in the harbor for several days and officials had tried to push it out to sea, only for it to come back, milstein said. the whale, which is male, was then found dead april 3. minke whales are considered the smallest of the great, or baleen, whale family, and can grow to more than 26 feet long and weigh as much as 14,000 pounds, according to noaa . there are about 900 minke whales off the coasts of oregon, washington and california. theyre protected under the marine mammal protection act. last week, a dead gray whale was also found washed ashore on huntington beach. the pacific marine mammal center in laguna beach is performing a necropsy to determine the animals cause of death. although most of the marine mammals affected by domoic acid toxicity are california sea lions, other animals are also susceptible to its effects, according to the marine mammal center. domoic acid has been found in blue and humpback whales, as well as guadalupe fur seals, which is a threatened species. ingesting domoic acid from harmful algal blooms can cause sea lions and other animals to have seizures or to crane their heads in a motion known as stargazing. they can also fall into a comatose state. experts advise people not to interact with animals believed to be sick because they might aggressively lunge or even bite. milstein said its unlikely that the domoic acid event will have a significant effect on the overall population of marine mammals off the western coast. theres a silver lining to the incredible productivity of the california ecosystem, he said. on one hand it is feeding the algae bloom, but its also responsible for the incredible diversity of species were fortunate to have off the west coast. these species are pretty strong and resilient and they have shown that over the year.

  Title: Conservative Group Tries to Stop in Court...
  Source: www.vox.com (2025-04-04 20:58:36)
  Content: at least some gop legal elites are lining up against trumps trade policy. that could be enough to sway the justices. on thursday, one day after president donald trump announced sweeping new tariffs, what appears to be the first lawsuit challenging those tariffs was filed in a federal court in florida. that alone isnt particularly surprising. the tariffs are expected to drive up the costs of goods in the united states, and have already sent the stock market into a nose dive. that means that a lot of aggrieved potential plaintiffs have standing to challenge the tariffs in court. what is surprising is that the plaintiff in this particular case, known as emily ley paper v. trump, is represented by the new civil liberties alliance ncla, a right-wing legal shop that previously backed trumps efforts to expand executive power. get the latest developments on the us supreme court from senior correspondent ian millhiser. ncla is part of what appears to be a growing effort among prominent right-leaning intellectuals and commentators to challenge trumps tariffs. at the volokh conspiracy, an influential right-libertarian legal blog, george mason law professor ilya somin is actively recruiting plaintiffs to file a similar lawsuit challenging the tariffs somin has long been a principled libertarian critic of trump. ben shapiro, the one-time breitbart writer who is also a lawyer, criticized trumps tariffs as a massive tax increase on american consumers, and has gently advocated for trump to change course. richard hanania, a writer best known for his baroque criticisms of wokeness, responded to a pro-trump member of congress praise of the tariffs with were ruled by morons. all of this matters because conservative-minded judges, including the six republicans who dominate the supreme court, are often highly responsive to public statements from conservative legal and media elites. during president barack obamas first term, for example, liberal lawyers and legal scholars were often flabbergasted by how quickly conservative judges rallied behind a weak legal case against the affordable care act eventually persuading four republican justices to vote to repeal the law altogether. their mistake one i made as well was assuming that judges would be persuaded by the kind of careful, precedent-focused legal reasoning that earns you top grades in law school, rather than by what they were hearing from legal and political elites that they viewed as ideological allies. as yale law professor jack balkin wrote about that error, a legal argument can move from off the wall to on the wall because people and institutions are willing to put their reputations on the line and state that an argument formerly thought beyond the pale is not crazy at all. in the end, many judges cared more about what they heard on fox news or at an event hosted by the federalist society, than they did about what the supreme court said in gonzales v. raich 2005. at least on the surface, anyone who wants to challenge trumps tariffs faces a far more favorable legal landscape than obamacare opponents faced in 2010. during the obama and biden administrations, republican justices fabricated novel new legal doctrines, such as the so-called major questions doctrine, in order to strike down democratic policies they deemed too ambitious. they also threatened to revive old, once-discredited ideas like the nondelegation doctrine, which was used to frustrate president franklin d. roosevelts new deal. both of these doctrines are grounded in the idea that the judiciary has broad power to strike down policies established by the executive branch of the federal government, even if the executive can point to an act of congress that explicitly gives them the power to do what they want to do. the primary reason to be skeptical that the supreme court will actually apply one of these doctrines to strike down trumps tariffs is that the republican justices rollout of their new approach to executive power has been so partisan that it is hard not to suspect that they are acting in bad faith. the same six republican justices who said that democratic president joe bidens student loan forgiveness program was an egregious power grab, despite the fact that that program was authorized by a federal statute empowering the executive to waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs, also said that republican president donald trump is allowed to use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes. similarly, the best legal argument against trumps tariffs is rooted in the courts major questions doctrine, which holds that judges should cast a skeptical eye on executive branch actions of vast economic and political significance according to the budget lab at yale, the tariffs are expected to reduce the average american households real annual income by nearly 3,800. that seems like a matter of vast economic and political significance. but the short history of this major questions doctrine would give any serious legal scholar great pause. the idea that programs of vast economic and political significance are suspect was first articulated in utility air regulatory group v. epa 2014, in order to criticize a hypothetical environmental protection agency regulation that was never enacted, that no one ever proposed, and that likely would have shut down all construction of hotels in the united states if it had ever actually existed. a year later, the court used the major questions doctrine again to repudiate an imaginary health regulation that would have collapsed the individual health insurance markets in most states. having used these strawmen to invent a completely new legal doctrine that appears nowhere in the constitution or in any statute, the court let this major questions doctrine lay dormant for trumps entire first term only to revive it with a vengeance once a democrat became president. to date, the doctrine has only been used to strike down actual, rather than theoretical, policies during the biden administration. one of the most important questions looming over trumps second term is whether a republican supreme court will apply the same rules it invented to thwart democratic administrations to trump and his subordinates. we do not know yet how the justices will answer this question. but, as balkin writes, the answer is likely to be shaped by how elite conservatives in the legal profession, the media, and in elected office urge the justices to behave. one of the most important questions is whether elected republicans join groups like ncla or commentators like shapiro in criticizing the tariffs. what really accelerates the movement of constitutional arguments from off the wall to on the wall is neither intellectuals nor social movements, balkin wrote about the obamacare fight. instead, the most important factor is often what republicans in political office want the courts to do. when establishment politicians who, after all, have to stand for election and dont want to be thought out-of-touch to their constituents get behind a constitutional argument, they often help move it forward quickly, balkin wrote. for now, it remains to be seen whether members of congress, governors, and other top elected republicans will speak out against the tariffs once their constituents start to experience the pain of higher prices. but if you are hoping to see these tariffs go away, you should take the fact that the first spear targeting the tariffs was thrown by a prominent right-wing legal shop as a very positive sign. understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news

Historical Article 2 (ID: 124381):
  Title: Karen Read is back on trial for murder. Here’s what to know.
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-01 10:00:00)
  Content: a bitterly contested murder case is returning to court in massachusetts, reigniting a legal battle that has captivated true crime enthusiasts and placed a small-town police force under a microscope. karen read, 45, is set to stand trial again on charges that she struck and killed her boyfriend, boston police officer john okeefe, with her suv after a night of drinking on jan. 29, 2022. her first trial ended in a deadlocked jury last summer. the retrial is set to begin april 1 with jury selection. what happened the night of okeefes death? okeefe and read, a former equity analyst and adjunct professor at bentley college, had been drinking at various bars on the night of jan. 28, 2022, according to court records. just after midnight, read dropped off okeefe at a party in the canton, massachusetts, home of brian albert, another boston police officer. okeefe, 46, was found unresponsive outside alberts house by read at about 6 a.m. jan. 29 and later pronounced dead at a hospital. an autopsy determined he had died of a combination of hypothermia and blunt force trauma. prosecutors alleged that read, his girlfriend of two years, struck him with her suv while turning around after dropping him off. during the trial, they pointed to first responders called to the scene who claimed they heard her yell, i hit him. i hit him. oh my god. i hit him, as well as angry messages she allegedly sent okeefe before his death and vehicle data from the suv. the defense argued that okeefe was assaulted during a party inside alberts house and was left outside in a snowstorm with his injuries staged to suggest he was struck by a car. they said authorities failed to search the house for evidence of a struggle and highlighted potential conflicts of interest between investigators and other members and associates of law enforcement who were at the party that night. prosecutors rejected their claims. what happened during the first trial? read was charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating under the influence of alcohol, and leaving the scene of personal injury and death. more than 70 witnesses testified during the nine-week trial and jurors sifted through more than 600 pieces of evidence only to remain deadlocked, leading judge beverly cannone to declare a mistrial on july 1. two expert witnesses, brought in by the u.s. department of justice to review law enforcements handling of the case, testified that okeefes injuries and the physical evidence did not align with the prosecutions theory that reads suv struck him. the lead investigator, massachusetts state police trooper michael proctor, admitted on the witness stand to sending texts in which he mocked reads health condition, used crude insults to describe her and joked with colleagues about searching her phone for nude photos. in one message, he wrote that he wished she would kill herself. proctor said his comments had zero impact on the investigation. after the mistrial, massachusetts state police removed him from the detective unit. on march 19, the massachusetts state police trial board voted to dishonorably discharge proctor. he was found guilty of three charges of unsatisfactory performance and one charge of consuming alcohol while on duty. the family of okeefe filed a wrongful-death lawsuit last august against karen read as well as two canton bars the couple visited the night he died. a judge ordered a stay in the case to allow reads second criminal trial to proceed. what is expected to happen at the retrial? the theories put forward by the prosecution and defense dont normally change much after a mistrial but strategies do, according to michael cassidy, a criminal law professor at boston college law school and a former state and local prosecutor in massachusetts. cassidy said he expects prosecutors to pare down their case and call fewer witnesses. the defense will probably try to signal as strongly as possible to jurors that there was a previous trial jurors are not told they are at a retrial. the jurys awareness theres a retrial can help the defense, cassidy said they might think, someone else had reasonable doubt about this case, why shouldnt i? prosecutors might leverage the extensive media participation by read and other witnesses to their advantage, which gives prosecutors a broader pool of statements to draw from in an effort to catch inconsistencies in a sworn testimony. the more time a defendant talks to the media, that gives the prosecutors more instances to trip her up, cassidy said. cassidy said jury makeup will be a key change to watch. he suggested the defense will pursue younger jurors or those more open to ideas about conspiracies or government corruption, while prosecutors might want older, more conservative jurors who disapprove of reads alleged heavy drinking and fighting with her partner. how has the case captivated the public? true-crime fans, conspiracy theorists and cable news watchers were drawn to the case, thanks to the swirling narratives of a telegenic female murder suspect, a rocky romance and an alleged cover-up. the first trial was marked by dueling groups of demonstrators outside the courthouse. supporters of read gathered in pink shirts and held signs reading free karen read. groups of detractors held justice for john placards and chanted i hit him! i hit him! in reference to what read allegedly said after finding okeefes body.

  Content: this is an edition of the atlantic daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. sign up for it here. late last month, jonathan braun was arrested on allegations of shoving a 3-year-old, causing a red mark on his back and substantial pain. this is only his latest brush with the law over the past four years. he was banned by federal and new york state judges from working in debt collection fined 20 million and accused of punching his wife and father-in-law, groping a nanny, and attacking a nurse with an iv-bag holder. he also allegedly threatened a man at his synagogue who asked him to pipe down during services. this crime spree is stunning, but what makes it national news is that it has all happened since 2021, when president donald trump commuted brauns 10-year prison sentence for smuggling marijuana. braun, granted clemency during the last hours of trumps first term as president, is one of many recipients of a trump pardon who has found himself back in trouble with the law. some of them are people convicted of serious offenses on january 6, 2021, and then pardoned at the outset of trumps second term in office. despite trumps depiction of the rioters as peace-loving patriots, more than a few of them have proved to be repeat offenders. braun, who is now back in prison , is not the only first-term recipient of clemency to be rearrested. eli weinstein, a convicted ponzi schemer who received a last-minute 2021 commutation, was convicted on march 31 in a 41 million fraud case. philip esformes, whose sentence for his role in a 1.3 billion medicare fraud was commuted in 2020, was arrested last year on domestic-violence-related charges, but the state dropped them a month later. the rapper kodak black has also been repeatedly arrested since receiving a commutation. but the group of people convicted in connection with january 6 has been particularly likely to have found more trouble. former proud boys leader enrique tarrio, who was sentenced to 22 years for seditious conspiracy and other crimes, was arrested for assault just a month after being pardonedat the capitol, no less. d.c. prosecutors declined to pursue charges. he also tried unsuccessfully to stir up conflict at a conference of trump critics in february. matthew huttle, an indiana man who received a pardon for entering the capitol on january 6, was fatally shot by a deputy on january 27 after reaching for a gun. emily hernandez, a missouri woman, was convicted for causing a fatal drunk-driving crash in 2022 the sentencing came days after her pardon for january 6 offenses. andrew taake of texas was pardoned in january, then arrested in february on an outstanding charge for allegedly sending explicit messages to an undercover cop he believed was an underage girl. its not just that clemency recipients have been accused of crimes since their pardons theyve also tried to use the pardons to get off for other offenses. edward kelley argued that his pardon from trump for january 6 also covered his plot to kill the fbi agents who investigated him a judge disagreed. daniel ball said that charges of illegally possessing a gun should be thrown out because the weapon was discovered in a search related to now-pardoned january 6 charges, and the acting u.s. attorney agreed , but dan wilson, a pardoned capitol rioter who made a similar argument, had less luck with a federal appeals court. other defendants have made similar claims, with varying results . david daniel, who was charged with producing and possessing child pornography, also argued that a search that turned up the material was invalid because of his january 6 pardon, but the u.s. attorney in the case disagreed . daniel has pleaded not guilty to the charges. seeing so many people who received pardons get back in trouble with the law should be deeply embarrassing for trumpthough to be fair, pardoning people for a violent assault on the capitol should have been embarrassing to him as well. he is not the first president to issue clemency for personal reasons, but presidential administrations usually carefully administer commutations and pardons, in part to avoid recidivism. the trump white house, however, has shown little regard for the process. last month, it fired justice department pardon attorney elizabeth oyer after she opposed restoring gun rights for the actor mel gibson, then tried to block her from testifying to congress. trump, the first convicted felon to serve as president, has long claimed that he will restore law and order in america, but his definition is highly selective. some of the presidents commutations and pardons are simply favors granted to people who are well connected, but in the case of the january 6 commutations, he was eager to reward loyalty and to make a political point that he and they had both been subjects of political persecution. this creates a nauseating contrast with statements this week in which administration officials have claimed that kilmar abrego garcia, a maryland resident living under protected legal status who was deported to el salvador, is a terrorist, despite a total lack of evidence and despite the fact that the government has previously acknowledged his deportation was an administrative error . the search for some offense to pin on abrego garcia is also being done to make a political point. if trump is eager to find dangerous criminals, he could do so more easily by looking at his pardon list. related here are four new stories from the atlantic todays news 1. a federal judge found probable cause to hold the trump administration in contempt over its willful disregard of his

  Title: Reams of documents related to L.A. County sex abuse cases never turned over, lawyers say
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:11:23)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article illustrates aspects of the Principal-Agent Problem within the context of public institutions. The county (the principal, representing the public interest) delegates authority to its probation staff (the agents). The text highlights alleged failures of the agents (abuse) and a potential failure of the principal (the county) to adequately oversee, document, and respond to these actions over decades, as evidenced by the discovery dispute and the large settlement payout. This suggests a breakdown in the mechanisms designed to ensure agents act in the best interest of the principal and those they serve.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative around AB 218 and subsequent legislative proposals (like SB 577) reflects elements of Agenda-Setting Theory. The large volume of lawsuits enabled by AB 218 (an event/policy) has forced the issue of institutional liability and financial burden onto the legislative agenda, prompting lawmakers to propose new bills aimed at managing the fallout. The framing by Senator Laird about 'restoring equilibrium' suggests an attempt to shape the public and legislative perception of the problem and the proposed solution.
  Key Entities Mentioned:
    - State Legislators:
      > Snippet: in the aftermath of ab 218, state legislators have introduced several bills to attempt to make it easier for governments and school districts to deal with the financial fallout from the deluge of suits.

  Content: thousands of documents that could contain key details about rampant childhood sexual abuse inside a defunct santa clarita detention camp including so-called grooming drawings were left scattered inside the facility and never turned over to the victims attorneys, according to a firm suing l.a. county over the decades-old incidents. as part of the preparation for a looming june trial, attorneys with law firm manly, stewart finaldi had arranged april 15 to visit camp scott, a shuttered l.a. county probation camp where many of their clients say they were sexually abused as children. inside the facility were reams of records that the county should have turned over to the firm more than a year ago through discovery, said attorney courtney thom, whose firm has about 150 civil cases alleging sexual abuse by county probation staff. you can understand my shock when im walking through where my clients got raped as children, and there are documents everywhere, thom said at a monday superior court hearing in downtown los angeles. thom said she discovered thousands of paper grievances, a locked file cabinet labeled personnel files camps a w, and a drawing she believed was signed by thomas jackson a probation deputy accused by at least 20 women of sexually assaulting them at the camp. the drawing, included in a court filing, was of the name tami in big, block orange letters and appeared to be signed by a jackson. t. attorney james sargent, who is representing the county and accompanied thom for the tour last week, called her claims inflammatory and incorrect. they want to air what they deem as dirty laundry, said sargent, who told l.a. superior court judge lawrence riff that the personnel files they discovered had nothing to do with the staff named in the lawsuits. nor did the drawing, he said. tami wilson, a former supervisor at the camp, told him she recalled being given the hand-drawn card by a youth, he wrote in a court filing. the county announced earlier this month they planned to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of alleged sexual abuse inside the countys juvenile facilities and foster homes. the settlement believed to be the largest sex abuse settlement in u.s. history arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to file civil suits against alleged predators and the agencies that employed them. a handful of prominent firms including manly, stewart finaldi declined to participate in the settlement and have ongoing litigation. in the aftermath of ab 218, state legislators have introduced several bills to attempt to make it easier for governments and school districts to deal with the financial fallout from the deluge of suits. one of these bills sb 577 is set for a hearing tuesday. the bills author, state sen. john laird, said the legislation is intended to restore some equilibrium, lessening the financial blow to public agencies while still upholding a victims right to sue. county lawyers claim one reason the state law change has had such a devastating financial toll is because many of the records they need to fight decades-old cases are long gone. attorney john manly argued the claim flew in the face of what his firm saw at camp scott. the county has been telling all of sacramento that they dont have any documents, said manly, who urged the judge to allow his firm to publicize the footage theyd taken of the heaps of documents. we need to be able to share this with legislators. riff agreed with the countys request that the videos from inside camp scott remain confidential for now due to security risks, though he instructed both sides to try to find some common ground on whether certain videos could be made public. though camp scott hasnt been used to house youths for years, sargent wrote in a filing that may soon change. l.a. county superior court judge miguel espinoza ordered the county friday to prepare to shut down los padrinos juvenile hall the countys last remaining juvenile hall, where roughly 270 youths are held due to problems stemming from chronic understaffing. the youth presently in los padrinos will need to go somewhere, and if some wind up at camp scott, the public release of photos and videos could be seriously detrimental, sargent wrote. thom noted that both reporters and television crews have been allowed to broadcast footage taken inside the camp, including a 2001 documentary, camp scott lock-up. the l.a. times has been in there to photograph, said thom. mtv videoed more than we did.

  Title: Karen Read’s second murder trial revives debate over who killed her Boston police officer boyfriend
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-22 16:36:55)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights the prosecution's focus on 'drinking, driving, deadly consequences,' which, as Michael Coyne states, has been 'drilled into us since middle school.' This suggests an attempt to leverage pre-existing societal narratives to frame the case in a way that resonates with jurors and influences public perception.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the defense is hampered by a pretrial ruling preventing them from implicating Colin Albert in their opening statements. This is intriguing because it suggests a potential bias or constraint on the defense's ability to present a full picture of the events. What other evidence might the defense be prevented from presenting, and how might this affect the jury's perception of the case?
  Key Entities Mentioned:
    - commonwealth:
      > Snippet: the commonwealth will focus on the theme drilled into us since middle school drinking, driving, deadly consequences, michael coyne, the dean of massachusetts school of law at andover, said in an email.
    - alan jackson:
      > Snippet: but defense attorney alan jackson began his opening statement by saying the prosecutions case was based on a brazen and flawed assertion that is untethered to the facts and the evidence.
    - hank brennan:
      > Snippet: brennan told jurors that facts and data will lead them to the truth, and that reads own statements will confirm it.
      > Snippet: brennan began his opening statement tuesday by describing the firefighter who raced to the scene in near-blizzard conditions and found read and two other women surrounding okeefes body on the ground.
      > Snippet: the biggest difference in the current trial is the lead prosecutor, hank brennan.
    - karen read:
      > Snippet: the murderer going to jail and karen being exonerated, that would be justice.
      > Snippet: read, who has been featured in several documentaries about her case, has become a minor celebrity.
      > Snippet: read is accused of striking her boyfriend, john okeefe, with her suv in 2022 and leaving him to die alone in the snow outside of a house party in canton
    - judge beverly cannone:

tuesday, more than three years after the death of her boston police officer boyfriend. read is accused of striking her boyfriend, john okeefe, with her suv in 2022 and leaving him to die alone in the snow outside of a house party in canton, a suburb about 20 miles 32 kilometers south of boston. she has been charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating a vehicle under the influence and leaving the scene. during the first trial last year, prosecutors said read intentionally backed into okeefe after she dropped him off at a house party and returned hours later to find him dead. the defense said that she was a victim of a vast police conspiracy and that okeefe was fatally beaten by another law enforcement officer at the party. a mistrial was declared last year after jurors said they were at an impasse and deliberating further would be futile. the biggest difference in the current trial is the lead prosecutor, hank brennan. brought in as a special prosecutor after the mistrial, the former defense attorney has represented a number of prominent clients, including notorious boston gangster james whitey bulger. brennan began his opening statement tuesday by describing the firefighter who raced to the scene in near-blizzard conditions and found read and two other women surrounding okeefes body on the ground. he stepped out into bedlam, he said. the firefighter then asked read what had happened, he said. youll hear her words, i hit him. i hit him. i hit him, brennan said. she admitted what she had done that night. brennan told jurors that facts and data will lead them to the truth, and that reads own statements will confirm it. but defense attorney alan jackson began his opening statement by saying the prosecutions case was based on a brazen and flawed assertion that is untethered to the facts and the evidence. john okeefe did not die from being hit by a vehicle, he said. the facts will show that. the evidence will show that. the data will show that. the science will show that and the experts will tell you that. many of the factors that made the first trial must-see television will feature in the second. most of the the same witnesses are back as are reads aggressive defense team and dozens of her supporters camped out near the courthouse many carrying free karen read signs and wearing pink. read, who has been featured in several documentaries about her case, has become a minor celebrity. a few dozen of reads supporters, many holding american flags, stood in front of the courthouse tuesday morning before moving a block away to comply with a court-ordered buffer zone. those who were reuniting hugged each other, while others took time to bring newcomers up to speed on the case. im here for justice, said ashlyn wade, a read supporter from canton. the murderer going to jail and karen being exonerated, that would be justice. the prosecution, however, stands to benefit from a pretrial ruling from judge beverly cannone that defense attorneys cant mention potential third-party culprits in their opening statements. they can develop a case against two law enforcement officers but cannot implicate alberts nephew, colin albert, as they did in the first trial. i view it as a blow to the defense strategy but not a knockout punch, daniel medwed, a law professor at northeastern university, said of the ruling. all the defense needs to do is create reasonable doubt about karen reads guilt, and that doesnt require pointing to an alternative perpetrator as a matter of law. legal experts expect prosecutors to focus on reads behavior as they did during the first trial her volatile relationship with okeefe and their night of heavy drinking. they also predict the prosecution will lay out a stronger and more coherent case that read clipped okeefe with the back of her suv and sent him tumbling to the ground using data from her car, video and stronger expert testimony. the commonwealth will focus on the theme drilled into us since middle school drinking, driving, deadly consequences, michael coyne, the dean of massachusetts school of law at andover, said in an email. the defense is expected to offer evidence that what they see as a sloppy police investigation was biased and that law enforcement officers set read up to protect the real killers. they could be helped by an audit of the canton police department released last month that found several mistakes with the investigation but no evidence of a cover-up. one of the key witnesses will be former state trooper michael proctor. he led the investigation but has since been fired after a disciplinary board found that he sent sexist and crude texts about read to his family and colleagues. michael proctor and his dismissal from the force may very well serve as the elephant in the courtroom throughout the proceedings, medwed said.

  Title: California’s economy was already sluggish before Trump’s global tariffs - CalMatters
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 07:01:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article highlights the economic challenges facing California, particularly focusing on the impact of tariffs and internal policies. The text states, "president trumps unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on california families, businesses, and our economy..." and "tariffs could hit southern californias most important economic driver...especially hard." This suggests that the article is attempting to frame tariffs as a primary issue affecting California's economy, potentially influencing public perception and policy priorities.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that "californias economic woes predate trump. much of it was self-inflicted." This statement, while acknowledging external factors like tariffs, subtly shifts blame towards internal policies.

tariffs on imported goods. president trumps unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on california families, businesses, and our economy, driving up prices and threatening jobs, newsom said in a statement. the tariffs could have all of those negative impacts, but californias economy was already sluggish. as gabe petek, the legislatures budget analyst, said in a january response to newsoms state revenue forecast, these gains are not tied to improvements in the states broader economy, which has been lackluster, with elevated unemployment, a stagnant job market outside of government and healthcare, and sluggish consumer spending. california has more than a million unemployed workers and its unemployment rate is tied for second-highest among the states. jobs growth remains concentrated in government and government supported health care and social services while other private industries in total continue to shed jobs, according to the center for jobs and the economy, an arm of the california business roundtable trade group. virtually every major segment of californias economy has been facing stiff headwinds in recent years, but the only one enjoying political notice has been southern californias film industry, which is seeing other states and nations lure production away with lower costs and subsidies. those business decisions have considerable consequences for the industrys thousands of middle-class workers the camera operators, set decorators and lighting technicians who make movies and television happen, the new york times reported. δdocument.getelementbyid ak_js_1 .setattribute value, new date .gettime newsom and the legislature are planning a major increase in state subsidies to keep production in california, but it may be too little and too late. meanwhile, the substantial loss of technology jobs in the bay area so far this year is a huge shock to the bay area economy and labor market, scott anderson, chief economist with bmo capital markets, recently told the east bay times. the technology job loss trend has been in place for some time now, but the deterioration in the first two months of the year is concerning. tariffs could hit southern californias most important economic driver the twin ports of long beach and los angeles and the warehouse complexes in the regions interior especially hard. but this sector was already facing rising costs that undercut its competitiveness. the goods movement alliance, a coalition of business groups, is backing newsoms challenge to tariffs, but also cites the states policies, industrial electricity rates twice the national average and high gasoline and diesel fuel prices as negative factors, as well as new pollution controls on ships and anti-warehousing legislation. californias largest-in-the-nation agricultural industry, including its famous winemaking sector, is also shrinking, largely due to uncertain water supplies, labor shortages and the same high costs for electricity and fuel that the logistics industry faces. the public policy institute of california has estimated that, even in the best-case scenario, some 500,000 acres may need to be fallowed in the san joaquin valley due to restrictions on pumping irrigation water from underground aquifers. finally, even though government has been californias foremost employment driver including government-financed medical services in recent years, it is also facing bleak times. the state budget is mired in what fiscal experts call a structural deficit and virtually every major city, some counties and large school districts are in the same pickle. los angeles and san francisco are particularly plagued after several years of of overspending and their leaders, such as los angeles mayor karen bass, are warning

  Title: Karen Read's second murder trial revives debate over who killed her Boston police officer boyfriend
  Source: abcnews.go.com (2025-04-22 00:14:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article highlights the prosecution's focus on 'drinking, driving, deadly consequences,' echoing a common public safety narrative. This suggests an attempt to frame the case in a way that resonates with pre-existing public concerns, potentially influencing jury perception and minimizing focus on the defense's conspiracy claims.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the defense was prevented from implicating Colin Albert in their opening statements.

  Title: Newsom announces lawsuit against Trump's tariffs as California stands to lose billions
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-16 11:00:55)
  Content: california gov. gavin newsom on wednesday announced a lawsuit contesting president trumps executive authority to enact international tariffs without congressional support, which he likened to the commander in chief taking a wrecking ball to americas global reputation. the legal action argues that the international emergency economic powers act that trump cited to impose tariffs does not grant the president the ability to unilaterally adopt tariffs on goods imported to the u.s. the suit from california is the first challenge from any state against trumps trade policy. no state is poised to lose more than the state of california, newsom said about trumps tariffs. thats why were asserting ourselves on behalf of 40 million americans. the case marks the first time newsom has taken a lead role in any of the now 15 lawsuits that california has filed against the current trump administration, signaling a deviation from his more reserved approach to the president during trumps second term. until now, state atty. gen. rob bonta has acted as the face of californias legal battles against the federal government, while newsom has generally maintained a distance from the back-and-forth court tussles. newsom said he chose to take action after absorbing the effects of the tariffs over the last few weeks. he is betraying the people that supported him, newsom said. donald trump has turned his back on his supporters. under the international emergency economic powers act, trump has implemented 10 baseline tariffs on all imported goods, higher taxes on goods from mexico, canada and china, and specific levies on products and materials such as autos and aluminum. the president threatened and then paused additional tariffs on other nations until this summer. california, which the governors office said engaged in nearly 675 billion in two-way trade last year, stands to lose billions in state revenue under trumps tariff policies if international commerce declines and the stock market tanks. mexico, canada and china represent the states three largest trade partners. the gravity and instability of the situation at hand cannot be overstated, bonta said. the risk to california, to our businesses, our workers, our families, cannot be overstated. newsom showed glimpses wednesday of the democratic firebrand hes known for as he implored republicans in congress to do their jobs. theyre sitting there passively as this guy wrecks the economy of the united states of america, which has dominated the global economy, newsom said. the governors shifts between attacking trump and, at times, staying mum about controversial white house actions show that newsom is trying to find his footing on how to effectively deal with trump in his second term. newsom not only leads a state under constant threat of losing essential federal funding for disaster recovery, education and healthcare, but hes also a national figure in a democratic party that is rekindling its resistance to trump after the november election. although democrats have struggled to articulate a message about what they stand for, trumps tariffs are giving them an unpopular issue to stand against, said mike madrid, a republican political consultant. a politician who is not attacking would be making a very big mistake, madrid said. trump gave them an opening that they did not create themselves. since the wildfires decimated pacific palisades and altadena in january, newsom has tried to pick his battles to avoid jeopardizing his working relationship with trump and endangering federal support needed to rebuild. he repeatedly pointed to the negative effects of the tariffs on the state budget and economy wednesday to explain his reasoning for speaking up. the toxic uncertainty over tariffs, he said, probably will lead to higher unemployment, higher inflation, lower gdp projections and less capital gains revenue for california. the economic fallout could leave the state with a considerable deficit to overcome and limited ability to backfill the losses without making sizable cuts to programs. newsom said his proposed state budget will reflect a downgrade in economic outlook in this state. so the impacts on the budget of the state are already being felt and the full impact has not fully been felt, he said. politics confusion grips big tech over exemptions from trump tariffs american tech firms grappled with more uncertainty monday, left to decipher whether they could rely on a tariff exemption for businesses key to the u.s. economy. californias legal case rests on an argument that the international emergency economic powers act, which specifies the actions the president can take if he declares a national emergency in response to a foreign national security, foreign policy or economic threat, does not give trump the authority to enact tariffs. the reality is the u.s. constitution gives congress the power of the purse, bonta said. its congress responsibility to set and collect taxes, duties and excises, including, yes, tariffs, not the presidents. congress hasnt authorized these tariffs, much less authorized imposing tariffs only to increase them, then pause them, then imminently reinstate them on a whim, causing our nation and the global economy whiplash. trump is attempting to override congress and steamroll the separation of powers. the tariffs appear to be on weak legal ground, given the presidents decision to rely on the international emergency economic powers act, said stratos pahis, associate professor of law and co-director of the block center for the study of international business law at brooklyn law school. pahis said congress has delegated the president the power to raise tariffs in response to unfair trade practices or for national security reasons under a separate law called the trade act, which imposes substantive and procedural constraints, such as generally requiring an investigation to be conducted on a country-by-country or goods-by-goods basis. the trade act does not allow the administration to wake up one day and impose 10 tariffs on every country in the world and on every good that comes in, he said. so thats the trade act, which is the normal grounds for the executive to impose or raise tariffs. of course, the president is not using that. the president is using the international emergency economic powers act, pahis said. the ieepa has never been used to impose tariffs and does not explicitly mention tariffs. pahis said a strong argument against using the law to impose tariffs is that it requires the president to declare a national emergency and the president to find that there are unusual and extraordinary threats to the u.s., to u.s. national security or the economy. and thats where i think the law is most likely to fail because its very hard to understand the threats that the president has identified as unusual or extraordinary, pahis said. he noted that the trade deficits and loss of manufacturing that trump is citing are the consequences of u.s. trade policy that the country has deliberately pursued for 80 years. the complaint asks the u.s. district court for the northern district of california to void trumps tariff orders, according to bontas office. pahis said its possible, but also unprecedented, for trump to rely on the trade act and conduct the required investigation, without turning to congress, to legally impose the 10 across-the-board tariffs if the federal government loses the case. requiring congress to take a vote in washington to adopt tariffs or allow trump to enact tariffs could place republican lawmakers in a vulnerable political position in the midterm elections. a recent poll from cbs news showed that 58 of americans opposed the u.s. tariffs on imported goods. times staff writer kevin rector contributed to this report.

afford it. donald trump is preparing to unveil a raft of new tariffs on wednesday afternoon in what the president has repeatedly billed as liberation day. trump has promised to roll out reciprocal dollar-for-dollar tariffs on nations that levy duties on u.s. goods as part of an aggressive attempt to fulfill his administrations america first agenda and correct years of what he deems unfair trade. international markets wait tentatively as the president is expected to unveil his plans at 4 p.m. wednesday at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden at the moment american markets close. plans remain under wraps with trumps team reportedly weighing options through tuesday. however, white house press secretary karoline leavitt stated that the president had already decided his course of action and that the tariffs would go into effect almost immediately. the only way to avoid the new levies, she said, is to move production to the u.s. it follows the liberal candidate for a critical seat on the wisconsin supreme court, susan crawford, who defeated conservative brad schimel in a race seen as a referendum on trump and his billionaire adviser elon musk. former republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is on board with an effort by democrats in the upper chamber led by senators tim kaine, amy klobuchar, and mark warner to end donald trumps made-up emergency that the president has declared against canada allowing him authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on the u.s.s northern neighbor. trump claims the authority by declaring a national emergency caused by the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migration from canada as well as mexico and china. president trump is saying that there is an emergency with canada. canada is a friend, not an adversary. canada is a sovereign nation, not a 51st state, senator kaine of virginia said on tuesday. this morning, cnns haley talbot reports that the list of republicans who will vote yes on a tariffs resolution up for a vote today at around 7 p.m. has grown to include the former gop leader of the senate. kaine said he approached mcconnell last night and didnt even get to the question before the kentucky senator said im with you. other republicans in support of the move to at least symbolically rebuke the president on his trade policy just a few hours after his liberation day announcement on reciprocal tariffs expected to cover a large swathe of u.s. trading partners include senators susan collins, lisa murkowski, and rand paul. senator thom tillis also told cnn that he doesnt plan on voting for kaines resolution, but has some concerns with the trade policies being discussed, adding, we need to see what comes out tomorrow wednesday and be instructed by that before we take action. earlier, trump wrote in part on truth social mitch mcconnell of kentucky, susan collins of maine, lisa murkowski of alaska, and rand paul, also of kentucky, will hopefully get on the republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize canada for the sale, into our country, of large amounts of fentanyl, by tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy. they are playing with the lives of the american people, and right into the hands of the radical left democrats and drug cartels. the senate bill is just a ploy of the dems to show and expose the weakness of certain republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the house will never approve it and i, as your president, will never sign it. after breaking the record for the longest senate speech in history, cory booker now seems to have broken the internet, with a slew of praise, memes and even tiktok videos commemorating his mammoth achievement. the new jersey democrat took to the senate floor on monday evening, saying he would remain there as long as he was physically able. the speech lasted a whopping 25 hours and 5 minutes. mike bedigan looks at some of the online reactions. it was fitting that cory booker was recounting a story about the late civil rights leader john lewis as he entered the 19th minute and 24th hour of a historic speech to the senate on tuesday evening. in that moment, the first black senator for new jersey broke a record for the longest speech ever made in congress, one that was set 67 years ago by the segregationist democrat strom thurmond, who spoke for a day and a night in opposition to the civil rights act. overcome with emotion, booker looked up to the ceiling and touched his heart as his fellow democrats in the chamber applauded his effort. one of msnbcs morning joe hosts is delighting in the fact that the wisconsin supreme court candidate backed by elon musks lost - even after the tech mogul dumped millions into the race. wisconsin voters elected liberal justice susan crawford to the states supreme court on tuesday, beating brad schimel by more than 200,000 votes in the most expensive judicial election in u.s. history. the vote keeps the high courts 4-3 liberal majority intact. musk repeatedly played up the stakes of the election, claiming it will direct the destiny of humanity and the future of the world is at stake. now, morning joe host joe scarborough is reveling in the massive loss musk suffered. katie hawkinson reports from washington, d.c. the u.s. has sent a three-person team to myanmar to help respond to the 7.7-magnitude earthquake, in a move criticized as weak and irrelevant by a former aid official. much larger russian and chinese teams have already been helping search-and-rescue efforts in the country for days. steffie banatvala reports. a mother and her three children were wrongfully detained by immigration enforcement agents in new york and taken to a detention facility in texas, a nonprofit says as it calls for their release. immigration and customs enforcement officers detained the mother - whose birth country was not disclosed - and her kids, one of whom is in third grade, on march 27 while they were executing an arrest on a farm in sackets harbor, new york, according to the new york immigration coalition. kelly rissman reports. elon musk broke his silence after suffering defeat in the wisconsin supreme court race, which cemented a liberal majority for the next three years. susan crawfords win keeps the court under a 4-3 liberal majority in the face of crucial litigation surrounding abortion access, voting rights and redistricting. like president donald trump, musk chose to focus on the background win of wisconsin voters approving the constitutional amendment to enshrine voter id laws, a vote that was being held at the same time as the supreme court race. this was the most important thing, musk posted on x in response to a post on voter id. madeline sherratt has the full story. kelly loeffler, former georgia senator and now head of the small business administration in the trump administration, hailed donald trumps liberation day as the single greatest salvation, for not just small businesses, but for america, during an appearance on fox business this morning. the president eagerly posted a clip of her conversation with maria bartiromo to his truth social account italys prime minister giorgia meloni and the countrys top business lobby warned on wednesday that impending u.s. tariffs could significantly impact the nations exports and its already struggling economy. it is clear that the introduction of new tariffs would have heavy repercussions for italian producers, meloni said while hosting a prize-giving ceremony for italian cuisine in rome. meloni added that she did not rule out adequate responses to protect the exports of the euro zones third largest economy, though she did not provide further details. italy recorded a trade surplus with the united states of 39 billion euros 42.14 billion in 2024, the third largest in the 20-nation euro area, according to eurostat data. earlier on wednesday, the business association confindustria reported that italys economy is expected to grow by 0.6 this year, half of the governments official target and down from a 0.9 forecast made by the group in october. the economy expanded by a modest 0.7 in both 2024 and 2023. it managed to achieve 0.1 growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the previous three months, after stagnating in the third quarter. most analysts do not foresee any significant rebound in the near term. confindustria indicated that while its forecasts accounted for the already-announced u.s. tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as what it termed record levels of uncertainty regarding trade policy, they did not consider the effects of an escalating trade war. in a worst-case scenario, with permanent 25 u.s. tariffs on all imports, rising to 60 for china, coupled with retaliatory measures against u.s. exports, italys growth could decline to around 0.2 this year, it said. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: In unprecedented payout, L.A. County will settle sex abuse claims for $4 billion
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-04 16:30:44)
  Content: a woman who alleges she was sexually assaulted as a child at the now-closed maclaren childrens center. thousands of former foster children have sued, alleging abuse by staff there. los angeles county plans to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of childhood sexual abuse that allegedly occurred inside its juvenile facilities and foster homes, dwarfing the largest sex abuse settlements in u.s. history. the mammoth settlement, which still needs to be approved by both the county claims board and county supervisors, is a billion dollars more than what county officials had anticipated as the worst-case scenario to resolve a flurry of lawsuits and far more than other organizations notorious for allowing unchecked sex abuse have paid victims. the boy scouts of america, by comparison, agreed to pay 2.46 billion. the archdiocese of los angeles has paid out about 1.5 billion for alleged abuse at the hands of catholic priests. victims of usc gynecologist george tyndall got 1.1 billion. michigan state university paid 500 million to victims of team doctor larry nassar. the unprecedented settlement stems from ab 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to sue, even though the statute of limitations had expired. many california counties, which are responsible for the care of children in foster homes and juvenile halls, saw an uptick in lawsuits. for l.a. county, it was a deluge that still hasnt stopped. thousands of men and women came forward to say they had been molested or raped by probation officials decades ago while incarcerated as children in the countys sprawling network of juvenile halls and camps. thousands more alleged sexual abuse at the now-shuttered maclaren childrens center , a county-run home for foster children that plaintiffs attorneys have compared to a house of horrors. a report found that the facility went decades without doing criminal background checks on its staff. taken together, the thousands of lawsuits, most of which involve alleged abuse from the 1980s through the 2000s, paint a picture of a government that failed to intervene as its facilities turned into hunting grounds for predators, who held immense power over the children in their custody. on behalf of the county, i apologize wholeheartedly to everyone who was harmed by these reprehensible acts, said l.a. county chief executive officer fesia davenport in a statement. she said the county has worked in recent years to crack down on sexual abuse of minors. improvements touted by the county include bolstering the vetting of foster parents and probation staffers and winding down the use of group homes like maclaren childrens center. davenport made headlines in 2023 when she estimated in a public budget hearing that the county could be looking at 1.6 billion to 3 billion in liability for the roughly 3,000 sex abuse claims it expected. her estimate was met with shock and a dash of skepticism from seasoned attorneys suing the county, who said it would blow any previous sex abuse payout out of the water. since then, thousands of additional victims have sued, with more coming forward every month. in addition to creating a three-year window for victims, which closed at the end of 2023 , the new state law let plaintiffs sue if they were under the age of 40 or had recently discovered the abuse they suffered as children. the county said the 4-billion settlement covers most but not all of the childhood sexual abuse lawsuits. some attorneys were not willing to participate in the global mediation process, and negotiations are underway with plaintiffs in those cases, according to the county. the settlement does not include any of the 150 cases filed by manly, stewart finaldi, one of the most high-profile sex-abuse law firms negotiating with the county, according to courtney thom, a partner with the firm. resolving those cases could end up costing the county millions more. patrick mcnicholas, whose law firm is representing 1,200 plaintiffs, said he was mindful during settlement discussions to reach for a number that would bring some justice to the thousands of victims without bankrupting the county, which serves as the regions social safety net. he reasoned that the government could stay solvent with a 4-billion payout and yet it was still the largest sex abuse payout he has ever heard of. this is a historic settlement, he said, noting that he couldnt find a larger sex abuse settlement anywhere in the world. it recognizes the horrific harm that has been done. dominique anderson, pictured around age 11, is one of thousands of plaintiffs who have sued over abuse at the countys juvenile faculties. anderson said her probation officers boss molested her in a motel room when she was around 13. dominique anderson the 4-billion payout will be a huge blow to a county already in tumultuous financial waters, thanks to threats of funding cuts from the trump white house and the cost of recovering from the devastating palisades and eaton wildfires. davenport has warned that the county government , which has a roughly 49-billion budget, could face a fiscal crisis unless hiring is frozen. county officials have said the money will come from draining the countys rainy day fund, slashing department budgets and taking out bonds. the county is expected to owe hundreds of millions of dollars in interest on those bonds, which have to be paid off by 2051. the county said it will pay out the settlement money between january 2026 and jan. 30, 2030, providing the billions to independent allocators who will decide how to divvy it up among the roughly 6,800 plaintiffs. there have been few criminal prosecutions of county staffers accused of abuse in the lawsuits. the probation department presented the l.a. county district attorneys office with evidence against two staff members, thomas jackson and altovise abner, in december 2023. the status of those cases was not immediately available.

      > Snippet: since then, significant progress has been made restoring gulf habitats and ecosystems, according to the natural resource damage assessment trustee council, a group of state and federal agencies tasked with managing restoration funded by penalties levied against bp.
  Content: new orleans ap fifteen years after the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded off the gulf coast, killing 11 and sending 134 million gallons 507.2 million liters of crude gushing into the ocean, the effects of the nations worst offshore oil spill are still being felt. oil company bp paid billions of dollars in damages, propelling ambitious coastal restoration projects across five states. yet cleanup workers and local residents who suffered health impacts they attribute to the oil spill have struggled to have their cases heard in court and few have received significant compensation. conservation groups say the spill catalyzed innovative restoration work across the gulf coast, but are alarmed at the recent halt of a flagship land-creation project in louisiana. as the trump administration expands offshore oil and gas, they are concerned the best opportunities for rebuilding the gulf coast are slipping away. tying health problems to the spill remains hard to prove in court in the coastal community of lafitte in southeast louisiana, tammy gremillion is celebrating easter sunday, the anniversary of the april 20 spill, without her daughter. she remembers warning jennifer against joining a cleanup crew tasked with containing the spill for bp. but i couldnt stop her they were offering these kids lots of money, gremillion said. they didnt know the dangers. they didnt do what they should have to protect these young people. jennifer worked knee-deep in oil for months, returning home reeking of fumes, covered in black splotches and breaking out in rashes and suffering headaches. she also was exposed to corexit, an epa-approved chemical applied on and below the water to disperse oil, which has been linked to health problems. in 2020, jennifer died of leukemia, a blood cancer that can be caused by exposure to oil. gremillion, who broke down in tears as she recounted her daughters death, is 1,000 confident that exposure to toxins during the cleanup caused the cancer. she filed a lawsuit against bp in 2022, although the allegations have been difficult to establish in court. gremillions suit is one of a small number of cases still pending. an investigation by the associated press previously found all but a handful of roughly 4,800 lawsuits seeking compensation for health problems linked to the oil spill have been dismissed and only one has been settled. in a 2012 settlement, bp paid ill workers and coastal residents 67 million, but this amounted to no more than 1,300 each for nearly 80 of those seeking compensation. attorneys from the downs law group, representing gremillion and around 100 others in cases against bp, say the company leveraged procedural technicalities to block victims from getting their day in court. bp declined to comment on pending litigation. in court filings, bp denied allegations that oil exposure caused health problems and attacked the credibility of medical experts brought by plaintiffs. controversy over coastal restoration the environmental impact was devastating, recalled pj hahn, who served on the frontlines as a southeast louisiana coastal management official. he watched the oil eat away at barrier islands and marsh around his community in plaquemines parish until it would just crumble like a cookie in hot coffee, just break apart. oyster beds suffocated, reefs were blanketed in chemicals and the fishing industry tanked. pelicans diving for dead fish emerged from the contaminated waters smeared in a black sheen. tens of thousands of seabirds and sea turtles were killed, according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration. since then, significant progress has been made restoring gulf habitats and ecosystems, according to the natural resource damage assessment trustee council, a group of state and federal agencies tasked with managing restoration funded by penalties levied against bp. the council says more than 300 restoration projects worth 5.38 billion have been approved in the gulf of mexico, which president donald trump renamed the gulf of america. the projects include acquiring wetlands in mississippi to protect nesting areas for birds, rebuilding reefs along pensacola bay in florida and restoring around 4 square miles 11 square kilometers of marsh in lake borgne near new orleans. while a tragedy, the spill galvanized a movement one that continues to push for a healthier, more resilient coast, said simone maloz, campaign director for restore the mississippi river delta, a conservation coalition. the influx of billions of dollars in penalties paid by bp allowed us to think bigger, act faster and rely on science to guide large-scale solutions, she added. yet what many conservationists see as the flagship of the restoration projects funded by the deepwater horizon disaster payout an approximately 3 billion effort to divert sediment from the mississippi river to rebuild 21 square miles 54 square kilometers of land in southeast louisiana has stalled over concerns of its impact on the livelihoods of local communities and dolphin populations. louisiana gov. jeff landry has said the project would break our culture by harming local oyster and shrimp fisheries due to the influx of freshwater. earlier this month, his administration paused the project for 90 days, citing its high costs, and its future remains uncertain. more offshore drilling planned for gulf the trump administration is seeking to sell more offshore oil and gas leases, which the industry trade group american petroleum institute called a big step forward for american energy dominance. bp announced an oil discovery in the gulf last week and plans more than 40 new wells in the next three years. the company told the ap it has improved safety standards and oversight. we remain keenly aware that we must always put safety first, bp said in an emailed statement. we have made many changes so that such an event should never happen again. still, joseph gordon, climate and energy director for the nonprofit oceana, warned deepwater horizons legacy should be an alarm bell against the expansion of offshore drilling. ___ brook is a corps

  Title: Trump’s tariffs may be reduced but their impact will be felt in the UK and beyond
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-10 05:00:21)
  Content: donald trump may have stepped back from his huge tariff rises on every country, except china, which now faces at least 145, but the impact of the market chaos is likely to continue in the uk and beyond. the rest of the world still faces a blanket 10 tariff on all us exports. while much of the focus has been the direct impact of the tariffs on physical goods, trumps actions threaten to reach every corner of global finance and the economy. here, we examine the potential consequences of the tariffs and the fallout, from derailing deals and further undermining londons stock exchange, to risking a rise in corruption and pushing up prices for consumers. falling global growth view image in fullscreen workers make garments for export at a workshop in jiangsu province, china. photograph nurphotogetty the leading economic forecasters have yet to give their verdict, but the international monetary fund has already said the trade war will damage trade and business investment in most countries. china could fail to meet its 5 growth target for 2025, while germany could be pushed into recession. the uk is likely to escape relatively unscathed in terms of trade. uk goods exports to the us are significant, but businesses are expected to minimise the impact of tariffs, leading to a modest 0.1 percentage point reduction in uk gdp this year. however, with borrowing costs still high and consumer confidence at risk, the tariffs present a significant headache for keir starmer. soaring inflation and lower rates central banks have spent much of the past three years attempting to reduce inflation, which reached as high as 11 after russias full-scale invasion of ukraine in 2022. trumps tariffs threaten to send costs for consumers surging. it is why the eu and the uk have proved reluctant to respond in kind to washingtons barrage of tariffs. some estimates say us inflation currently at 2.8 could peak at 4.5 next year if tariffs remain in place and that the chances of a us recession have increased. to tackle this, central banks across the uk and europe are widely expected to cut rates soon to protect their economies. the us federal reserve has not signalled that interest rate cuts are on the way in the us, but it may be forced to if growth slows as anticipated. stock market listing delays view image in fullscreen it may take the china-founded, fast-fashion retailer shein longer to charge ahead with plans for a float on the london stock exchange photograph bloomberggetty the city has been waiting patiently for a market rebound that would help unleash pent-up plans for floats by some of the uks biggest fintech firms, including neobanks such as revolut, monzo and starling. the fintech lobby group innovate finance even convened a unicorn council in 2024 that has been loosely referred to as a group of uk companies seen as ipo candidates. the swedish buy now, pay later giant klarnas 15bn new york float was seen as imminent, with the company widely expected to launch an investor roadshow this week. but as a result of the market turmoil it has failed to announce any further progress. there are also questions about how long it may take for the china-founded, fast-fashion retailer shein to charge ahead with plans for a controversial float on the london stock exchange. shein reportedly filed papers with britains markets regulator in early june last year, though a date for its potential float has yet to be set. the valuation of the float has reportedly been cut from the 64bn-plus it had previously hoped for. meanwhile, the italian fashion group prada has reportedly negotiated a discount of more than 200m 156m on the purchase of versace in light of the trade war, the financial times reported. junk bonds the us investment firm blackrock has given junk bonds a clean bill of health, saying the loans made by companies that use them as a lifeline are not threatened by trumps tariffs. a junk bond is a grade of loan that pays a high interest rate because ratings agencies consider them risky. the two largest department stores in the us, saks and neiman, came together at the end of 2024 in a buyout funded by a 2.2bn junk bond paying 11 interest. there are other retailers in the us that almost exist just to finance their loans. however, choppy markets have left investors considering the implications of high tariff rates on deals in new york, freezing debt refinancing arrangements, bloomberg reported. skip past newsletter promotion sign up to business today free daily newsletter get set for the working day well

fighting renationalisation. photograph neil hallepa the uks biggest water supplier, which is struggling under a debt pile of close to 20bn, has selected the us private equity group kkr as a preferred partner as it seeks to secure fresh equity funding for its operations by the end of june, staving off nationalisation. it is understood the money is already in place. however, kkrs investment committee has a veto and the deal could be scuppered if the tariff war triggers further turmoil on financial markets. that said, kkr was part of a consortium that reached a 1.6bn deal to buy the nhs landlord assura on wednesday. banks preparing for bad debts profits at banks across the world could take a hit, with tariffs affecting business borrowers and large corporate clients that sell products to the us. it could dampen appetite for loans and weigh on demand for investment banking services, which help execute mergers and acquisitions, as well as fundraising through financial markets including ipos. but a drop in revenues could make it harder for companies to repay their debts. that could, in turn, force banks to start putting aside money for potential defaults in their first-quarter results, which are due later this month. natwest privatisation delayed the governments stake in natwest group the bank formerly known as royal bank of scotland has been rapidly dwindling, having fallen to 3.95 at the end of march as the government took advantage of the lenders strong share price. it fuelled speculation that the bank could be weeks away from completely ditching its taxpayer-owned shares. however, market ructions caused by the tariff backlash have likely put a temporary pause on the state sell-down, as the government aims to recoup as much of its cash as possible. the uk government originally spent 46bn bailing out rbs at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, leaving taxpayers owning about 84 of the lender. natwest shares have struggled to return to the 500p paid by the government 17 years ago, but managed to hit 480p in early march. increased corruption mary lovely, a trade expert at the peterson institute in washington, has raised the prospect of widespread fraud at us ports and airports as customs officials wrestle with a complicated tariff regime affecting tens of thousands of imported goods. the situation will get worse for border staff if trump scraps the de-minimis rule that allowed goods valued at less than 800 to enter the us tariff free. there could be huge pressure on customs officials from importers to wave through shipments for a fee to escape high tariffs.

  Content: world war fee president trumps reign of tariffs has been challenged on the left and right by the state of california and the liberty justice center. on april 2, 2025, the white house announced a broad set of tariffs on goods imported into the states, a tax that generally gets passed on to buyers. the rates pdf range from 11 percent, for cameroon and democratic republic of the congo, to 145 percent to 245 percent for china, depending on the type of products at issue. last week, president trump paused his retaliatory levies for three months and offered to lower the numbers, china excepted, amid a stock and bond market meltdown triggered by his global trade war. this week, the tariff situation remains in flux, leaving businesses and folks in a fog of uncertainty and facing recession if not depression. the white house argued the tariffs are necessary to, in part, encourage more manufacturing on american soil and reduce the reliance on foreign factories. the wall street journal called the presidents tariffs the dumbest trade war in history. rob bonta, california attorney general, announced a lawsuit pdf wednesday seeking relief from the presidents allegedly unlawful use of the international emergency economic powers act of 1977 ieepa to justify the imposition of his import taxes. bonta argues the tariffs will wreak havoc on californias economy. the presidents chaotic and haphazard implementation of tariffs is not only deeply troubling, its illegal, said bonta. as the fifth largest economy in the world, california understands global trade policy is not just a game. were standing up for american families who cant afford to let the chaos continue california governor gavin newsom added, president trumps unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on california families, businesses, and our economy driving up prices and threatening jobs. were standing up for american families who cant afford to let the chaos continue. the california office of the attorney general claims the tariffs, at the very least, will shrink the us economy by 100 billion annually and increase inflation by 1.3 percent, at a cost to the average american family of 2,100. the tax foundation, a non-profit think tank, estimated trumps tariffs will reduce long-run us gdp by 0.8 percent before any foreign counter-tariffs are considered. californias lawsuit, filed in a federal district court in the north of the state, argues the ieepa does not give the president the power to impose tariffs. in the nearly 50-year history of ieepa, no president has ever used ieepa to impose tariffs, prior to the unprecedented actions of president trump in 2025, the california complaint reads. ieepa further provides that the president, in every possible instance, shall consult with the congress before exercising any of the authorities granted by this chapter and shall consult regularly with the congress so long as such authorities are exercised. and no such consultation took place, the legal filing insists. the liberty justice center ljc describes itself as a nonprofit, nonpartisan, public-interest litigation firm that seeks to protect economic liberty, private property rights, free speech, and other fundamental rights. source watch calls the ljc as a right-wing organization, citing ties to the conservative illinois policy institute. nonetheless, the ljc makes similar arguments to those raised by californias lawsuit in its complaint pdf against the white houses drive to make americans pay more for their foreign-made stuff, filed with the us court of international trade. the statute the president invokes does not authorize the president to unilaterally issue across-the-board worldwide tariffs the president of the united states claims the authority to unilaterally levy tariffs on goods imported from any and every country in the world, at any rate, calculated via any methodology or mere caprice immediately, with no notice, or public comment, or phase-in, or delay in implementation, despite massive economic impacts that are likely to do severe damage to the global economy, the ljc complaint argues. if actually granted by statute, this power would be an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the executive without any intelligible principle to limit his discretion. but congress has not delegated any such power. the statute the president invokes the international emergency economic powers act ieepa does not authorize the president to unilaterally issue across-the-board worldwide tariffs. the ljc lawsuit has been filed on behalf of five businesses allegedly harmed by the tariffs beverage importer vos selections, e-commerce biz fishusa, plastic pipe maker genova pipe, educational electronics kit maker microkits, and cycling apparel firm terry precision cycling. no one person should have the power to impose taxes that have such vast global economic consequences, said jeffrey schwab, ljc senior counsel, in a statement. the constitution gives the power to set tax rates including tariffs to congress, not the president. both california and the ljc have sought relief from the judicial branch of the us government, which appears to be unable to compel the executive branch to return a man unlawfully deported to el salvador and imprisoned without charge or trial.

  Title: Trump makes sweeping move to undercut state climate laws, including California's
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-09 21:47:16)
  Content: the trump administration this week ramped up its efforts to erode nationwide climate progress with a sweeping executive order aimed at undermining states ability to set their own environmental policies, including key components of californias fight against climate change. in an order dated april 8, the president directed atty. gen. pam bondi to identify and stop the enforcement of state laws that address climate change and other environmental initiatives. many states have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, burdensome and ideologically motivated climate change or energy policies that threaten american energy dominance and our economic and national security, the president wrote in the executive order. these state laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my administrations objective to unleash american energy, he wrote. they should not stand. climate environment how the epas environmental about-face could upend californias climate efforts the agencys plan to repeal or weaken more than two dozen environmental regulations could deliver a direct blow to causes close to the heart of californians including air and water quality standards, electric vehicle initiatives and efforts to curb planet-harming greenhouse gas emissions. the assertion of federal power over states rights seems to go against some of trumps other positions he campaigned, for example, on states rights for issues such as abortion. the order calls out several states specifically, including new york and vermont, which he accuses of extorting fossil-fuel companies for their past contributions to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. the order also takes aim at californias cap-and-trade program a first-of-its-kind initiative that sets limits on companies greenhouse gas emissions and allows them to sell credits for unused emissions to other companies. california, for example, punishes carbon use by adopting impossible caps on the amount of carbon businesses may use, all but forcing businesses to pay large sums to trade carbon credits to meet californias radical requirements, the president wrote. the executive order marks a continuation of trumps recent anti-environmental efforts, which have included cuts to grant funding, widespread office closures and layoffs in the climate research community, loosened regulations and renewed efforts to expand the production of oil and coal two sectors that contribute heavily to global warming. it also marks an escalation of trumps conflict with california. the president in recent months has taken particular aim at the democratic stronghold, including threatening to withhold disaster aid for the states wildfire response and recovery over issues such as forest management and water policies. theres a little bit of beef right now between trump and the state, said maggie coulter, a senior attorney with the climate law institute at the nonprofit center for biological diversity. i think wanting to call out california was part of why cap and trade got mentioned. cap-and-trade isnt the only california program that could be in the federal governments cross-hairs. the order directs bondi to seek out and prioritize state laws that address climate change, environmental justice, greenhouse gas emissions and carbon taxes, which is kind of like a laundry list of all the things the oil-and-gas industry doesnt like, coulter said. to that end, the executive order might also affect californias ability to set strict tailpipe emission standards and its effort to transition to electric vehicles, including a state law banning the sale of new gas-powered cars in 2035. the trump administration has already made moves to block that law, which are now playing out in the courts. the executive order additionally could impact californias polluters pay climate superfund act of 2025, a bill currently working its way through the state legislature that would require fossil fuel companies to pay for damage caused by their greenhouse gas emissions. it is similar to the legislation in new york and vermont that trump called out in his order, coulter said. blocking those laws would be akin to creating immunity for the fossil-fuel industry from those damages, not unlike protections that shield firearms manufacturers from certain civil lawsuits, according to cassidy dipaola, communications director with make polluters pay, a campaign for climate accountability. president trumps executive order weaponizes the justice department against states like california that want to make polluters pay for climate damage, dipaola wrote in a statement. this is the fossil-fuel industrys desperation on full display theyre so afraid of facing evidence of their deception in court that theyve convinced the president to launch a federal assault on state sovereignty. climate environment california lawmakers urge trump to spare states hydrogen energy project a bipartisan group of california lawmakers is calling on the trump administration to preserve federal funding for a hydrogen energy project, saying it is vital for the nations future. indeed, the oil and gas industry celebrated the order issued the same week the president also ordered the immediate expansion of coal production in the country, including opening federal lands to coal leasing and extending the operating life of existing coal plants. we welcome president trumps action to hold states like new york and california accountable for pursuing unconstitutional efforts that illegally penalize u.s. oil and natural gas producers for delivering the energy american consumers rely on every day, read a statement from ryan meyers, senior vice president with the american petroleum institute. california appears poised to push back. in a statement, gov. gavin newsom described trumps order as a glorified press release. this is the world the trump administration wants your kids to live in, newsom said. californias efforts to cut harmful pollution wont be derailed by a glorified press release masquerading as an executive order. the governors office noted that california continues to make progress when it comes to clean energy, including increasing battery storage 1,600 since 2019 and running on 100 clean electricity for the equivalent of 45 days last year. greenhouse gas emissions are down 20 since 2000. the trump administration has stated that its slew of environmental rollbacks are intended to ease regulatory costs, lower taxes and expand the creation of an affordable and reliable domestic energy supply. simply put, americans are better off when the united states is energy dominant, trumps executive order says. the order gives bondi 60 days to compile a list of applicable state climate laws and submit a report to the president regarding actions taken, along with recommendations for additional legislative steps necessary to stop the enforcement of those state laws. coulter, of the climate law institute, said actually preventing states from enforcing their laws would be an illegal and unconstitutional overreach. its not really something that trump or the attorney general can do, coulter said. if you want to stop the enforcement of state law, you have to go to court, and thats the jurisdiction of the court. should the administration actually attempt to stop states from enforcing their own laws, she said, lawsuits and legal challenges are almost certain to ensue.

  Title: Trump announces huge new tariffs to promote US manufacturing, risking inflation and trade wars
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 20:57:51)
  Content: by josh boak associated press washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the new tariffs, coming on what trump has named liberation day, are a bid to boost u.s. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he says are years of unfair trade practices. but by most economists assessments, the move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and upend decades-old alliances. the white house is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble. april 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern american history, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said tuesday. she said the new tariffs would take effect immediately. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. based on the possibility of broad 20 tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. because trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. leavitt is among three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the associated press on first and fifth amendment grounds. the ap says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. the white house says the ap is not following an executive order to refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america. associated press writers mike householder in oldcastle, ontario, sylvie corbet in paris and lisa mascaro contributed to this report.

  Content: by michael every of rabobank i have also to announce to congress that during the night and the early hours of this morning the first of the series of tariffs in force upon the european continent has taken place. in this case the liberating assault fell upon the coast of france. an immense armada of upwards of 4,000 tariffs, together with several thousand smaller tariffs, crossed the channel. massed airborne tariffs have been successfully effected behind the enemy lines, and tariff landings on the beaches are proceeding at various points at the present time. the americans are sustained by about 11,000 first line tariffs, which can be drawn upon as may be needed for the purposes of the battle. i cannot, of course, commit myself to any particular details. reports are coming in in rapid succession. so far, the commanders who are engaged report that everything is proceeding according to plan. and what a plan! this vast operation is undoubtedly the most complicated and difficult that has ever taken place. it involves tides, wind, waves, visibility, both from the air and the sea standpoint, and the combined employment of land, air and sea tariffs in the highest degree of intimacy and in contact with conditions which could not and cannot be fully foreseen. apologies to winston churchill for misusing his d-day speech we shall tariff on the beaches, we shall tariff on the landing grounds, we shall tariff in the fields and in the streets, we shall tariff in the hills we shall never surrender, would have been snappier, but historically, the above is the correct one for today. because its t-day, or liberation day, or make america wealthy again mawa day. thats all we know so far. one rumor is we may get a 20 universal tariff, which would say a lot about state and not so much about craft or a targeted scheme that may or may not then be negotiated down. we all still have to wait and see. of course tomorrow we start 25 us auto tariffs, on which please see our latest report . ahead of that last-second us decision, last-minute countermoves are being made. israel where not much work was needed and vietnam where more was have both cut all their tariffs on us goods in the hope of a better outcome, and india is reportedly considering the same. europe and canada and mexico are instead preparing to fight back, the former even floating escalation into new areas like services and tech that will surely guarantee a furious us response. the wall street journal hopes tariff clarity today will calm markets, and thats the white house view too. however, then we all have to wait and see what happens re counter-tariffs, which seem inevitable -europe is talking in suitably churchillian terms again- and then what the us does in the trade space in response, and outside it to those who dont see trade is now connected to things like us security umbrellas. in short, we need to quote winnie again now this is not the end. it is not even the beginning of the end. but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. yet while d-day was a very brave and uncertain exercise, the underlying dynamic of us and soviet military production vs. german and japanese made the ultimate outcome of ww2 inevitable, just as the ideological split between the us and the soviets would always then split the world in a different way afterwards. you cant focus on just one front, no matter how dramatic, but always need to see the entire theatre of operations. place us tariffs in the context of a grand macro strategy to retain global hegemony as it is now massively outproduced by china, which is allied with russia and iran, and you can again see the risks global bifurcation that makes any one us tariff like a pebble on a normandy beach. economic models that project the rest of the world trading more with each other in the absence of the us market are just that models. the actual world economy will not work like that. as such, if the us goes it alone today, it implies certain uncertainty and if it tries to lever others to join it against china, it implies different but equally certain uncertainty. thats as china just rehearsed encircling and blockading taiwan again with more ships and jets. recall the us department of defence memo leak said this is now its national security focus. europes von der leyen, talking about fighting on the beaches vs the us tariffs, said nothing, but has spoken very bluntly on this in the past but what would the eu do in a worst-case scenario if its also preparing to fight russia and shooting back in a us trade war? on this in the past but what would the eu do in a worst-case scenario if its also preparing to fight russia and shooting back in a us trade war? russia wont accept us peace proposals on ukraine in their current form the us may impose secondary sanctions on buyers of russian oil or even interdict the shadow fleet operating out of the baltic as a response. the us centcom chief was in tel aviv for 10-hour discussions, as the pentagon orders more firepower to the middle east. russia says bombing irans nuclear infrastructure will have repercussions for the entire region. and, depending on what iran might do to others under any attack, not only for that region. us national security advisor waltz, with the signal scandal still swirling round him, is accused of conducting government business over his personal gmail account. is this a shotgun to his own foot, again, or friendly fire? how much longer will waltz be around, and who might replace him if he goes? even the current data are uncertain. after yesterdays us ism data showing weak new orders and employment and a surge in prices paid, the atlanta fed now sees us gdp in q1 at -3.7. its not as bad stripping out recent gold imports, or all the other imports surging into the us to front-run tariffs. but it isnt good. once again, central banks have no idea what to do and are clearly just hoping for the best. the feds goolsbee warned about a slowdown in consumer spending and business investment due to tariff uncertainty, which he sees may have a longer-lasting impact on prices than expected due to retaliatory tariffs and their effect on intermediate goods. that sounds like a long way to say stagflation. meanwhile, eric and donald trump, jr. launched a bitcoin mining firm and talked crypto up. is this all-american speculation, trumpian grifting, or a signal on a future us policy pivot towards a neutral reserve asset? moreover, gold prices hit a new nominal record high of 3,133, up 37.5 over a year in which some wereare still thinking about rate cuts! if that doesnt underline the structural uncertainty we are dealing with, not a lot does. lets finish by paraphrasing winston once more markets are drunk on uncertainty today, and tomorrow they may be sober, but the global backdrop will still be ugly. allow me to add by diligent effort, they must learn to like it.

  Title: Trump claims U.S. industry ‘reborn’ as he imposes sweeping tariffs on his highly touted ‘Liberation Day’
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-02 21:42:53)
  Content: president falsely claims that tariffs will be paid by foreign countries even though they are paid by american importers and passed on to consumers as higher prices from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. donald trump has announced an across-the-board tax on all imported goods purchased by americans and additional taxes on imports from countries which officials deem to be placing unfair barriers on the importation or sale of american goods. the president unveiled the measures on what he called liberation day, in an effort to forcibly undo decades of globalization and reindustrialize a u.s. economy that has become increasingly dominated by services and knowledge-based work in recent years. speaking at a long-anticipated event in the white house rose garden, trump said wednesday would forever be remembered as the day american industry was reborn, the day americas destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make america wealthy again. after a series of whipsaw days in the market ever since trump began his saber rattling about tariffs on mexico, canada and just about any other country, making the announcement after markets closed made sense to prevent a large market sell-off or a decline in stocks. he announced that starting at midnight, american will at minimum pay what he called a 10 percent baseline tariff on all imports to help rebuild our economy and to prevent cheating. but trump went further by announcing how americans would, starting in just a few days, face the effects of his administration imposing 54 percent taxes on all chinese imports a new 34 percent tax plus the 20 percent tax that is already in place, 20 percent on all imports from european union countries, 32 percent on imports from vietnam, 24 percent on imports from japan, using what white house officials described as a formula that bases the tax rates on americas trade deficits. he also claimed that foreign nations would finally be asked to pay for the privilege of access to our market, the biggest market in the world, even though foreign countries do not pay tariffs because tariffs are taxes paid by american importers and often passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. its unclear whether trump, a billionaire whose administration is staffed with some of the wealthiest people in the united states, understands the pain his administrations policies could impose on voters who elected him to bring prices down, though he did say americans might have to go through a little tough love as a result of the new tariffs. as he sought to explain and justify his policies, the president painted a morose and depressing picture of americas world-leading economic position as having been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike for decades and said he was signing an executive order that amounts to our declaration of economic independence that would make america great again, greater than ever before by taxing americans without a single vote cast in congress. he claimed the reciprocal tariffs import taxes paid by american importers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices will let his administration use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt. jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country, and you see it happening already. we will supercharge our domestic industrial base. we will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers, and ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers. this will be, indeed, the golden age of america. its coming back. were going to come back very strongly, he said. trump then accused some of americas closest allies of having taken advantage of american generosity by having their own domestic industries while not adopting policies to encourage consumers to purchase american products, particularly with automobiles. he said his administration will impose a 25 percent import tax on any foreign-made automobiles starting at midnight on thursday while castigating south korea and japan for not buying enough american cars. in many cases, the friend is worse than the foe in terms of trade, but such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base and put our national security at risk, he said. the president accused american allies of having ripped off the united states and harmed american workers, who he said have watched in anguish as foreign leaders stole american jobs. foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful american dream, he said. in remarks that alternated between bellicosity and historical and economic illiteracy, the president claimed america had suffered a decline in national wealth because of the imposition of income taxes starting in 1913, rather than the tariffs that had financed federal operations during americas early years when the countrys central government was far more limited in scope. for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax so that citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run our government, trump said, again deliberately repeating his false claim about tariffs being paid by foreign governments rather than americans. he went on to suggest that the great depression following the 1929 stock market crash could have been avoided had the income tax never been instituted and claimed wrongly that the u.s. would have had a much different story had the disastrous smoot-hawley tariff of 1930 been permitted to save our country. administration officials routinely describe trumps unilateral tax increases as his fulfilment of campaign promises to bring manufacturing back to american shores, even as his use of tariffs has alienated some of the countrys closest allies and roiled financial markets over his first three months in the white house. almost all mainstream economists and financial experts have decried his policies as the opposite of what the u.s. needs to bring down the record inflation that has plagued american consumers over the last three years. but the presidents top aides, including commerce secretary howard lutnick, u.s. trade representative jamieson greer and white house trade adviser peter navarro have indulged his taste for tariffs despite pleas for him to stop from business leaders. a senior administration official who briefed reporters on trumps plans described the united states the worlds largest economy as a helpless victim of nefarious conspiracies by allies and trading partners and said the rest of the world punishes us not only with their own tariffs but with higher non-tariff barriers the official called far worse, such as currency manipulation that tax distortions, dumping and export subsidies, punitive technical barriers, ridiculous agricultural constraints, sweatshop labor, pollution havens, widespread counterfeiting and intellectual property theft. as bad as the higher tariffs are, the non-tariff barriers are worse maybe a lot worse, said the official, who spoke to reporters on the call about what he described as decades of failure in reporting on globalizations pitfalls, as well as what he called false predictions that the tariffs trump imposed during his first term would cause inflation. a second official stated that trumps announcement would mark the start of a new era in a way that the world has not seen since the u.s. helped establish the post-second world war international trading order, including by helping found the world trade organization and other international organizations that he mocked as no longer fit for our time in our economic situation. nearly every major metric by which to measure the economy shows that not only would the tariffs fall onto the consumer, but that it could also lead to a word economists dread stagflation, wherein prices rise while unemployment also spikes. inflation kills re-election prospects, as president joe biden and nearly every other major world leader learned in 2024 as part of a global anti-incumbent wave. but stagflation is cataclysmic, as the late president jimmy carter could have told trump. but the white house has insisted that this would not be inflationary. the atlanta federal reserves gdpnow model projected that gross domestic product would contract by 3.7 percent, which is lower than it was last week. the institute for supply management reported on tuesday that economic activity contracted in march. but markets and the federal reserve are not the only group becoming nervous about this. even a handful of republican senators are revolting against the tariffs. sen. rand paul, an idiosyncratic libertarian republican from kentucky, teamed up with sen. tim kaine, a democrat from virginia, to repeal trumps tariffs with canada. but other republicans are also nervous about it, particularly republicans from swing states. ahead of the announcement, sen. thom tillis of north carolina, perhaps the most endangered republican incumbent, explained his concerns despite the fact he said he wont support kaine and pauls bill. im assuming worst case scenario, the likely retaliations in the way theyll affect farm country, and in my case, specifically north carolina, access to markets, he told the independent, adding he wanted to see that every single possible contingency and retaliatory measure has been anticipated. perhaps mindful of this, trump waited to announce his liberation day reciprocal tariffs until 400 pm on wednesday. he did not choose that time by accident. trump chose that specific time because it would come just as the new york stock exchange rang its closing bell to end day trading. sen. chuck grassley of iowa said he worried about a 25 percent tariff on potash, which is used to grow corn and soybeans, from canada, adding he wanted to see if he could get a waiver on potash. the nature of trumps tariffs policy meant that even up to the final minute, even some republicans did not know what would happen. do you even know that theyre going into play today? sen. lisa murkowski of alaska, whose state borders canada, asked the independent in response to a question. i dont either. so hold on tight. markets will likely be holding on tight as well come opening bell on thursday morning. trump has effectively bet his entire legacy on the tariffs, ensuring that it will usher in his proposed new golden age of american prosperity. but as of right now, the world, markets and even many in his own party remain unconvinced. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
