  Title: UN researchers warn that Asian scam operations are spreading across the rest of the world
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-21 15:23:50)
  Content: bangkok ap transnational organized crime groups in east and southeast asia are spreading their lucrative scam operations across the globe in response to increased crackdowns by authorities, according to a u.n. report issued on monday. for several years, scam compounds have proliferated in southeast asia, especially in border areas of cambodia, laos and myanmar, as well as in the philippines, shifting operations from site to site to stay a step ahead of the police. more recently, scam centers that have bilked victims out of billions of dollars through false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes are now being reported operating as far afield as africa and latin america. asian crime syndicates have been expanding operations deeper into remote areas with lax law enforcement that are vulnerable to the influx, according to the report issued by the u.n. office on drugs and crime or unodc. the report is titled inflection point global implications of scam centers, underground banking and illicit online marketplaces in southeast asia. this reflects both a natural expansion as the industry grows and seeks new ways and places to do business, but also a hedging against future risks should disruption continue and intensify in southeast asia, benedikt hofmann, unodcs acting regional representative for southeast asia and the pacific, said in a statement. unodc estimates that hundreds of industrial-scale scam centers generate just under 40 billion in annual profits. the trend to hedge beyond the region has been consistent with continued reports of crackdowns targeting asian-led scam centers that have been found operating in africa, south asia, the middle east and select pacific islands, as well as related money laundering, people trafficking and recruitment services discovered in europe, north america and south america. in africa, nigeria has become a hot spot, with police raids in late 2024 and early 2025 leading to many arrests, including people from east and southeast asia suspected of cryptocurrency and romance scams. zambia and angola have also busted asian-linked cyberfraud operations. in latin america, the report says that its notable that brazil has emerged as one country that has faced a growing set of challenges related to cyber-enabled fraud, online gambling, and related money laundering, with some linkages to criminal groups operating in southeast asia. it also notes that in late 2023 in peru, more than 40 malaysians were rescued after being trafficked by a taiwan-based gang known as the red dragon syndicate that forced them to commit cyber-enabled fraud. the report also points to crackdowns on asian-led scam centers in the middle east and some pacific islands. alarmingly, even as asian-led groups have been expanding the geographical scope of their operations, the involvement of criminal groups from other parts of the world is also growing, the report says. new online markets, money laundering networks, stolen data products, malware, artificial intelligence and deepfake technologies are laying the ground for the rise of crime as a service, the report says. these technological innovations facilitate conducting their businesses online and adapt to crackdowns. the convergence between the acceleration and professionalization of these operations on the one hand and their geographical expansion into new parts of the region and beyond on the other translates into a new intensity in the industry one that governments need to be prepared to respond to, hofmann says.

  Content: cape canaveral, fla. ap nasas lucy spacecraft has beamed back pictures from its latest asteroid flyby, revealing a long, lumpy, odd-shaped space rock. the space agency released the images monday, a day after the close approach. it was considered a dress rehearsal for the more critical asteroid encounters ahead closer to jupiter. this asteroid is bigger than scientists anticipated, about 5 miles 8 kilometers long and 2 miles 3.5 kilometers wide at its widest point resembling an irregular bowling pin. its so long that the spacecraft couldnt capture it in its entirety in the initial downloaded images. data returned over the next week should help clarify the asteroids shape, according to nasa. lucy passed within 600 miles 960 kilometers of the harmless asteroid known as donaldjohanson on sunday in the main asteroid belt between mars and jupiter. its named for the paleontologist who discovered the fossil lucy 50 years ago in ethiopia. the spacecraft was launched in 2021 to study the unexplored so-called trojan asteroids out near jupiter. eight trojan flybys are planned through 2033. ___ the associated press health and science department receives support from the howard hughes medical institutes science and educational media group and the robert wood johnson foundation. the ap is solely responsible for all content.

  Title: Stock market rallies after closed-door remarks by Treasury Secretary Bessent - Fortune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 20:15:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The recurring mentions of 'Trump tariffs' and 'Trump policy changes' alongside discussions of corporate hits (RTX), market reactions ('volatility spike', 'markets open sharply higher'), and geopolitical shifts ('softens on china', 'china de-escalation') align with aspects of Political Economy theory. This perspective suggests that political decisions and the actions of key political figures (like Trump) are not merely isolated events but have direct, measurable consequences on economic actors (companies like RTX, markets) and international economic relations (China trade). The text provides evidence of this linkage by explicitly connecting policy actions (tariffs, changes) to economic outcomes (hits, market shifts).; Theories_and_interpretations: The juxtaposition of headlines about market reactions to political statements ('investors are finally taking trump seriously', 'markets open sharply higher after trump softens') and the mention of 'agenda-setting' in the context of financial news (implied by the focus on specific topics like tariffs, Fed Chair, China) could be viewed through the lens of Agenda-Setting Theory. While typically applied to media influence on public perception, here it highlights how the *focus* of political figures (Trump's statements on China, Powell) can directly influence the *agenda* of financial markets and news coverage, demonstrating the power of political rhetoric to shape economic attention and action, as evidenced by the immediate market response described.; Intriguing_angles: The text mentions 'doges staffing cuts' as a cause for the IRS's 'nightmare' tax season and potential refund delays. The term 'doges' is unusual in this context and lacks clear identification as a standard entity type (Organization, Government Agency). Its significance lies in being presented as a direct causal factor for a major government agency's operational failure, yet its nature remains undefined within the article. What entity or concept does 'doges' represent in this context, and why is it presented as a singular, impactful cause without further clarification?

  Title: M&A Activity Remains Quiet Amid Uncertainty About New Administration
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-22 15:47:03)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article reflects elements of Realism in international relations. The IMF's revised growth forecasts, triggered by Trump's tariffs and subsequent retaliatory measures, demonstrate how states prioritize relative gains and security, even at the expense of absolute economic benefits. "the imf attributed the 0.9 percentage point downgrade primarily to the introduction of reciprocal tariffs announced by president donald trump april 2. these tariffs have since been suspended, but the damage has been done." This highlights the potential for protectionist policies to disrupt global economic stability.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the IMF's growth forecast was compiled in less than 10 days due to the sudden policy changes. This raises the question of whether such a rapid assessment could fully account for the long-term economic consequences of the tariffs. What biases or limitations might be introduced by this expedited process, and how might they affect the accuracy of the forecast?

      (No specific snippets retrieved for this entity in this article)
  Content: fifth third bancorp executives highlighted their proactive management and the banks ability to navigate uncertain environments during a conference call thursday april 17 discussing first-quarter earnings. they said these qualities are especially relevant at times like the present, when potential tariffs could lead to any number of different scenarios through the remainder of the year. we cannot predict what the final tariff policies will look like, much less what the second-order effects on economic activity, fiscal policy and monetary policy will be, fifth third chairman, ceo and president tim spence said during the call. what we can do is to ensure that our business mix is more naturally resilient, run our balance sheet defensively and maintain optionality so that we can react quickly as conditions change. the ohio-based indirect parent company of fifth third bank is pursuing several strategies to maintain resilience amid this uncertainty, spence said. these include diverse national loan origination platforms that provide flexibility in generating loan growth investments in southeast branches and commercial payments that provide granular operational deposit funding and credit concentration limits that ensure a diversified portfolio across asset classes, industries and regions. the bank also highlighted its proactive approach to managing credit risk its diversified fee income sources and day-to-day management that maximizes optionality. spence said during the call that he traveled to meet with around 50 business owners in the five regions served by the bank and in sectors like materials, manufacturing, transportation, logistics, energy, automotive and healthcare to get their views on recent tariff announcements. while all the business owners said they were surprised by the magnitude of the announced tariffs, they were split about how the tariffs might play out, spence said. half of the business owners viewed the tariffs as a negotiating tactic, while the other half expressed concern that higher tariffs would remain in place on major supply chain countries like china and vietnam. nearly all the business leaders said they would need to push prices to offset tariff costs because they have limited ability to absorb these costs in margins, he said. what was maybe a little bit interesting to me is that the folks that have domestic supply chains were also saying they have to move prices in the u.s. because theyre expecting that if the tariffs hold, theyre going to experience volume losses in foreign markets, and they require a certain amount of gross margin dollars just to be able to cover overheads and run their businesses, spence said. amex projects resilient consumer demand, anchored by gen z and millennial

despite economic uncertainties, vc and private equity investment in fintech is showing signs of recovery at least as seen through several recent announcements. current funding trends indicate a strong focus on b2b fintech solutions and platform development across the globe. investment activity is decidedly international in scope, with significant funding rounds for companies based in latin america, africa, india and europe, alongside activity in the u.s. the fintech landscape is being altered by the news this week of the global payments and fis dealmaking. tens of billions of dollars are attached to the transactions, focused on merchant services and embedded finance. the dollars are not flowing between the big guns in the payments space recent announcements of new funding rounds indicate a bit of buoyancy in money flowing to the smaller firms innovating digital payments, in both consumer-facing and b2b settings. and the investment activity, on the part of vcs and private equity firms, has been international in scope. its been widely reported that coming into 2025, fintech capital raising had hit a nadir in the fourth quarter of last year, with 21 billion representing the lowest level since 2016. more recently, as of this week, the data for the first quarter indicate that, as sp global has estimated, fintechs grabbed about 8 billion, up 46 from last year. the impact of tariffs, and dislocation in the capital markets, wed note, sharpened in april, and so any recovery may be volatile, to say the least. but even amid the tariff and trade wind dramas, recent announcements show that capital raises, though relatively small in terms of dollar amounts, are focusing on international players and platforms. plaids a standout here, having announced a 575 million funding round led by franklin templeton, alongside fidelity management and research and others, including existing plaid investors nea and ribbit capital. as reported this week, toku, an accounts receivable saas platform focused on latin america and based in chile, said it had raised 48 million in series a funding, bringing its total funding to 55 million. the announcement noted that the firms software connects companies erps with banks and payment rails, enabling payment orchestration and automated collections along with automated reconciliation in the back office. toku says it increases automated payment methods for enterprises from 10 to 90. pymnts reported tuesday april 15 that south africa-based payments infrastructure company stitch raised 55 million in a series b funding round to expand its offerings for enterprise merchants. the company said it will use the new funding to deepen its in-person payments offering, bolster its online payments suite and move into the acquiring space. stitch is now expanding its in-person payments solution and said it will add acquiring to its services list soon. the funding round had been led by qed investors. in india, varthana, a fintech that operates in the education financing space, has gathered 8.7 million in debt funding from b2b platform ofbusiness, through its oxyzo financial services unit. the funding will reportedly be used to back school loans extended to students. separately, warsaw-based startup bidfinance, the fintech behind a platform for trading debt portfolios, has raised eur 1.6 million in funding from venture capital funds 4growth vc, fundingbox, and a group of business angels. the capital will help support international expansion. a bit closer to home, in the states, as reported here, deck raised 12

user-permissioned data from more than 100,000 providers in more than 40 countries to, among other things, automate billing. this week in fintech from latin america to africa, funding focuses on b2b

  Title: UN researchers warn that Asian scam operations are spreading across the rest of the world
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-21 15:23:50)
  Content: bangkok ap transnational organized crime groups in east and southeast asia are spreading their lucrative scam operations across the globe in response to increased crackdowns by authorities, according to a u.n. report issued on monday. for several years, scam compounds have proliferated in southeast asia, especially in border areas of cambodia, laos and myanmar, as well as in the philippines, shifting operations from site to site to stay a step ahead of the police. more recently, scam centers that have bilked victims out of billions of dollars through false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes are now being reported operating as far afield as africa and latin america. asian crime syndicates have been expanding operations deeper into remote areas with lax law enforcement that are vulnerable to the influx, according to the report issued by the u.n. office on drugs and crime or unodc. the report is titled inflection point global implications of scam centers, underground banking and illicit online marketplaces in southeast asia. this reflects both a natural expansion as the industry grows and seeks new ways and places to do business, but also a hedging against future risks should disruption continue and intensify in southeast asia, benedikt hofmann, unodcs acting regional representative for southeast asia and the pacific, said in a statement. unodc estimates that hundreds of industrial-scale scam centers generate just under 40 billion in annual profits. the trend to hedge beyond the region has been consistent with continued reports of crackdowns targeting asian-led scam centers that have been found operating in africa, south asia, the middle east and select pacific islands, as well as related money laundering, people trafficking and recruitment services discovered in europe, north america and south america. in africa, nigeria has become a hot spot, with police raids in late 2024 and early 2025 leading to many arrests, including people from east and southeast asia suspected of cryptocurrency and romance scams. zambia and angola have also busted asian-linked cyberfraud operations. in latin america, the report says that its notable that brazil has emerged as one country that has faced a growing set of challenges related to cyber-enabled fraud, online gambling, and related money laundering, with some linkages to criminal groups operating in southeast asia. it also notes that in late 2023 in peru, more than 40 malaysians were rescued after being trafficked by a taiwan-based gang known as the red dragon syndicate that forced them to commit cyber-enabled fraud. the report also points to crackdowns on asian-led scam centers in the middle east and some pacific islands. alarmingly, even as asian-led groups have been expanding the geographical scope of their operations, the involvement of criminal groups from other parts of the world is also growing, the report says. new online markets, money laundering networks, stolen data products, malware, artificial intelligence and deepfake technologies are laying the ground for the rise of crime as a service, the report says. these technological innovations facilitate conducting their businesses online and adapt to crackdowns. the convergence between the acceleration and professionalization of these operations on the one hand and their geographical expansion into new parts of the region and beyond on the other translates into a new intensity in the industry one that governments need to be prepared to respond to, hofmann says.

  Title: Tariff Turbulence Hits Crypto: Short-Term Volatility Masks Potential Long-Term Gains
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-03 23:46:43)
  Content: as president donald trumps latest tariff announcements sent shock waves through global markets, the cryptocurrency sector found itself caught in the crossfire, raising questions about the long-term implications for crypto and blockchain. the immediate reaction in the crypto market was one of volatility. bitcoin fell as much as 5 from its recent highs to trade around 82,000. ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies also suffered losses, with ethereum dropping below 1,800. this volatility led to liquidations in crypto futures totaling over 450 million in the past 24 hours. the sell-off reflects a broader risk-off sentiment, as investors retreated from volatile assets in favor of traditional safe havens like gold. despite the short-term turmoil, some analysts see potential long-term benefits for cryptocurrencies. the tariffs could erode the u.s. dollars dominance in global trade, potentially boosting non-sovereign assets like bitcoin as alternatives for cross-border transactions. additionally, as economic instability deepens, bitcoin might emerge as a store of value, akin to digital gold, especially if central banks adopt accommodative monetary policies. however, this optimism is tempered by the recognition that cryptocurrencies are viewed as risk assets, closely tied to macroeconomic trends. industry experts are weighing in on the potential long-term effects of these tariffs on the crypto sector. for now markets hate uncertainty, so we can expect to see even more choppy trading in the coming weeksmonths and a delay to the next spike up either way it is only a delay that is unless president trump has yet another strong statement about the crypto industry up his ever expanding sleeve, said stephen wundke, director of strategy and revenue at quantitative digital asset investment firm algoz. the one thing we know for certain is that nothing, currently emanating from the white house, is certain. the tariffs could also impact the blockchain ecosystem more broadly. disruptions in global supply chains could affect miners and blockchain developers, particularly if components like semiconductors become more expensive due to tariffs. however, the decentralized nature of blockchain technology might also provide opportunities for innovation in cross-border transactions, potentially mitigating some of the negative effects of tariffs. while trumps tariffs have introduced significant uncertainty into the global economic landscape, the crypto and blockchain sectors are poised to navigate these challenges. in the short term, volatility and risk aversion may dominate, but the long-term prospects for cryptocurrencies as stores of value and mediums of exchange remain promising. as the world adjusts to these new economic realities, the resilience and adaptability of crypto and blockchain technologies will be crucial in determining their future role in the global financial system. were always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors. report justice department will not block capital one acquisition of discover tariff turbulence hits crypto short-term volatility masks potential long-term gains amazon tests agentic ai that helps customers buy from other sites tariffs and enterprise ai headline this weeks b2b innovations the justice department reportedly told financial regulators that it didnt have sufficient evidence to block the proposed merger between capital one and discover. this decision would allow the two banking regulators that must approve the deal the federal reserve and the office of the comptroller of the currency to approve the transaction, bloomberg reported thursday april 3. the justice department told the regulators of its decision in a confidential memo, the report said, citing unnamed sources. the justice department did not immediately reply to pymnts request for comment. staff at the justice department were divided about whether the merger should be challenged, and the new antitrust division chief, gail slater, made the decision that there was not enough evidence to do so, according to the report. earlier, under the biden administration, antitrust officials at the justice department had said they had some concerns that the deal could harm competition, per the report. under the biden administration, the justice department looked at not only the competitive factors of the deal, which is what it normally focuses on in bank mergers, but also how the deal might affect different customer segments, fees, interest rates, bank locations, product variety, network effects, interoperability and customer service, the report said. capital one announced its planned acquisition of discover in february 2024, saying the deal would create a global payments platform with 70 million merchant acceptance points in more than 200 countries and territories. our acquisition of discover is a singular opportunity to bring together two very successful companies with complementary capabilities and franchises, and to build a payments network that can compete with the largest payments networks and payments companies, richard fairbank, founder, chairman and ceo of capital one, said at the time in a press release. the deal took a step toward completion in december when it received approval from the office of the delaware state bank commissioner. it took another step forward in february, when the two companies said that more than 99 of their shareholders had voted to approve the merger. when announcing the votes, capital one said it expected the transaction to close early this year, subject to approval by the federal reserve and the office of the comptroller of the currency. were always on the lookout for opportunities to

  Content: taken from cnbcs daily open, our international markets newsletter subscribe today psychologist carl jung believed in the collective unconscious, a universal mind all humanity is tapped into. in the context of the financial world, the stock market as something ostensibly based on concrete numbers, but most of the time driven by instinctive hopes and fears kind of works like that. it is, in other words, essentially a tracker of sentiment. nowhere is this function clearer than the discrepancy between stocks moves during regular trading hours modest climbs, prior to u.s. president donald trumps triumphant unveiling of his tariff plan, and extended trading precipitous plunges, when investors had time to digest and suffer indigestion from the sheer weight of the white houses heavy tariffs on countries across the globe. trump teased leniency on tariffs days before revealing his cards. that quality of mercy was nowhere to be seen the tariffs appear sweeping and severe. to call trumps tariff plan a seismic shift in the economic and financial world order might be an understatement. it could take time for price changes to filter into the economy. but the stock market, as the collective unconscious of investors, could register this shock in the coming days. tariffs for allu.s. president donald trump announced wednesday sweeping tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories. the plan imposes a 20 levy on the european union, 46 on vietnam, 32 on taiwan and 34 on china which comes on top of the 20 already existing making the total tariff on beijing 54. there will also be a 10 baseline tariff on all u.s. imports. get updates on ongoing tariff developments on cnbcs live blog. manufacturing in vietnam threatenedfor years, vietnam was a popular alternative for companies, such as footwear brands and furniture manufacturers, trying to avoid the crossfire of u.s. trade tensions with china. but trumps planned 46 tariff on vietnam will change the picture. shares of nike, steven madden and american eagle slumped in extended trading after trumps announcement. the question now is whether and where those firms could move their manufacturing. tech stocks slumpapple shares sank more than 6 in late trading wednesday and led a broader decline in tech stocks after trumps tariff announcement. apple manufactures most devices in china. nvidia, which produces new chips in taiwan, fell about 5.7. u.s. treasury secretary scott bessent said wednesday the sell-off in the stock market is due more to a sharp pullback in the biggest technology stocks instead of white house trade policies. u.s. stock futures crateru.s. stock futures plunged in extended trading wednesday after trump unveiled extensive tariffs. as of publication time, futures tied to the dow jones industrial average lost 1.9, sp 500 futures tumbled 2.8 and nasdaq-100 futures slumped 3.5. shares of multinational companies fell in extended trading. during regular trading earlier in the day, all three major indexes closed higher. the pan-european stoxx 600 index was down 0.5. tesla disappoints on deliveriestesla on wednesday reported 336,681 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2025. thats a 13 decline from a year ago, and is below the 360,000 and 370,000 deliveries expected by investors, according to streetaccount. however, shares of the company rose 5.3 on reports that ceo elon musk would leave his role at the so-called department of government efficiency in the coming months though musk discredited that idea. pro worse than the worst case scenariotrumps extensive tariffs rollout on wednesday was worse than the worst case scenario, dan ives, global head of technology research at wedbush securities, wrote in a wednesday note following the white house announcement. here are the stocks that ives will be keeping an eye on because of heavy import levies. amazon submits bid for tiktok as ban deadline nears amazon sent a bid to the white house to purchase the social media app tiktok from its chinese owners, according to a source familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the discussions are confidential. the parties are not treating the bid seriously, however, given that it was submitted just days before a deadline staving off a u.s. ban is set to expire, the person said. the e-commerce companys offer, which was first reported by the new york times, comes as tiktoks fate in the u.s. is up in the air. the short-form video app faces another potential shutdown in the u.s. on april 5 if bytedance, its parent company, cannot reach a deal to divest tiktoks american operations. got a confidential news tip?

  Title: US Stock Market Live: Dow futures fall 250 points; Dollar index falls below 99 mark - CNBC TV18
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-21 02:14:48)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying the theory of Economic Protectionism (or modern Mercantilism), the article's detailed account of 'president donald trumps tariff push,' 'stepped up his tariff campaign,' and his assertion that the 'usa is getting rich on tariffs' serves as direct textual evidence. This theoretical lens suggests that the reported economic consequences—such as gold's rise as a haven asset, anticipated damage to the 'global economy,' and export contractions in South Korea—are presented not merely as market fluctuations but as the intended, albeit perhaps contested in their efficacy, outcomes of a deliberate policy strategy aimed at altering trade balances and domestic conditions.; Theories_and_interpretations: From the perspective of Agenda-Setting Theory, the article's consistent linking of diverse economic phenomena—from gold prices and IMF forecasts to South Korean exports and US public opinion on the economy—back to the 'us-led trade war' and 'tariffs' is significant. The text repeatedly uses phrases like 'underpinned demand,' 'since president donald trumps tariff push,' 'amid trade tensions,' and 'risks... from trumps protectionist policies' to establish this connection. This framing suggests the article prioritizes the trade conflict as the central explanatory factor for current economic conditions, potentially influencing readers to view these events primarily through that specific lens, even when other contributing factors (like specific company performance) are mentioned.; Intriguing_angles: A notable point within the text is the direct contradiction between President Trump's claim that the 'usa is getting rich on tariffs' and the finding from the CNBC survey that he is 'registering the worst economic approval numbers... amid broad discontent over his handling of tariffs.' This juxtaposition, presented without explicit resolution, is intriguing. It highlights a tension between the stated policy goal/perceived outcome by the policymaker and the reported public experience/perception. What might be the implications of presenting these conflicting views side-by-side without further analysis? Could this structure encourage the reader to question the validity of one claim over the other, or perhaps consider the complexity of assessing economic policy impacts?; Intriguing_angles: The article attributes broad market movements (Dow Jones, Nasdaq falling) primarily to the trade war narrative and critiques of Fed policy, yet it also explicitly mentions specific, non-trade-related corporate events—UnitedHealth's earnings guidance cut and selling pressure in Nvidia shares—as direct causes for significant index drops. The text states UnitedHealth 'cratered over 22' and 'put pressure on the dow jones,' and Nvidia selling pressure meant the 'nasdaq also could not sustain the gains.' This raises a question about the article's dominant framing: To what extent are the market fluctuations truly driven by the overarching geopolitical/macro narrative versus being significantly influenced by these specific, micro-level corporate developments? Does the emphasis on the trade war potentially oversimplify the complex interplay of factors affecting market performance?

  Content: gold rose to a record as the us-led trade war underpinned demand for haven assets, with data due in the coming days that may highlight early signs of damage to the global economy. bullion for immediate delivery climbed above 3,364 an ounce, as the dollar fell. on tuesday, the international monetary fund is set to lower its outlook for growth, while purchasing manager indexes the following day will offer a broad snapshot of economic activity since president donald trumps tariff push. bullion traded as much as 1.1 higher at 3,364.41 an ounce, before trading at 3,363.34 at 840 a.m. in singapore, as the bloomberg dollar spot index fell 0.5. silver rose, platinum was little-changed, and palladium declined. chinese copper smelters boosted output to a record high last month, as rising prices for by-products including gold and sulphuric acid eased pressure on margins. smelters in the worlds biggest copper producer have struggled with low profitability and pressure for production cuts after their rapid expansion outpaced global ore supplies, pushing processing fees below zero. that blow has been softened this year by gold extending its breakneck rally and more revenue from sulphuric acid thats sold to other industries. production of refined metal rose 8.6 in march from a year earlier to 1.25 million tons, according to chinas national bureau of statistics. that was just above the previous monthly high of 1.24 million tons in december last year. china expectedly kept its loan prime rates unchanged monday, with the 1-year lpr at 3.1 and the 5-year at 3.6 as the central bank appears to prefer stabilizing the yuan amid trade tensions with the us the decision from the peoples bank of china comes as china reported better-than-expected economic data this month, with first-quarter gdp growing at 5.4 year on year. the 1-year lpr influences corporate and most household loans in china, while the 5-year lpr serves as a benchmark for mortgage rates. the pboc has kept the lprs steady since october last year. president donald trump is registering the worst economic approval numbers of his presidential career amid broad discontent over his handling of tariffs, inflation and government spending, according to the latest cnbc all-america economic survey. the survey found that the boost in economic optimism that accompanied trumps reelection has disappeared, with more americans now believing the economy will get worse than at any time since 2023 and with a sharp turn toward pessimism about the stock market. the survey of 1,000 americans across the country showed 44 approving of trumps handling of the presidency and 51 disapproving, slightly better than cnbcs final reading when the president left office in 2020. south koreas early trade data showed that exports contracted so far this month after donald trump stepped up his tariff campaign, clouding the growth outlook for the asian export powerhouse. the value of shipments adjusted for working-day differences fell 5.2 from a year earlier in the first 20 days of april, according to data released monday by the customs office. that compared with a 5.5 rise reported earlier for the full month of march. after hiking duties on imports of metals in march, trump imposed a 25 tariff on auto imports and a 10 levy on all other shipments earlier this month. the slowing momentum for exports underscores the risks to south koreas export-driven economy from trumps protectionist policies. asia-pacific markets opened mixed monday as investors awaited chinas rate decision at a time when the yuan has come under pressure due to beijing-washington trade tensions. japans benchmark nikkei 225 fell 0.43 at the start of the day, while the broader topix index lost 0.35. in south korea, the kospi index increased 0.11 at the open while the small-cap kosdaq was flat. benchmark indices in japan are set to open on a negative note after ending in the green during thin trading last friday, when most global markets were shut. markets in hong kong and australia remain shut today as well due to the easter holiday. heres what the us president wrote on truth social on thursday evening with regards to the fed chair and his warnings on the us economy due to the tariff policies the ecb is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, too late jerome powell of the fed, who is always too late and wrong, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete mess! oil prices are down, groceries even eggs! are down, and the usa is getting rich on tariffs. too late should have lowered interest rates, like the ecb, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. powells termination cannot come fast enough! despite closing in the green, the sp 500 ended 1.5 lower for the truncated week. the dow jones and the nasdaq fell for the third day in a row and lost more than 2 each during the four-day period. it was also the seventh negative week for wall street out of the last nine. in a rare instance last thursday, the dow jones fell over 500 points, while on the flip side, the sp 500 managed to close in the green. this was due to shares of unitedhealth, the largest constituent on the dow jones, with a 9 weightage, which cratered over 22 in a single session after cutting its full-year earnings per share eps guidance. that put pressure on the dow jones. the nasdaq also could not sustain the gains due to selling pressure seen in nvidias shares. stock futures on wall street began trading on a negative note on sunday evening us time, as other global markets also return after a long weekend. futures on the dow jones are down nearly 200 points, while those on the sp 500 and the nasdaq are down 25 points and 100 points respectively. hello and welcome to cnbc-tv18s live coverage of the latest happenings on wall street. futures have opened lower on sunday evening, us time, after another down week. watch this space for all the live updates.

  Title: US Stocks Push Higher After Bessent’s Remarks: Markets Wrap - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 16:13:42)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article's emphasis on market reactions immediately following reports of potential policy shifts ('SP 500 rose... after bloomberg news reported closed-door comments') suggests that the *reporting* of information, even from private sources, is framed as a primary driver of financial sentiment. This highlights how media focus can influence what investors perceive as the most critical factors (trade tensions, Fed policy), potentially shaping market behavior based on perceived importance rather than solely on concrete economic fundamentals.; Theories_and_interpretations: The description of President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve ('berated powell for being slow to cut interest rates', 'concerns that trump may be preparing to fire powell') and the subsequent market 'reappraisal' of havens ('Trumps policies and his broadsides against the Fed have forced a reappraisal of the dollar and treasuries') aligns with aspects of Political Business Cycle theory. This perspective suggests that political actors may seek to influence monetary policy for short-term gains, and the market's reaction indicates a recognition of potential political interference impacting institutional independence and financial stability perceptions.

  Content: new york ap u.s. stocks fell wednesday after nvidia warned new restrictions on exports to china will chisel billions of dollars off its results, while companies around the world said president donald trumps trade war is clouding forecasts for how they and the economy will do this year. the sp 500 sank 2.2 after falling as much as 3.3 earlier. such an amount would have vied for one of its worst losses in years before the historic, chaotic swings that have upended wall street in recent weeks. the dow jones industrial average dropped 699 points, or 1.7, and the nasdaq composite sank a market-leading 3.1. losses accelerated after the head of the federal reserve said again that trumps tariffs appear to be bigger than it expected, which could in turn slow the economy and raise inflation more than it had earlier thought. but jerome powell also said again that the fed will need more time before deciding whether to lower interest rates, which could help the economy but make inflation worse, or to do the opposite. all of this is highly uncertain, powell said. were thinking now, really before the tariffs have their effects, about how they might affect the economy. thats why were waiting really to see what the policies ultimately are, and then we can make a better assessment of what the economic effects will be. some companies are already seeing big effects because of changes from washington. nvidia dropped 6.9 after it said the u.s. government is restricting exports of its h20 chips to china, citing worries that they could be used to build a supercomputer. the restrictions could mean a hit of 5.5 billion to nvidias results for the first quarter, covering charges related to inventory and purchase commitments. advanced micro devices sank 7.3 after it said u.s. limits on exports to china for its own chips may mean a hit of up to 800 million for inventory and other charges. in amsterdam, asmls stock sank 5.2. the dutch company, whose machinery makes chips, said demand for artificial-intelligence technology is continuing to drive growth. however, the recent tariff announcements have increased uncertainty in the macro environment and the situation will remain dynamic for a while, ceo christophe fouquet said. the uncertainty around trumps trade war has been scrambling plans for companies across industries and around the world. its so dynamic that united airlines gave two different financial forecasts for how it may perform this year, one if theres a recession and one if not. the airline said it made the unusual move to give twin forecasts because it believes its impossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence. uniteds stock finished roughly flat even though it reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. many investors are bracing for a possible recession because of trumps tariffs, which he has said he hopes will bring manufacturing jobs back to the united states and trim how much more it imports from other countries than it exports. a survey of global fund managers by bank of america found expectations for recession are at the fourth-highest level in the last 20 years. the world trade organization said wednesday it expects tariffs to cause a 0.2 decline in the volume of world merchandise trade for 2025. thats if the tariff situation remains as it was on monday. trade could shrink by 1.5 this year if conditions worsen, the wto said. the enduring uncertainty threatens to act as a brake on global growth, with severe negative consequences for the world, the most vulnerable economies in particular, director-general ngozi okonjo-iweala said. one u.s. company that moves products around the continent, j.b. hunt transport services, tumbled 7.7 for one of wall streets sharper losses, even though it reported slightly stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. all told, the sp 500 fell 120.93 points to 5,275.70. the dow jones industrial average dropped 699.57 to 39,669.39, and the nasdaq composite sank 516.01 to 16,307.16. tariffs could also drive up inflation, at least temporarily, by pushing u.s. importers to pass along the higher costs to their customers. fears about such price hikes drove a spending binge last month, and sales at u.s. retailers accelerated by more than economists expected. economists said much of that was likely because of u.s. shoppers rushing to buy automobiles, electronics and other items before their prices could rise due to possible tariffs. recent surveys have shown u.s. households are feeling more pessimistic about the economy because of tariffs, and a fear is that it could lead them to pull back on their spending eventually, which could cause a recession by itself. treasury yields eased in the bond market, taking a leg lower following the comments from the feds chair. the yield on the 10-year treasury fell to 4.28 from 4.35 late tuesday and from 4.48 at the end of last week. its another notable move for the bond market and somewhat of a return to form after an unusual rise in yields last week rattled investors and trump. treasury yields typically fall when investors are worried about the economy, and last weeks climb raised concerns that the trade war may be causing investors to second-guess the reputation of u.s. government bonds as one of the worlds safest possible

  Title: CNBC Daily Open: Trump’s desire to intervene in Fed could cause chaos
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-21 01:00:03)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Principal-Agent Theory, the article illustrates the tension between President Trump (the principal, driven by political incentives) and Jerome Powell/the Fed (the agent, mandated for economic stability). The text notes Trump's 'repeated calls for federal reserve chair jerome powell to cut interest rates' and the White House assessing 'whether they can remove the fed chair.' This highlights how the principal's desire for short-term economic boosts (pleasing the populace) can conflict with the agent's long-term goal of controlling inflation, suggesting structural challenges to central bank independence under political pressure.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article's focus on tariffs ('trumps tariffs, which are taxes on imports...') and fees on Chinese ships ('found chinas acts, policies and practices were unreasonable and burden or restrict u.s. commerce') aligns with Economic Nationalism. This theory interprets state actions as prioritizing domestic economic interests and power, often through protectionism and strategic industrial policy (like China's 'made in china 2025 plan' aiming for 'domestic dominance'). The narrative frames international economic interactions as a competition for advantage rather than purely free-market exchange.; Intriguing_angles: The draft executive order on the State Department, mentioned alongside economic news, proposes closing embassies and cutting bureaus for 'democracy and human rights, as well as international organizations like the united nations.' This detail, though brief, suggests a potential reorientation of U.S. foreign policy away from traditional diplomatic and values-based engagement. What might be the implications of de-emphasizing these foreign policy tools for the administration's economic and trade objectives? Could this indicate a shift towards a more transactional, economically-focused definition of U.S. global interests?; Intriguing_angles: The justification for U.S. fees on Chinese ships is attributed to an investigation by the 'biden-trump administrations.' This unusual phrasing suggests continuity in this specific area of trade policy across two distinct presidencies. What does the specific mention of the 'biden-trump administrations' imply about the bipartisan nature or deep-seated origins of concerns regarding China's trade practices? Could this phrasing be intended to lend greater policy legitimacy by framing the action as a consistent U.S. stance rather than a partisan initiative?

  Content: taken from cnbcs daily open, our international markets newsletter subscribe today an independent central bank is seen by most including this newsletter as the bedrock of a functional economy. officials steer the economy by calibrating the benchmark interest rate on which bank loans and mortgages, among other debt, are based. corporations and consumers, in general, like low interest rates because the cost of borrowing is cheaper. the former is incentivized to expand and invest, which, in turn, tend to increase income and spending among the latter. but such behavior can overheat the economy, causing prices to shoot up. u.s. president donald trumps repeated calls for federal reserve chair jerome powell to cut interest rates might make businesses and people happy at the cost of letting inflation run rampant again. factor in trumps tariffs, which are taxes on imports and hence fundamentally price increases, and inflation could be getting two shots in the arm. thats why central bankers tend to operate independently from the government. an administration that aims to please the populace might cut rates despite high inflation, leading to further economic difficulties. its a relief markets in the u.s. and europe were on a break for the good friday holiday when trump made his comments. trump again calls for powell to cut ratesu.s. president donald trump said friday that if we had a fed chairman that understood what he was doing, interest rates would be coming down, too. the white house said friday that officials are assessing whether they can remove the fed chair. this is not the first time trump has criticized powells approach to u.s. monetary policy. growing disapproval of trumps economic handlingaccording to a cnbc survey of 1,000 americans, 55 of respondents disapproved of trumps handling of the economy, the first time in any cnbc poll that he has been net negative on the economy while president. more americans now believe the economy will get worse than at any time since 2023, and they are sharply more pessimistic about the stock market, according to survey results. economic activity might fall off in summerthe u.s. economy could be experiencing an elevated level of activity now as shoppers and businesses stock up on goods before tariffs kick in, chicago fed president austan goolsbee said sunday. activity might look artificially high in the initial, and then by the summer, might fall off because people have bought it all. sectors most affected include the auto industry and electric components, goolsbee said. executive order to overhaul state departmentthe trump administration could soon roll out sweeping changes to the u.s. state department, according to a 16-page draft executive order obtained by cnbc. if enacted, the order would shutter american embassies across southern africa, eliminate bureaus that work on issues like democracy and human rights, as well as international organizations like the united nations. u.s. to impose fee on chinese-built shipsthe trump administration on thursday announced fees on chinese-built vessels after an investigation by the biden-trump administrations found chinas acts, policies and practices were unreasonable and burden or restrict u.s. commerce. the new fee charges are based on the net tonnage of a vessel. the fees will be charged once per voyage and not per port, as originally proposed. ukraine signs outline of mineral deal with u.s.yulia svyrydenko, ukraines minister of economic development and trade, said thursday the country and the u.s. had signed a memorandum of intent that was the basis of an agreement for both nations to jointly develop ukraines natural resources. however, on friday, u.s. secretary of state marco rubio said america will walk away from trying to broker a russia-ukraine peace deal within days unless there are clear signs that a deal can be done. pro earnings might displace tariffs as focusmarket gyrations because of trump tariffs might be subdued but not entirely subside this week, according to strategists. investor attention will turn to first-quarter earnings reports, with tesla and alphabet announcing their performance on tuesday and thursday, respectively. when beijing released its made in china 2025 plan in 2015, it was met with significant international criticism for promoting chinese business at the expense of their foreign counterparts. the country subsequently downplayed the initiative, but has doubled-down on domestic tech development given u.s. restrictions in the last several years. since releasing the plan, china has exceeded its goals on achieving domestic dominance in autos, but the country has not yet reached its targets in aerospace, high-end robots and the growth rate of manufacturing value-added the european chamber of commerce in china said in a report last week, citing its research and discussions with members. out of ten strategic sectors identified in the report, china only attained technological dominance in shipbuilding, high-speed rail and electric cars. got a confidential news tip? we want to hear from you. sign up for free newsletters and get more cnbc

  Content: taken from cnbcs daily open, our international markets newsletter subscribe today u.s. president donald trumps tariffs and subsequent actions by other nations have cast a shadow over investors portfolios. markets largely fell all around the world following the announcements, and the sell-off has extended into monday. trump and his administration has been defiant, with the u.s. president saying it wont be easy and urging americans to hang tough in a truth social post late friday. over the weekend, the european union was reported to also be readying tariffs, targeting up to 28 billion of u.s. imports, marking the latest escalation in this conflict. china and canada had also announced retaliatory measures last week. with such market losses, a predicted rise in consumer prices, and an increased risk of a recession from tariffs, it is admittedly hard to see what victory looks like for trump who said in 2018 that trade wars are good, and easy to win! markets set to extend lossesu.s. stock futures dropped on sunday evening, portending a third day of losses after a two-day historic stock market rout. dow jones industrial average futures fell 1,531 points, or 4 sunday evening, pointing to another brutal session ahead on monday. sp 500 futures shed 4. nasdaq-100 futures lost 4. on friday, the dow and sp 500 saw their worst losses since 2020, while the nasdaq composite entered a bear market after recording a 6 loss. crypto joins market routbitcoin fell below the 79,000 level sunday as investors braced for more financial market volatility. the cryptocurrency is down 15 in 2025 and, absent a crypto-specific catalyst, is expected to continue moving in tandem with equities as global recession fears overshadow any regulatory tailwinds crypto was expected to benefit from this year. tariffs are coming commerce secretary lutnickcommerce secretary howard lutnick said the white house will not postpone the april 9 start date for reciprocal tariffs. speaking to cbss face the nation sunday, lutnick said, they are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks, adding the president needs to reset global trade. everybody has a trade surplus and we have a trade deficit. bessent dismisses recession fears treasury secretary scott bessent on sunday dismissed concerns americans might be having about a potential impending recession and the status of their retirement plans, saying that president donald trump and his administration are building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity. speaking to nbc news meet the press, bessent called it a false narrative that americans who are close to retiring may be reticent to do so after their retirement savings may have dropped this week due to the stock market downturn. in fact, most americans dont have everything in the market, bessent added. berkshire hathaway weathers market routwarren buffetts berkshire hathaway fared better than the sp 500 in a brutal week as investors embraced the safety of a cash-rich conglomerate, seeing softer losses compared to the broad market index. domestically-oriented berkshire, which also owns large manufacturing, energy and retail businesses, is still up about 8 this year. china says market has spoken after trump tariffs spark global stocks rout chinas foreign ministry on saturday said the market has spoken following the u.s. imposition of sweeping new tariffs and called for the white house to defuse the escalating trade war through equal-footed consultation.this comes as u.s. markets fell sharply for a second consecutive day on friday, with all three major indexes dropping by more than 5 as part of a global rout. the market turmoil was exacerbated on friday when chinas finance ministry announced it would impose a 34 tariff on all goods imported from the u.s. starting on april 10. got a confidential news tip?

keep in mind that the biggest companies actually operate in the cluster of more suburban locales to the south, from mountain view to palo alto. historically, its completely normal for a product manager, engineer or marketeer to live in san francisco and jump on one of many company-specific paid-for buses that make the daily crawl about 45 miles south on the 101. theyre headed to a mega campus at one of the worlds biggest tech companies. think meta platforms inc., alphabet inc. and apple. but tech is indeed growing here. openai, arguably the worlds leading artificial intelligence startup, opened shiny new headquarters in san franciscos mission bay last month, reinforcing its commitment to the city while it expands elsewhere around the world. lurie cut the ribbon. at a smaller-scale, nintendo co., which delayed pre-orders of its next-gen console due to tariffs, is opening a flagship store in union square in a months time. on social media, there are lots of vcs and founders who feel san francisco is back in full force, driven in part by the boom in ai. lurie, a democrat, was elected on a promise to revitalize a struggling downtown and an openness to tax breaks for companies, including tech, that would contribute to the citys arts and culture scene. now in office, he tells me his major focus is the citys budget deficit. fix that and the rest will follow, he says. were working day and night to make sure that we tighten our belts, he said. we deliver core services to our taxpayers and to our residents, making sure that we focus on public safety, focus on the behavioral health crisis and the drug crisis that is causing people to feel, you know, the disorder on our streets. the mayors taken some early steps that can be labelled as tech-specific policy. for example, last week he authorized waymo robotaxis to soon drive down a portion of the citys currently car-free market street. while it was a public sign of lurie embracing technology, the move quickly drew ire from public transit advocates. the area of market in question has a hard stop on 10th street, requiring any rideshare or private cars to turn off it, while buses and taxis can proceed. so thats the pitch come to san francisco. its getting nicer and its the city all the people on the tech payroll want to live in. we have robotaxis. quoted he likes to take a nap, even on day trips. netjets internal document a document from private jet company netjets that was stolen in a cyberattack shows how crew members are instructed to serve a certain high-profile client elon musk. read the days most read story in tech and entertainment will apple shift iphone production to the us?

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
