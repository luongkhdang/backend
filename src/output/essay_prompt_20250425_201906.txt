  Content: here is how some of your favorite assets concluded the week. the week opened with bearish sentiment rippling through the crypto market as mantra om suffered a sharp crash, triggering widespread risk-off behavior. while fear gripped most sectors and numerous tokens faced drawdowns, ai-focused assets defied the trend. amid heightened volatility, these tokens capitalized on the markets uncertainty. hence, surging ahead to top the weekly gainers chart with impressive double-digit returns. core core surged 32.45 over the week, decisively breaking through the pivotal 0.60 resistance level, after two months of consolidation below this threshold. despite opening the week with a bearish gap, which extended the prior two-day corrective move, the selling pressure was swiftly absorbed, triggering a sharp rebound. that said, caution is warranted as overbought conditions begin to emerge. consequently, the probability of core continuing its bullish trajectory next week appears diminished, as the market may be facing a case of too much, too soon. furthermore, the 26 drop in trading volume, now at 32.52 million, supports this cautionary outlook. unless volume metrics show a reversal, the risk of a technical correction increases, potentially signaling a trend exhaustion. bittensor tao spearheaded the ai-driven rally this week, posting a 20.83 weekly surge to break through the key 300 resistance level. following a retracement to pre-election support levels, the asset initiated a relief rally, confirmed by four consecutive bullish daily closes, each establishing higher highs and breaching intermediate supply zones. source tradingview taousdt on the momentum front, relative strength index rsi is now showing a bullish divergence relative to prior local highs. hence, underscoring a potential momentum shift favoring the bulls and suggesting underlying strength in buying pressure. from a macro perspective, the move reinforces ambcryptos thesis of ai-native tokens outperforming in a risk-off environment, particularly as high-cap legacy assets consolidate or underperform with subdued weekly returns. additionally, the taobtc pair has reclaimed its early-march horizontal resistance, flipping it into new-found support, thereby adding confluence to the current bullish structure. taken together, these technical developments position tao for a potential continuation leg higher in the upcoming sessions. artificial superintelligence alliance fet logged an 18 weekly gain, placing it just behind tao on the leaderboard of top-performing assets. the breakout above the 0.50 resistance confirms bullish continuation from a prior accumulation range. however, the token is still capped below the 0.60 macro supply zone. hence, it could trigger a short-term mean reversion if bullish volume fails to expand. notably, fets price structure reflects calculated accumulation. daily candles show tight-bodied bullish closes, and volume has spiked 103 to 124.5 million a sign of controlled yet growing conviction. much like its ai counterpart, fet is benefitting from macro risk-off flows. a clean break above 0.60 could unlock a fresh leg up. failure to defend current levels, however, may invite profit-taking and a short-term retrace. beyond the leading performers, the broader market saw significant price action. voxies voxel led the charge with an explosive 425 rally, outpacing the top 1,000 tokens in terms of price momentum. lofi lofi and nkn nkn trailed closely, posting impressive gains of 158 and 138, respectively. mantra om closed the week as the markets worst performer, tumbling by a staggering 90.54, driven by a sharp deleveraging event that sent the token into a freefall. the crash was triggered on the 13th of april, when om collapsed from 6.35 to under 0.10 within a single session, marking a textbook case of a flash crash. this crash likely came from too many traders holding overleveraged long positions while the market was already overheated. technically, om broke through several key support levels with barely any buying interest, showing a clear breakdown in structure. source tradingview omusdt the rsi dropped below 18, showing extreme overselling. even though there were small bounces, the token hasnt formed a stable bottom yet. unless om can recover and hold above the 0.200.25 zone with stronger volume, the recent move looks more like a full reset than a short-term dip. while a temporary bounce could occur, overall sentiment around om and the broader rwa sector has taken a serious hit. movement move experienced a 32.21 weekly decline, positioning it as the second-worst performer of the week. notably, move is the only asset in the top 3 losers to extend its losses, highlighting continued bearish momentum. the week began with a breakdown below the critical 0.30 support level, which followed a period of consolidation, signaling weakening demand. given the absence of strong buyer absorption and a failure to establish a higher low, a strong reversal remains premature. until 0.30 is reclaimed with significant volume, move is at risk of further downside pressure, as market participants appear hesitant to enter long positions. the next support lies around the 0.20 zone, where the market may find temporary relief, but without a bullish catalyst, a corrective phase seems likely. walrus wal registered a 14.66 weekly retracement, sliding to 0.40 and ranking as the third-largest decliner over the past seven days. the correction effectively nullified prior upside momentum, reversing the gains from last weeks close at 0.52. however, a closer look at the 1d price structure suggests early signs of potential stabilization. wal closed the week with an 11.08 intraday rebound, lifting to 0.41 at press time. however, the move was followed by a swift 4.12 pullback, suggesting residual selling pressure into strength. that said, the 0.380.40 price band now acts as a key intraday support cluster. a sustained defense of this zone, ideally supported by rising obv, could pave the way for sideways consolidation in the near term. for now, directional bias remains neutral-to-bearish unless buyers reclaim initiative above 0.44. in the broader market, several tokens experienced notable price retracements. wayfinder prompt led the declines with a sharp 51 drawdown, followed by babyion baby and debridge dbr, which saw pullbacks of 43.7 and 40, respectively. heres the weekly recap of the top gainers and losers. given the markets inherently volatile nature, rapid price fluctuations are common. therefore, its crucial to conduct thorough due diligence dyor before making any investment decisions.

usually too late. short run, the market is a voting machine, warren buffett said. long term, the market functions as a weighing machine. most investors overlook the fact that anxiety, when it gets louder, becomes a major sign of forced selling. that is not a justification for running. this motivates one to start working. common investor fears during crashes rational thinking gives place to emotional survival when markets collapse quickly. fear takes over control it does not simply occupy the room. ive observed the same repeating worries afflicting investors during every significant downturn they are behavioral traps, loss aversion, recency bias, and herd mentality that drive investors into emotional decisions, irreversibly damaging capital. the prizes include they are the ones that interpret fear as a signal, not as a justification. the practical response the power of process over panic in falling markets, process serves as the shield while emotion is the enemy. there should be no guessing. volatility sharpens my research-driven, catalyst-led approach it does not disturb it. others rush for comfort or cash, but i follow discipline spotting dislocations, verifying catalysts, and precisely allocating. this is about becoming ready before it shows, not about forecasting the bottom. every crisis we have negotiated has made me more careful, more focused, and surer of our capacity to identify value when the noise level is highest. anxiety vanishes. process lives. what you should do now most investors seek an exit when fear rules the market. the brighter ones search for an edge. if you only learn one lesson from this article, let it be this sell since your premise is broken rather than selling since you are afraid. there is quite a great difference. at my company, the edge, we pay more attention to what is misinterpreted than to what is falling. this is the time to monitor insider buying since, although the public withdraws, insiders are often acting with conviction rather than emotion. this is also the moment to hone your attention on spinoffs, restructurings, and businesses experiencing true internal transformation rather than merely following what seems low-cost. use the crash to construct a future-oriented portfolio rather than to fix a faulty one. the market will bounce back, as it always does, but only those who used the drawdown sensibly will stand ahead. get ready to observe the process. back off. see the panic as an advantage. create a repeatable, not reactive, approach that will help you be more suited for what lies ahead than merely surviving what is now. final words this is the edge panic is noise. you are supposed to pick up the signal. do not herd like others. when others pause, look for mispriced opportunities, separate actual triggers, and act with confidence. while bad judgments do, crashes do not kill investors. process, patience, and preparation set long-term winners apart from the rest, not luck or timing. if this speaks to you and youre ready to stop reacting and start investing with intent, you can follow me here and also explore my book, price catalysts proven strategies for spotting profitable stock investments, more deeply. available on amazon. stocks 15 20 minute delay cboe bzx is real-time, et. volume reflects consolidated markets. futures and forex 10 or 15 minute delay, ct. market data powered by barchart solutions. fundamental data provided by zacks and morningstar. 2025 barchart.com, inc. .

thats when well see vix hitting levels in the 40s, 50s, and even higher. the nickname fear index might seem pretty self-explanatory here, but the vix can be considered more accurately as a reading of investor uncertainty. when the market is grinding slowly lower during the acceptance phase of a well-established bear market, it wouldnt be unusual to see a relatively modest vix reading corresponding with a steady downtrend. on the other hand, the vix can spike during periods of otherwise positive price action and in bull markets, particularly when elements of uncertainty are introduced that raise concerns about the potential impact on stocks - such as an unexpected election result. the vix itself is a statistic and cannot be traded directly, but theres an entire volatility industrial complex of futures, options, and exchange-traded notes etns for those looking to speculate on volatilitys next directional move. however, trading vix derivatives is quite a bit more complicated than it may seem. for example, options traders who are accustomed to american-style equity options might be surprised to learn that vix options are not only european-style - meaning they can be exercised only at expiration - but they also derive their value from vix futures contracts at settlement, as opposed to spot vix. so when you buy a vix call option, you dont just need a big spike in the fear index - you need a big spike in the correct synthetic 30-day vix futures contract at settlement which is more or less the derivatives trading equivalent of actually tossing that oversized ping-pong ball into the tiny mouth of a tilted jug at the state fair. and as for vix etns that look to replicate or even leverage the fear indexs daily swings - these complicated assets should be approached with extreme caution only by experienced investors with high risk appetites, super-short holding periods, and - this is key - a willingness to read the prospectus. we mentioned earlier that the vix reflects how much implied volatility is being priced into short-term options. and thats why a market crash is often the worst time to buy put options to bet on more downside - or even just to hedge your longs. when the vix spikes, put options bets that an assets price will decline get significantly more expensive as implied volatility increases. its almost like trying to buy insurance after your car is already wrapped around a tree its too late to protect against the worst, and so now the premiums have soared. thats why the best time to manage portfolio risk with put options is during periods of relative calm. learn more about managing volatility risk here. high-drama headlines about the vix arent going to improve anyones sentiment, but by understanding exactly what the fear index is measuring, how not to trade it, and how to properly manage your own portfolio risk, youll be able to keep your head up - even when all those around you are sending the vix to new highs. elizabeth h. volk, barcharts senior editorial director, contributed to this report. stocks 15 20 minute delay cboe bzx is real-time, et. volume reflects consolidated markets. futures and forex 10 or 15 minute delay, ct. market data powered by barchart solutions. fundamental data provided by zacks and morningstar. 2025 barchart.com, inc. .

  Title: Worries About Flying Seem to Be Taking Off. Here's How to Cope With In-Flight Anxiety
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-23 13:20:37)
  Content: new york ap adelynn campbells last plane trip ended with a panic attack that she got through largely with the help of a kind flight attendant. that was last year before 67 people died in january when an american airlines jet collided with a helicopter over washington, d.c., in the deadliest u.s. air disaster in almost a quarter century. now, campbell is even more hesitant to book a flight. its definitely spiked my concern about getting on a plane and its making the whole situation a little more stressful than it used to be, said campbell, 30, who manages a coffee shop in san diego. being at least a little nervous about flying is understandable. as mel brooks once said if god wanted us to fly, he would have given us tickets. but for some people it causes deep anxiety that could require professional help. heres a look at air travel anxiety and ways to cope with it. more people seem to be nervous about flying the evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say theyve seen and heard increased worries and not only in people who already had anxieties about flying. even people who didnt have a fear of flying are talking about it, given recent events, said jennifer dragonette, a california-based psychologist who treats people with air travel anxieties. u.s. air travel was down in march and early april compared with last year, according to tsa statistics. airlines have attributed the decline to economic uncertainty, a decline in government and corporate travel and yes concern about recent aviation incidents. faa officials recently acknowledged they werent doing enough to ensure air safety. recent polling by the associated press-norc center for public affairs research shows that fewer americans report feeling safe about flying this year. flight attendants who work planes out of the washington, d.c., airport were particularly rattled by the january collision, said sara nelson, president of the association of flight attendants union. some asked for time off to process their emotions, and at least one flight attendant left the job, she said. what is fear of flying? fear of flying sometimes called aerophobia goes beyond just being nervous about a flight. it is an intense form of anxiety that centers on certain aspects of air travel. many aerophobes get most rattled during take-off and landing, or when they think about being locked in a plane. some research has suggested it affects about 25 million u.s. adults. psychologists say it often surfaces in adulthood, developing in people who didnt mind flying as kids but grew more rattled as they aged. in many cases, it starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, at a time they are experiencing big life changes and new responsibilities like getting married or becoming a parent and they start to think that everything counts, said david carbonell, a chicago-based psychologist who authored a workbook to help people cope with flying fears. a bad flight with heavy turbulence or some other problem may trigger an anxiety that persists, he said. campbell, who has other forms of anxiety, developed a fear of flying a few years ago. she is transgender, and said travel can be stressful because of concerns about how shell be treated by airport security or in other interactions. aerophobia can be complicated, carbonell said. for many people, its not so much a fear of crashing as it is claustrophobic feelings of being in an enclosed cabin and not having control. campbell said thats what she experiences feeling trapped and unable to breathe. nelson said flight attendants regularly deal with suffering passengers weve had people have panic attacks, and weve had to give them oxygen. it can be quite intense. how to cope with flying anxiety statistics have long shown that airliners are probably the safest way to travel. according to the national safety council, the odds of dying in an airplane crash are too low to be calculated, based on 2023 statistics making them far, far lower than of being killed in a motor vehicle crash or, for that matter, walking on a sidewalk or crossing a street. but experts say you cant really reason your way out of an anxiety disorder. carbonell spends little time on statistics, telling patients i know you already looked at them all, and theyre not helping you. for people with milder levels of aerophobia, deep breathing often works. longer exhales help the body relax, said dragonette, who counseled campbell for aerophobia and other anxiety disorders at a newport healthcare residential facility in temecula, california. people suffering more extreme cases can be helped with exposure therapy. it can start by simply getting patients to become comfortable looking at photos of planes, watching videos of planes flying safely, or putting on a virtual reality headset that shows recordings of being inside a plane, dragonette said. its a matter of getting patients to learn to live with their feelings and better handle them. carbonell recommends patients take practice flights that do not involve work trips or any other responsibilities. when they have symptoms, he recommends they keep a written inventory. theyre keeping a simple count, he said. were using counting as a proxy for acceptance. its ok to ask for help nelson, who was a longtime united airlines flight attendant, says ive had situations where id sort of sit in the aisle and hold someones hand. on a frontier airlines flight last year from detroit to san diego, campbell tried breathing and other coping skills, but they didnt halt her panic attack. the passenger next to her noticed she was increasingly anxious, and summoned a flight attendant. the flight attendant took deep breaths with campbell and helped her get through it, and also took down campbells phone number and checked on her a day later. i was really impressed, she said. ___ the associated press health and science department receives support from the howard hughes medical institutes science and educational media group and the robert wood johnson foundation. the ap is solely responsible for all content. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Content: crypto liquid funds have taken a beating this year so far, with losses of up to 70, multiple investors i spoke to told me such figures are typically shared only internally and with limited partners. after a rough q1 2025, liquid fund investors are now concentrating on a smaller set of high-conviction bets. this cycle, fundamentals not momentum are driving decisions. most liquid funds entered the year strong but got crushed as financial markets, including crypto, were hit by broader turmoil from tariff policies to macro uncertainty. what started off as a very strong first few weeks saw the entire altcoin market collapsing starting in mid-january, said rob hadick, general partner at dragonfly. bitcoin btc 2.42 btc 2.42 87,297.95 see details is down 10 on the year, solana sol -0.87 sol -0.87 140.22 see details 30, and ether 50, and with many altcoins even worse, its been hard for funds to find a place to hide. most liquid funds bet heavily on solana in 2024, and that dragged down their returns this year so far, said jack platts, founder of hypersphere ventures. part of the drawdown is tied to expectations. with bitcoin now easily accessible to institutional investors via etfs, active managers are often explicitly asked not to hold it, said cosmo jiang, general partner at pantera capital, who oversees the firms liquid token strategies. investors look to liquid funds for exposure beyond bitcoin or even ether. still, bitcoin becomes the default benchmark for measuring liquid fund returns skewing perceptions of fund performance. but thats not an ideal benchmark, according to some investors. bitcoin as digital gold is categorically different from a defi token that resembles equity. no one benchmarks equity investor returns to gold, so why should we? said ryan watkins, founder of syncracy capital, a crypto hedge fund that has 9 figures in assets under management, meaning at least 100 million. jiang added that he also views the crypto universe as two tracks bitcoin as digital gold, and everything else as blockchain technology. one can succeed independently of the other, he said. not all liquid funds have struggled equally. directional strategies which bet on token prices going up or down took the biggest hit, especially in altcoin-heavy portfolios, investors said. market-neutral and delta-neutral strategies fared better, thanks to their focus on arbitrage, yield or other low-risk trades. i havent seen any market-neutral funds that have blown up or had a lot of issues. those generally make 1 to 2 per month, said platts of hypersphere ventures. liquid fund managers are cutting long-tail exposure and concentrating on tokens with fundamentals cash flow, usage and value accrual. overall, q1s poor performance has pushed liquid funds to shift their capital allocation strategies. several investors said theyve narrowed their exposure and are concentrating on fewer, stronger assets. were taking higher conviction bets, less investments, said platts. a portfolio of 20-plus altcoins underperforms a portfolio with six to 10 altcoins. some liquid funds are also exploring listed equities with crypto exposure, platts said, citing janover, which is aiming to become the microstrategy of solana. martijn van veen, managing director and partner of m11 funds, also said his firms and in general, liquid funds focus is now on quality tokens. we believe investors, i.e. funds like us, are gradually positioning themselves to start buying the quality tokens that can be valued more akin to traditional listed equities, van veen said. with more regulatory clarity coming up, especially in the u.s., this might be a trend to continue for some time. its premature to predict an altcoin season given current prices, but a flight to quality seems to be unfolding. van veen also revealed that m11 funds is preparing to soon launch a second liquid vehicle, the m11 crypto core fund, alongside its current m11 liquid token fund. m11 funds is part of m11 group, which also has a separate venture fund division called maven 11. meanwhile, defi and a few very selected layer 1 tokens remain in focus for liquid funds like defiance capital, which now prioritizes tokens with actual value accrual and fundamentals, said arthur cheong, the firms founder, ceo and cio. sam lehman, principal at symbolic capital, also said fundamentals are becoming central to investment theses, pointing to recent token investments by venture capital firms a16z crypto and 1kx in layerzero and layer3, respectively. that old crypto vc playbook investing via safts simple agreement for future tokens shortly before tge token generation event and seeking quick flips is becoming less viable due to longer lockups and the need for real business building, lehman said. that flexibility to invest in liquid tokens is becoming a priority for some other investors, too. hyperspheres fifth and latest venture fund has an open mandate to go up to 100 liquid if needed, platts said. he added that vc funds with flexible mandates are best positioned to catch mini-cycles in sectors like how ai agents had one recently. overall, the liquid side of crypto isnt just evolving its expanding. watkins of syncracy noted that venture fund returns have been weaker than liquid fund returns, deal quality is down, and the liquid market is now more attractive than before. theres simply not enough attractive opportunities in private markets, he said. van veen said most crypto allocations still lean venture-heavy today, but thats changing. and if crypto follows traditional finance, the direction is clear. in traditional finance, hedge funds are 10x larger than venture funds, said zaheer ebtikar, founder and cio of crypto hedge fund split capital. that may be where the crypto liquid fund industry is headed. to subscribe to the free the funding newsletter, . disclaimer the block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data. as of november 2023, foresight ventures is a majority investor of the block. foresight ventures invests in other companies in the crypto space. crypto exchange bitget is an anchor lp for foresight ventures. the block continues to operate independently to deliver objective, impactful, and timely information about the crypto industry. here are our current financial disclosures. 2025 the block. . this article is provided for informational purposes only. it is not offered or intended to be used as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

  Title: Stock market rallies after closed-door remarks by Treasury Secretary Bessent - Fortune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 20:15:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The recurring mentions of 'Trump tariffs' and 'Trump policy changes' alongside discussions of corporate hits (RTX), market reactions ('volatility spike', 'markets open sharply higher'), and geopolitical shifts ('softens on china', 'china de-escalation') align with aspects of Political Economy theory. This perspective suggests that political decisions and the actions of key political figures (like Trump) are not merely isolated events but have direct, measurable consequences on economic actors (companies like RTX, markets) and international economic relations (China trade). The text provides evidence of this linkage by explicitly connecting policy actions (tariffs, changes) to economic outcomes (hits, market shifts).; Theories_and_interpretations: The juxtaposition of headlines about market reactions to political statements ('investors are finally taking trump seriously', 'markets open sharply higher after trump softens') and the mention of 'agenda-setting' in the context of financial news (implied by the focus on specific topics like tariffs, Fed Chair, China) could be viewed through the lens of Agenda-Setting Theory. While typically applied to media influence on public perception, here it highlights how the *focus* of political figures (Trump's statements on China, Powell) can directly influence the *agenda* of financial markets and news coverage, demonstrating the power of political rhetoric to shape economic attention and action, as evidenced by the immediate market response described.; Intriguing_angles: The text mentions 'doges staffing cuts' as a cause for the IRS's 'nightmare' tax season and potential refund delays. The term 'doges' is unusual in this context and lacks clear identification as a standard entity type (Organization, Government Agency). Its significance lies in being presented as a direct causal factor for a major government agency's operational failure, yet its nature remains undefined within the article. What entity or concept does 'doges' represent in this context, and why is it presented as a singular, impactful cause without further clarification?

  Title: Delta removes an employee, changes its uniform policy after backlash over social media post perceived to be anti-Palestinian

  Title: First Thing: Markets plunge as IMF says Trump trade war poses ‘significant risk’ to global economy - The Guardian
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-04 10:18:00)
  Content: londons stock market opened at its lowest level since january, while france suggests pause on investing in the us. plus, what now for tiktok? donald trumps barrage of tariff announcements has wiped trillions of dollars off the value of the worlds largest companies and supercharged recession fears, with londons stock market opening on friday morning at its lowest level since january. wednesdays dramatic import tax announcements of between 10 and 50 are causing alarm around the world, with china condemning unilateral bullying practices and the french president, emmanuel macron, suggesting a pause on investing in the us. the international monetary fund has warned that trumps move poses a significant risk to the global economy. sell-offs have gone global, sending exchanges plunging in asia and europe. on thursday the three main us stock markets experienced their worst day since june 2020, during the covid pandemic. what has the political reaction been? there are some signs of a slight republican backlash, with the former senate majority leader mitch mcconnell calling tariffs bad policy that hurt ordinary americans. mcconnell and three other republican senators backed a democrat resolution demanding that the 25 tariffs on canadian products be reversed. get the latest from our business blog and our us politics blog. top congressional democrats on thursday denounced the reported dismissal of the national security agency director gen tim haugh, with one lawmaker saying it makes all of us less safe. the washington post reported late on thursday that haugh, who also coordinated the pentagons cybersecurity operations as head of us cyber command, had been dismissed. his civilian deputy at the nsa, wendy noble, was also fired. mark warner, vice-chair of the senate intelligence committee, asked at a time when the united states is facing unprecedented cyber threats how does firing him make americans any safer? representative jim himes, the ranking member on the house intelligence committee, said he was deeply disturbed by the decision, adding that he feared haugh may have been fired because he followed the law and put national security first. were others fired? yes trump said earlier on thursday that he had fired some white house national security council officials. the announcement came a day after the far-right activist laura loomer raised concerns with him about staff loyalty. the deadline for tiktok to divest or sell its assets to a non-chinese owner is again looming, on 5 april, with the future unclear for the app that is used by 170 million americans. the ban-or-divest deadline was pushed back in january by an executive order by president donald trump, who earlier this week said he would like to see tiktok remain alive. a handful of investors have said they are interested in the app, but bytedance, the chinese company that owns tiktok, has said it does not plan to sell. in court filings it said that divestiture is simply not possible not commercially, not technologically, not legally. where did the tiktok ban come from? it started with trump, who in 2020 said the chinese-owned app posed a danger to national security. it then became a bipartisan issue, with congress voting for a ban last year but trump has since made an about-face on the issue. south koreas constitutional court voted unanimously to uphold the impeachment of the countrys suspended president, yoon suk yeol, after he declared martial law in december. trump has reportedly threatened to freeze 510m in grants to brown university in rhode island as the administration cracks down on academic institutions in the wake of last autumns palestinian solidarity protests. israel has bombed a school-turned-shelter in gaza city and killed at least 27 people, rescuers said, as israel wages a new campaign to divide up the territory. teenage girls in england say they feel less safe at school since the pandemic, research has found, while a smaller decline has been observed in boys of the same age. in 2019, 43 of girls aged 13-14 in england strongly agreed that they were safe at school, but in the latest survey, carried out in 2023, that halved to 21. for boys in england over the same period the percentage fell from 41 to 31. ahead of the release of their second album this summer, wet leg open up about falling in love, feeling homesick, queer identity and the weirdest jobs theyve worked. i was a character at a theme park, rhian teasdale reveals, somewhat reluctantly. i was this thing called a squawk bird, a puppet you have to get inside. you have to make all the sounds. severe storms and tornadoes have killed at least seven people in tennessee and missouri, with further fatalities expected to be confirmed. indiana has declared a state of emergency over the severe weather, while warnings were issued in parts of arkansas, illinois, indiana, missouri and mississippi. the storms are now heading eastward, after leaving more than 213,000 households without power from texas to ohio. the climate crisis is intensifying the severity of tornadoes, scientists have said. whatever your best party trick is, chanel tapper and her 3.8in 9.75cm tongue probably have you beat. she can flip a red cup with it. remove jenga blocks from a stack. use it to pick up a spoon. but she still has the most fun just showing it to people and watching their reactions. people yell or scream in shock, or horror sometimes, and thats probably my favorite because its funny to me because its a dramatic response, the 34-year-old californian said. first thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday. if youre not already signed up, . if you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email newsletterstheguardian.com

  Title: Bitcoin Crosses Key Barrier, Dogecoin Spikes, Ethereum Flat On Easter Sunday: Popular Influencer Says BTC Needs To Breach $88,804 For A Bullish Breakout
  Source: www.benzinga.com (2025-04-21 02:28:57)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying behavioral economics theory, the article's emphasis on 'speculative demand' and the market remaining in the 'fear category' despite price gains suggests that investor psychology and sentiment, rather than purely rational factors or fundamental value, play a significant role in driving short-term price movements and volatility in this market. This aligns with behavioral finance observations where non-rational factors influence asset prices.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article's structure and content selection can be viewed through the lens of Agenda-Setting Theory. By focusing on specific cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin) and particular metrics (liquidations, open interest, long/short ratio, fear/greed index), the article directs the reader's attention to these aspects, thereby influencing what readers perceive as the most important developments in the market. The inclusion of expert opinions (CryptoQuant, Scott Melker) further reinforces the salience of these chosen topics and metrics.; Intriguing_angles: The text notes a surge in 'speculative demand' alongside a market sentiment that 'stayed in the fear category'. This juxtaposition is noteworthy because high speculative demand is often associated with bullish or greedy sentiment, not fear. What specific factors might explain the coexistence of high speculative demand and a 'fear' sentiment? Does this suggest a market driven by short-term bets rather than long-term conviction?; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that a 'cryptocurrency trading behemoth binance... faced withdrawal disruptions due to an amazon web services outage'. This highlights the reliance of a major crypto exchange on centralized cloud infrastructure. How does the reliance on centralized services like AWS impact the fundamental principles of decentralization often associated with the cryptocurrency ecosystem? What are the potential systemic risks if a major cloud provider experiences a prolonged outage affecting multiple exchanges?

  Title: ‘Airport Theory’ is a ridiculous conceit. Here’s mine, though
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-06 11:27:28)
  Content: the man who pays his way do you agree that early is on-time and on-time is late? from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. as theories go, airport theory is not really up there with evolution or relativity. it is a social media phenomenon in which travellers in the us time themselves going through american airports, from bag drop via security to boarding gate. the theory is that you can often whizz through in 15 minutes. but it is full of holes. for a start, normal passengers at new york jfk terminal 4 used by delta and virgin atlantic will be barely halfway through queuing for security by the end of the first quarter-hour. many airport theory influencers on tiktok and instagram have evidently paid around 80 62 for precheck a security fast track with the promise 99 per cent of passengers wait less than 10 minutes. all the airport theory videos i see are for us domestic flights, which means no labyrinthine duty-free spiral of doom to navigate, nor passport control. but attempting a schiphol scamper at amsterdam airport for a flight to the uk could end in tears possibly those of transit passengers skittled by a late-running influencer. ridiculous conceit that it is, at least airport theory invites travellers to consider how much time to allow before a flight. in the 1980s, the british airways shuttle allowed you to turn up at the gate at heathrow, edinburgh or glasgow 10 minutes before departure and still catch the plane paying for your ticket on board. when easyjet and ryanair began the no-frills revolution, each had a 20-minute check-in. but with expanding airports and increasing security, everything has got slower and more complicated. ryanair demands 40 minutes, while easyjet is up to an hour at some airports. i took a poll of colleagues about when they would arrive for a 1pm flight to malaga. all said two to three hours ahead apart from one who lives near heathrow and will allow 90 minutes with cabin baggage only and already checked in. so many potential hurdles stand between you and the boarding gate. one key variable is the time for airport security queue. outside the uk and us, you need to add in passport control. then theres uncertainty about the distance to the departure gate and the risk of a bus transfer to the plane which is likely to mean a rule of be at the gate 30 minutes ahead is strictly enforced. and with children in tow, you can more or less double everything. the consequences of missing your flight also vary. if its an easyjet hop on a route with lots of departures, if you miss it you can pay a rescue fare of 110 to get on the next available one. but if you have a business-class trip to australia, and a cruise booked at the other end, you will probably want to err on the side of an abundance of caution. one colleague insisted early is on-time and on-time is late. four hours ahead of departure, then? way too long. an hour and a bit is my policy. any more, and you will squander some of your valuable life in the airport, a location on a par with prisons and hospitals in terms of wanting to minimise the time spent there. except there are many more ways to relieve you of your cash while you wait. airports love dwell time, when passengers sip overpriced coffee or head for the shops. to reduce the time and money wasted at the airport, eliminate all the uncertainties you can, and then build in a bit of padding. on a trip to singapore earlier this year, i was glad to have followed my own advice. i turned up at heathrow 70 minutes before ba11 was due to depart. so when the a380 superjumbo was cancelled because of a technical problem, scuppering the plans of more than 400 passengers, i was still landside with no luggage to collect and could rearrange a flight immediately. when the travel gods conspire against you, though, do not hesitate to queue-jump. ask other less-pressed passengers if you might go to the head of the line. just make it clear you are not an airport theory influencer. simon calder, also known as the man who pays his way, has been writing about travel for the independent since 1994. in his weekly opinion column, he explores a key travel issue and what it means for you. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
