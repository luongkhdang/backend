  Title: Tariff turmoil: How Tesla and other companies are dealing with the uncertainty of the trade war
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-23 22:23:02)
  Content: new york ap uncertainty over tariffs and an unpredictable trade war is weighing heavily on companies as they report their latest financial results and try to give investors financial forecasts. some tariffs remain in place against key u.s. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. the tariff and trade picture has been shifting for months, sometimes changing drastically on a daily basis. those shifts make it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales. on tuesday, treasury secretary scott bessent said he expects a de-escalation in the trade war between the u.s. and china, but cautioned that talks between the two sides had yet to formally start. heres how several big companies are dealing with the tariff confusion tesla tesla is in a better position than most car companies to deal with tariffs because it makes most of its u.s. cars domestically. but it still sources materials from other nations and will face import taxes. the bigger impact will be seen in the companys energy business. the company said the impact will be outsized because it sources lfp battery cells from china. the broader trade war could also hurt the company as china, the worlds largest electric vehicle market, retaliates against the u.s. tesla was forced earlier this month to stop taking orders from mainland customers for two models, its model s and model x. it makes the model y and model 3 for the chinese market at its factory in shanghai. ceo elon musk, an adviser to president donald trump, on tuesday reiterated that he believes lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity. but he added that ultimately the president decides on what tariffs to impose. akzo nobel the amsterdam-based maker of paints and coatings for industrial and commercial use said the big risk from tariffs could come in the form of lower demand for its products. the company said almost all sales of finished goods in the u.s. were locally produced, with the majority of raw materials locally sourced. over the years, we deliberately localized both our procurement and production in the u.s., said ceo gregoire poux-guillaume, in a conference call with analysts. we also largely run china for china and use the rest of asia instead as an export base. the companys products range from paints and coatings for the automotive industry to the do-it-yourself homeowner. broader tariffs could squeeze consumers and businesses and hurt sales. boston scientific the medical device maker said it expects most of the effecs of tariffs to hit the company during the second half of the year, but that it can absorb the impact. the company raised its earnings and revenue forecasts for the year, despite the tariffs. it estimates a 200 million impact from tariffs in 2025, but said it can offset that through higher sales and reductions in discretionary spending. the company said it has a long-standing supply chain around the globe and has made significant investments in the u.s. boeing boeing said much of its supply chain is in the u.s. and many of its imports from canada and mexico are exempt from tariffs under an existing trade agreement. the company does have suppliers in japan and italy, but it expects to recover those tariff costs. the net annual cost of higher tariffs on the supply chain is less than 500 million. a bigger concern is the potential for retaliatory tariffs, which could impact its ability to deliver aircraft. china, a key target for u.s. tariffs, has retaliated in part by no longer accepting deliveries of boeing aircraft. att att, like its peers in the telecommunications sector, faces higher costs for cellphones and other equipment. the company said it believes it can manage anticipated higher costs, based on the current pause in some tariffs and its supply chain. the magnitude of any increase will depend on a variety of factors, including how much of the tariffs the vendors pass on, the impact that the tariffs have on consumer and business demand, said ceo john stankey, on a conference call with analysts.

  Title: Pope Francisâ€™ conservative critics had a unique way to oppose him: a retired pontiff
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-22 16:36:55)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article highlights how Pope Francis's critics actively worked to shape the narrative surrounding his papacy, using various platforms like social media and conferences. 'From individual protests to social media campaigns, conferences and petitions, conservatives made clear they believed themselves to be more catholic than the pope and forged unusually vocal resistance to his authority.' This demonstrates an attempt to influence public perception and potentially sway future papal elections.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Francis's tolerance of right-wing opposition, even seeming to 'relish in the criticism as evidence of how far a church obsessed with rules and regulations had strayed from jesus gospel-mandated call.' This raises the question: Was this tolerance genuine, or a calculated strategy to highlight the perceived rigidity of his opposition and further legitimize his reforms?

  Content: vatican city ap as amazonian bishops gathered at the vatican on oct. 21, 2019, a man entered a nearby church after dawn and stole three indigenous statues brought to rome for the occasion. he threw them into the tiber river in a videotaped protest to denounce what he called the pagan idolatry taking place on pope francis watch. the incident underscored the lengths to which pope francis traditionalist critics were willing to go to vent their opposition to historys first latin american pope. from individual protests to social media campaigns, conferences and petitions, conservatives made clear they believed themselves to be more catholic than the pope and forged unusually vocal resistance to his authority. their token leaders in the college of cardinals will likely be maneuvering to ensure someone more sympathetic to their sensibilities will be elected to replace francis, who died monday at 88. some wanted me dead every pope has his critics. and francis probably expected he would face opposition to his radical reform agenda after catholics for two generations grew used to more conservative popes. some wanted me dead, he quipped once after he heard some prelates in rome had started plotting a future conclave while he was in the hospital. francis critics were unique in having a living alternate as a point of reference, pope benedict xvi, who resided as pope emeritus in the vatican gardens for the first decade of francis pontificate. such an anomaly made the dynamics of the francis opposition a historical first. it exacerbated divisions that experts say must be addressed before another pope decides to step down. they say norms are necessary to prevent a retired pope from being an inspiration for the faithful in ways that discredit his successor or impact his leadership. francis tolerated the right-wing opposition for a while, often responding to their attacks with silence. at times, he even seemed to relish in the criticism as evidence of how far a church obsessed with rules and regulations had strayed from jesus gospel-mandated call to welcome the stranger, feed the poor and show mercy to all. its an honor if the americans attack me, he once said, referring to the u.s.-based nexus of opposition. after benedicts death in 2022, francis tried to blunt the opposition and consolidate his progressive reforms, even though it seemed the right-wing knives were out for him. within days of benedicts funeral, his longtime secretary published a tell-all memoir highly critical of francis. it also emerged posthumously that cardinal george pell wrote a devastating memo that circulated anonymously, calling francis pontificate a catastrophe. while saying he welcomed criticism, francis tried to neutralize the opposition through key appointments and targeted removals, even while trying to make the church a welcoming field hospital for wounded souls, especially lgbtq catholics. after one gesture of outreach francis approved blessings for same-sex couples african bishops united in disapproval in a remarkable continent-wide dissent to a papal directive. if you look at all the history of the reform of the church, where you have the strongest resistance or debated points, its really usually a very important point, said sister nathalie becquart, who helped spearhead one of francis progressive agenda items to make the church more responsive to the needs of laypeople. wary of francis from the start conservative and traditionalist catholics were wary of francis after their beloved benedict became the first pope in 600 years to resign. they grimaced when francis emerged on the loggia of st. peters basilica after his 2013 election without the ermine-rimmed, red velvet cape of his predecessors. they gasped a few weeks later when he washed the feet of women and muslims on holy thursday, a ritual previously restricted to men. we dont like this pope, headlined italys conservative daily il foglio a few months into his papacy. the dictator pope was the title of book by a british traditionalist published a few years later. over time, the critics worst fears came true. one breaking point came in 2016, when francis opened the door to letting divorced and civilly remarried catholics receive communion. some accused francis of heresy. four conservative cardinals formally asked him to clarify himself, issuing dubia or questions to him. they argued church doctrine held that catholics who remarried without a church annulment were living in sin and couldnt receive the sacraments. he never replied. reversing benedict on the latin mass conservatives could not have known that francis would take one of the most controversial steps of his pontificate by reimposing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass that benedict had relaxed. the reversal of benedicts signature liturgical legacy was evidence that francis had essentially declared war on traditionalists, the ancient liturgy and benedicts papacy itself. francis hates us. francis hates tradition. francis hates all that is good and beautiful, the traditionalist blog rorate caeli tweeted. but it concluded francis will die, the latin mass will live forever. francis insisted his aim was to preserve church unity. critics accused him of the opposite, of driving a wedge, and the outrage wasnt limited to u.s.-based conservative catholic media or fringe right-wing bloggers who had popularized francis-bashing. cardinal raymond burke, one of the dubia prelates whom francis sacked early on as the vaticans supreme court justice, blasted the severity of the papal crackdown. guinean cardinal robert sarah, the vaticans retired liturgy chief, responded with tweets quoting benedicts original 2007 law to relax the restrictions that francis had overturned. they were accompanied by a photo of benedict wearing the red cape that francis had eschewed the night of his election. a year earlier, sarah orchestrated a media firestorm by persuading benedict to co-author a book reaffirming priestly celibacy at a time when francis was considering ordaining married men to address a clergy shortage in the amazon. the book, and the prospect of a retired pope trying to influence a reigning one, created the nightmare scenario that canon lawyers and theologians had warned of in 2013, when benedict decided to retain the white cassock of the papacy in retirement and call himself emeritus pope, rather than revert to his birth name. the scandal died down after benedict removed himself as a co-author and francis fired his secretary, archbishop georg gaenswein, believed to have been behind it. after benedict died and gaenswein penned his highly critical, tell-all memoir nothing but the truth, francis exiled him from the vatican. then, after a time in his native germany, made him an ambassador. after burke joined a bigger group of cardinals questioning francis 2023 synod on the churchs future, francis cut him off financially. francis was more tolerant with another critic, the retired archbishop of hong kong, cardinal joseph zen. he excoriated the pope for agreeing in 2018 to a deal with china over the nomination of bishops, accusing francis of selling out chinas underground catholics who stayed loyal to the holy see during decades of persecution. francis received zen at the vatican and later called him a tender soul. francis won few friends with his frequent denunciations of clericalism the idea that priests should be put on a pedestal. he made it a tradition to use his christmas greeting to publicly shame vatican bureaucrats, accusing them of being careerist, money-grubbing gossips with spiritual alzheimers. german cardinal gerhard mueller complained that francis treated vatican monsignors like uneducated children. a major u.s. critic emerges francis biggest conservative critic was the vaticans former ambassador to the u.s., archbishop carlo maria vigano. in 2018, he said francis had covered up accusations that then-cardinal theodore mccarrick, an american, had slept with his seminarians. vigano demanded francis resign for allegedly rehabilitating mccarrick from sanctions imposed by benedict. the furor faded after francis defrocked mccarrick and vigano was discredited with conspiracy theories about covid-19. mccarrick died earlier this month. in 2024, francis excommunicated vigano after finding him guilty of schism. papal biographer austen ivereigh said francis dismantled much of the resistance. he lists the amazonian synod as a defining positive moment of his pontificate - not because of the incident with the statues but because the meeting emphasized his key pastoral priority of accompanying the faithful. the native peoples of amazonia were right here in st. peters square, and francis walked across to the synod with them, ivereigh said, recalling the feathered headdresses and indigenous statues that were on display. the pastor among his people, walking together. and i thought, that is him. that sums him up, he said.

to purchase, with higher broad-based tariffs, mcconnell said after his vote. center-right media hammered trump on thursday while us allies showed no signs of backing down and instead openly plotted their own tariff measures in response. a trade war appears imminent on the road ahead. assuming the policy sticksand we hope it doesntthe effort amounts to an attempt to remake the u.s. economy and the world trading system, the murdoch-owned wall street journal editorial board wrote thursday morning. if the response is widespread retaliation, the result could be shrinking world trade and slower growth, recession, or worse, the journal continued. there will certainly be higher costs for american consumers and businesses. on the bulwark, host jonathan last sarcastically quipped thursday the woke socialist markets do not seem to appreciate the brilliance of trumps beautiful, very strong tariffs. the white house fired out its own news release highlighting praise from a handful of industry trade groups, as well as republican members of congress. but over wednesday evening and thursday morning the media and economic experts spent the hours picking apart apparent inconsistencies and other confusing aspects of the liberation day announcement. a top target of ridicule for the white houses usual critics were the 10 percent duties levied on the heard and mcdonald islands, a remote pair of islands controlled by australia with no human population and extremely limited fishing activity, according to forbes. virtually zero exports from the penguin-infested rocks reach the us. impressed the crack white house economic team not only found the heard and mcdonald islandsan uninhabited australian territory which is a two week sail from the mainland requiring a permit to visitbut that they managed to figure out the optimal retaliatory tariff to impose on penguins, wrote justin wolfers, a senior fellow at the brookings institution. on consumer news channel cnbc, one reporter could not hide his disdain for the formula used to calculate the reciprocal tariffs put into place by the white house, which according to a number of economists did not appear to actually factor in tariffs put into place by us trade partners. i started calling international trade economic experts, steve liesman said on the network thursday morning. nobody ever heard of this formula. nobody has ever used this formula. so im sorry, but the conclusion seems to be that the president kind of made this up as he went along. he made it up. ian bremmer of the eurasia group, added this is incredibly stupid. yales nonpartisan budget lab was out with increasingly dire predictions for the us economy after the presidents announcement this week. clothing and apparel prices are set to spike by nearly 20 percent nationwide, according to an analysis published wednesday, while the overall economy will shrink and american households in the middle income bracket will be hit with an annual income loss of around 1,700. i expect the fallout to continue into next week, as everyone is trying to assess what the effect will be on final consumer prices, michael tamvakis, a professor and economist with city st. georges university of london, told the independent on thursday. i imagine any good not available in the domestic us market will be affected, especially any food commodities which have to be imported promptly and have a short shelf life, tamvakis predicted. electronics, pharmaceuticals and auto sales would be among the sectors affected immediately, he explained, with higher drug prices in particular having the potential to hurt poorer americans the most. with the trump administration under a self-acknowledged mandate to bring down consumer prices and inflation, the president could be setting republicans up in a very uncomfortable spot come midterm season. the state of the us economy is likely to be very close to the top of voters minds as congressional reelection campaigns begin in earnest next year and later in 2024, for some. high grocery prices and other issues caused by a trade war could easily lead voters to hand the house back to democratic control for the remainder of trumps term, even if the senate remains out of reach. the real danger trump faces could be from dividing the coalition which has now elected him twice traditional republican voters who want to see the us economy grow and thrive, and maga true believers who are willing to see a contraction if it means reorganizing the economy under an america first vision. democrats, of course, are counting on this as their party continues to grapple with a crisis of confidence. voters remain unhappy with congressional democrats, especially senate minority leader chuck schumer, amid the doge-ification of the federal government and the collapse of democratic resistance in the senate, both in the face of the laken riley act and more recent government shutdown fight. schumer, who saw his party shed three seats in the senate last year, maintains that he still has a winning record in terms of both elections and legislating. a tanking us economy could make that pronouncement a reality come next year. if trump doesnt see things turn around for the us economy before the end of the year, he could well end up handing schumer a lifeline right when his rival needs it most. join thought-provoking

  Title: Wall Street reacts to Trump's reciprocal tariffs

  Content: reuters -president donald trump said on wednesday he would impose a 10 baseline tariff on all imports to the united states and higher duties on some of the countrys biggest trading partners, a move that could escalate a trade war and upend the global economy. trading partners are expected to respond with countermeasures that could lead to dramatically higher prices for everything from bicycles to wine. u.s. automakers are looking at steps they can take in the shorter term to mitigate tariffs, such as working with suppliers on any items that can be moved to the u.s. quickly without significant investment. but massive longer-term investment decisions require more time and certainty. the current u.s. automakers playbook is not enough, and they are facing a watershed moment. its an opportunity for automakers to do things differently. lean into emerging technology like ai across their business. explore and decide on alliances faster. speed up vehicle production cycle times. on the supply side, this watershed moment offers opportunity in the chaos for mergers and acquisitions. david mccall, president, united steelworkers usw international we must ensure our trade policy targets cheaters rather than trusted economic allies like canada. we should be working to build relationships - not barriers - with partners who have proven their commitment to joining us in tackling global overcapacity. the administration must also take steps to prevent companies from using tariffs as an excuse to price gouge consumers. nigel green, ceo, global financial advisory firm devere group this is how you sabotage the worlds economic engine while claiming to supercharge it. its a seismic day for global trade. trump is blowing up the post-war system that made the u.s. and the world more prosperous, and hes doing it with reckless confidence. tariffs are taxes - plain and simple - and american consumers will bear the brunt. the reality is stark, these tariffs will push prices higher on thousands of everyday goods - from phones to food - and that will fuel inflation at a time when it is already uncomfortably persistent. mike hawes, ceo, uks society of motor manufacturers and traders these tariff costs cannot be absorbed by manufacturers, thus hitting u.s. consumers who may face additional costs and a reduced choice of iconic british brands, whilst uk producers may have to review output in the face of constrained demand. seth goldstein, morningstar analyst on u.s. chemicals i see lower volumes as a result of tariffs. the tariffs will likely be passed along to raise price of end-market products to consumers. in turn, i expect we see consumers buy fewer goods. due to the high fixed-cost nature of chemicals production, lower volumes would have an outsized impact on profits, so we could see another year of declining profits if widespread tariffs are implemented. however, many chemical producers make their products in the u.s. to be sold domestically, so we see less of a direct impact. david french, executive vp of government relations at national retail federation more tariffs equal more anxiety and uncertainty for american businesses and consumers. tariffs are a tax paid by the u.s. importer that will be passed along to the end consumer. tariffs will not be paid by foreign countries or suppliers. we encourage president trump to hold trading partners accountable and restore fairness for american businesses without creating economic uncertainty and higher prices for american families. art wheaton, director of labor studies, ilr school, cornell university it will take years and billions of dollars to bring manufacturing jobs from new plants online, whereas expansions at existing factories could happen much sooner. however, companies prioritize stability - frequent policy changes can delay investment decisions as businesses wait for clearer, long-term signals before committing capital. michael ashley schulman, partner and cio at running point capital advisors possibly, trump in addition to bringing back manufacturing to the u.s. and leveraging our advanced robotics within our shores for that manufacturing renaissance, may also be trying to truly muck up the chinese economy and heighten their economic instability. 34 tariffs on chinese goods could either force many chinese manufacturers to close, increasing unemployment and social instability in china, andor force a temporary price level adjustment within the u.s. for chips, pcs, semiconductors and server manufacturers, these tariffs, if they hold, will be quite disruptive. investors, analysts, politicians, and the market will be on bated breath to see what is now negotiated between countries following this liberation day volley from the administration. hopefully, todays announcement is a worst case scenario, and any negotiations create improvements from here. with valuations skyrocketing in 2024, many investors are uneasy putting more money into stocks. unsure where to invest next?

  Title: Tariff turmoil: How Tesla and other companies are dealing with the uncertainty of the trade war
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-23 18:00:42)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article illustrates Realism through the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. The text states, 'the broader trade war could also hurt the company as china, the worlds largest electric vehicle market, retaliates against the u.s.' This demonstrates states (U.S. and China) acting in their self-interest, using economic tools (tariffs) as weapons in a power struggle. This interpretation suggests that economic policies are not solely driven by economic factors but are also tools for geopolitical competition.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'some tariffs remain in place against key u.s. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate.' This postponement, without specifying which tariffs or partners, is intriguing. What specific conditions or concessions are being sought during these negotiations, and why are some partners prioritized over others? This raises questions about the underlying power dynamics and strategic considerations driving the U.S.'s trade policy.

  Title: Trump announces huge new tariffs to promote US manufacturing, risking inflation and trade wars
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 20:57:51)
  Content: by josh boak associated press washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the new tariffs, coming on what trump has named liberation day, are a bid to boost u.s. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he says are years of unfair trade practices. but by most economists assessments, the move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and upend decades-old alliances. the white house is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble. april 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern american history, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said tuesday. she said the new tariffs would take effect immediately. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. based on the possibility of broad 20 tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. because trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. leavitt is among three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the associated press on first and fifth amendment grounds. the ap says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. the white house says the ap is not following an executive order to refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america. associated press writers mike householder in oldcastle, ontario, sylvie corbet in paris and lisa mascaro contributed to this report.

reacted with shock and concern on wednesday to the sweeping series of tariffs donald trump announced on all u.s. trading partners. despite the trump administration framing the measures as a way to bolster u.s. manufacturing, those within american industry warned the tariffs might do the opposite. manufacturers are scrambling to determine the exact implications for their operations, national association of manufacturers president and ceo jay timmons said in a statement on wednesday. the stakes for manufacturers could not be higher. the tariffs, which trump continues to erroneously claim will mean other countries paying the u.s., will in fact threaten investment, jobs, supply chains, and, in turn, americas ability to outcompete other nations and lead as the preeminent manufacturing superpower, according to timmons. other industry leaders had a similar outlook. the national restaurant association warned the tariffs will create change and disruption, as small business owners struggled with increased prices. many restaurant operators source as many domestic ingredients as they can, but its simply not possible for u.s. farmers and ranchers to produce the volumes needed to support consumer demand, the groups ceo michelle korsmo said in a statement. what we have heard from business of all sizes, across all industries, from around the country is that these broad tariffs are a tax increase that will raise prices for american consumers and hurt the economy, the u.s. chamber of commerce added in a statement of its own. this is catastrophic for american families, matt priest, president and chief executive of the footwear distributors and retailers of america, told the new york times. we had hoped the president would take a more targeted approach, but these broad tariffs will only drive-up costs, reduce product quality and weaken consumer confidence. political reaction to the tariff plan which includes 25 percent tariffs on imported autos, 10 percent baseline tariffs on all imports, and double-digit reciprocal tariffs on numerous individual nations was split on predictable partisan lines, though a handful of senate republicans joined all democrats in the upper house for a largely symbolic vote wednesday evening to reject the national emergency determination the trump administration has used to justify tariffs on canada. democratic critics of trump hammered the president, arguing the tariffs would do the opposite of the republicans campaign promises to lower prices and aid american families. rep. nydia velazquez of new york warned in a post on x directed at trump of the working families, small businesses, and everyday americans getting crushed by your half-baked trade war. others emphasized that the tariffs, which, despite trumps claims to the contrary, are paid by u.s. companies importing goods, functionally act as tax hikes on u.s. consumers. donald trump just imposed the largest tax hike in our lifetime, california governor gavin newsom said on wednesday on x. liberal political commentator jonathan chait argued in the atlantic that trump, whose tariff plans sent stocks declining after hours and raised fears of a recession, might become the first one to kill off a healthy economy through an almost universally foreseeable unforced error. some cheered the economic overhaul. hes resetting the negotiating table. hes resetting the deck here, rep. andy ogles, republican of tennessee, said in a video statement on wednesday, adding, at the end of the day, i know trump is going to be proactive. hes going to put america first and put american workers first, which is what we should do. todays tariff action will cement president trumps legacy as one that ushered in a new golden age of american industrialization and prosperity, nick iacovella of the coalition for a prosperous america said on x. absolutely massive day for those of us that care about strengthening our nations industrial capacity and creating working-class jobs. on the international front, leaders also showed concern. it is the american people who will pay the biggest price for these unjustified tariffs, australian prime minister anthony albanese said after trumps announcement. we will do everything we can to work towards an agreement with the united states, with the goal of avoiding a trade war that would inevitably weaken the west

and computer chips. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose have caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy, despite the risk of political backlash as voters in last years election said they wanted trump to combat inflation. senior administration officials, who insisted on anonymity to preview the new tariffs with reporters ahead of trumps speech, said the taxes would raise hundreds of billions of dollars annually in revenues. they said the 10 baseline rate existed to help ensure compliance, while the higher rates were based on the trade deficits run with other nations and then halved to reach the numbers that trump presented in the rose garden. in a follow-up series of questions by the associated press, the white house could not say whether the tariff exemptions on imports worth 800 or less would remain in place, possibly shielding some imports from the new taxes. based on the possibility of broad tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most outside analyses by banks and think tanks see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnating growth. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress . president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. how will trumps tariffs work? how soon until prices might rise?apr. 2, 2025, 854 p.m. trump has blunt words on possible car price hikes amid new tariffsmar. 31, 2025, 956 a.m. because trump had hyped his tariffs without providing specifics until wednesday, he provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. powered by

  Title: Trumpâ€™s tariffs squeeze Republicans as they struggle to pass his agenda
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-04 23:51:54)
  Content: analysis trumps tariffs are making it harder for republicans to cut taxes and spending, eric garcia writes from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. if president donald trump hoped to get a better day on wall street two days after his massive tariff announcement, he was sorely mistaken. the dow jones industrial average closed on friday losing 2,231.07 points, or 5.50, another brutal dive. federal reserve chairman jerome powell spoke to journalists at a business reporters conference friday and while he did not comment on politics, he did offer a withering assessment of the effects of the tariffs. while uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth, powell said. trump nominated powell to lead the central bank in 2018, and powell earned such plaudits for the way he handled the economic fallout from the covid-19 pandemic that joe biden renominated him. but just before powell made his remarks, trump sent a message to the chairman via truth social. he is always late, but he could now change his image, and quickly, trump said on his social media platform. energy prices are down, interest rates are down, inflation is down, even eggs are down 69, and jobs are up, all within two months a big win for america. cut interest rates, jerome, and stop playing politics! trumps decision to wage a trade war came at a point that forced maximum pain for republicans and when his domestic agenda hangs in the balance. republicans historically have not liked tariffs and have supported free trade as part of their larger ideology that barriers to business stifle competition and kill jobs. trumps style of nationalism refuted that position, and his first speech as president denounced free trade deals. now republicans find themselves in a difficult place when they might need to defy trump for political and policy reasons. on wednesday, iowa senator chuck grassley, the senior-most republican, told the independent before trumps announcement that he worried the tariffs would drive up the cost of potash, which farmers use to grow soybeans and corn. that evening, four republicans lisa murkowski of alaska, susan collins of maine and kentuckys rand paul and mitch mcconnell- joined the democrats to pass legislation that would roll back trumps tariffs on canada. by thursday, grassley announced that he and democratic senator maria cantwell of washington would co-sponsor legislation that would require a president to explain the rationale and effects of new tariffs. the bill would also mandate that any new tariffs would expire without the approval of congress. grassley is not the only one sweating the effects of tariffs. senator ted cruz of texas, an archconservative who hails from a state that shares a border with mexico, warned on his podcast that the tariffs will raise the cost of automobiles immensely. its not just foreign cars that will go up all the american cars, their prices are going to go up, too, he said, adding that a manufacturer from one of the major automobile companies in the united states told him that by june, the price of american-made cars would jump by 4,500. all the while, republicans in the senate are hoping to begin the heavy lifting of passing trumps agenda. later on friday evening, the senate will begin a vote-a-rama for amendments to pass a budget resolution that would allow them to begin negotiating the details of the one, big, beautiful bill to drive through trumps domestic policy agenda. that would only be the beginning of the senates problems though. the committee for a responsible federal budget flagged that the proposed legislation would add almost 6 trillion to the debt with only a pittance of spending cuts. this will likely infuriate house republicans, whose budget resolution calls for 4.5 trillion in tax cuts only if the house finds 2 trillion worth of spending cuts. democrats have said that the 880 billion worth of spending cuts that the house energy and commerce committee needs to find would come out of medicaid. all of this comes as trumps proposed tariffs will eat away at americans wallets, and while their retirement savings get crushed in the stock market. as trumps approval rating continues to take a hit, republicans will feel a continued sense of urgency to pass his agenda, but that would make it even more politically unpopular. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: S&P 500 nears bear market, as highest tariffs in a century threaten trade
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-08 22:57:16)
  Content: the stock market staged a brief rally tuesday on hopes that president donald trump would turn from raising tariffs to cutting deals, before sinking amid renewed tough talk by administration officials. the sp 500 index closed down 1.5 percent, bringing its total loss since the mid-february start of trumps trade offensive to almost 20 percent, the official indication of a bear market. stocks jumped nearly 4 percent in the first hour of trading, after treasury secretary scott bessent told cnbc that nearly 70 countries had approached the united states about negotiating over trade barriers. the next escalation of u.s. tariffs was just hours away. but the president fueled the upbeat mood with a subsequent social media post, describing a great call with south koreas acting president about a potential bargain. yet the market rebound soon fizzled. on capitol hill, some of the presidents top aides sought to clarify the trade wars murky parameters. jamieson greer, the presidents chief trade negotiator, described the nations 1.2 trillion trade deficit as an emergency that required urgent efforts to reshape the u.s. economy. greer brushed aside lawmakers complaints about potential costs to consumers and businesses, telling the senate finance committee, the president is fixed in his purpose. bessent, meanwhile, sought to calm republican fears that trumps bare-knuckled assault on the global trading system might trigger a politically lethal recession. during an hour-long meeting hosted by house majority whip tom emmer r-minnesota, bessent briefed lawmakers and jay timmons, the head of the national association of manufacturers, on the administrations plans for a manufacturing revival. one week after trumps announcement of the highest import taxes in more than a century, investors, companies and lawmakers continue trying to make sense of his ultimate goal. for now, the administration says the president is advancing on twin tracks raising tariffs to encourage manufacturers to return to the united states, while fielding offers by other nations to lower their barriers to u.s. products. despite swelling criticism from lawmakers and chief executives, the administration appears vindicated by the eagerness of foreign leaders hoping to avert u.s. tariffs by making a deal with trump. in her daily briefing for reporters, white house press secretary karoline leavitt struck a combative tone. america does not need other countries as much as other countries need us, she said. the presidents high-risk strategy is already paying off, according to greer, who cited recent investment announcements by automakers and other manufacturers planning to expand their u.s. operations. likewise, officials from argentina, vietnam and israel have indicated they will drop their tariff and regulatory barriers to u.s. exports. greer and other administration officials are engaged in talks with countries such as japan and south korea. but there is no immediate prospect of talks with the nation at the center of u.s. trade complaints china. after china imposed a 34 percent tariff on u.s. goods, in retaliation for trumps april 2 announcement, the president added an additional 50 percent tax on top of his earlier moves. as of 1201 a.m. wednesday, american importers of some chinese products will pay a tax of up to 129 percent. greer said the administration was disappointed with chinas failure to comply with the 2020 phase one trade deal trump signed in his first term, which committed beijing to make substantial purchases of u.s. farm, energy and manufactured goods. amid the disruption of the pandemic, which erupted within weeks of the white house signing ceremony for the deal, china fell short of its commercial promises. after trump said he would impose the additional 50 percent tariff, chinas commerce ministry called the presidents move a mistake on top of a mistake. if the united states waged a trade war against china, it would fight to the end, the ministry said. administration official say they have the advantage over chinese president xi jinping, since americans buy roughly three times as much from china as the chinese buy from u.s. companies. trump said china panicked in opting to retaliate for his tariffs. the president believes that xi and china want to make a deal. they just dont know how to get that started, leavitt told reporters. the administrations unruly nature, however, is shadowing the presidents policy aims. growing acrimony between elon musk, the worlds richest man, and peter navarro, a white house trade adviser, spilled into public view in recent days. after navarro disparaged musk during a cnbc interview as a car assembler rather than a manufacturer, the tesla ceo savaged the former university professor in posts on x as dumber than a sack of bricks and peter retarrdo. peter retarrdo elon musk elonmusk april 8, 2025 the extraordinary display was praised by leavitt as evidence of the administrations transparency. boys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue, she said. greers congressional testimony offered additional details of trumps plan. asked by several senators whether american businesses would win exclusions from the tariffs to continue importing products that they could not obtain from domestic suppliers, greer said no. the president does not intend to have exclusions, he said, adding that granting them would undermine the planned economic restructuring. were trying to remedy a situation thats persisted for many years. though quick to praise the presidents goals, republicans on the finance committee repeatedly voiced worry over the short-term economic costs. sen. james lankford r-oklahoma told greer a constituent had relocated his supply chain from china to vietnam in response to the presidents first-term trade policy only to find that he would now be paying a new 46 percent tariff on vietnamese products. cattle ranchers in montana were distressed by a 92 percent decline in chinese purchases of u.s. beef last month, as the trade war intensified, according to sen. steve daines r-montana. and sen. thom tillis r-north carolina pronounced himself skeptical that the administration could wage a trade war against dozens of countries simultaneously. this is creating some anxiety, said sen. todd young r-indiana. some big-name tech stocks with notable morning gains joined the broader market in retreating, with alphabet, amazon, apple and tesla in negative territory tuesday afternoon. stock analysts characterized tuesday mornings rally as a natural reaction after weeks of declines, capped by the harshest three-day sell-off in years. with tariff negotiations beginning, markets may be an important step closer to finding an equilibrium, mark zabicki, chief investment officer at lpl financial, wrote in a tuesday research note. some asian and european markets recovered tuesday despite the chinese threats of trade war escalation. germanys dax gained about 2.5 percent, and londons ftse 100 climbed 3.3 percent. japans nikkei 225 jumped 6 percent, while hong kongs hang seng index and indias sensex were both up 1.5 percent.

  Title: World braces for 'Liberation Day' as Trump set to reveal sweeping tariffs
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-02 10:00:13)
  Content: markets and foreign capitals have braced themselves for a broad set of tariffs from president trump on wednesday, anxious for details on a dramatic shift in u.s. trade policy that is expected to supercharge the costs of cars, houses and everyday goods for americans. it is unclear whether the trump administration plans to impose a universal, baseline rate for import taxes on trading partners, or to customize tariff policy to each foreign nation, imposing reciprocal rates on a case-by-case basis. it is also unclear whether there will be any exceptions. a white house official told the times that exact details of the plan are still being perfected. the lack of clarity has rattled markets in recent weeks, driving the worst first annual quarter in three years and erasing gains on the standard poors 500 index made since trumps election victory in november. the white house said trump would announce his plans at 1 p.m. pacific time on wednesday, precisely when closing bells ring on wall street. after that, the new policy will be effective immediately, white house press secretary karoline leavitt told reporters at a tuesday news briefing. costs could rise immediately on perishable goods caught in limbo at international ports, including avocados and pineapples, said sung won sohn, a former commissioner at the port of los angeles. prices on larger items with dwindling inventories, such as foreign cars and washing machines, are likely to rise within weeks. lumber is stacked outside at the milan lumber co. in milan, n.h. robert f. bukaty associated press for los angeles, in particular, the tariffs are coming at a very bad time, sohn said. were in kind of bad shape, because you need a lot of lumber to rebuild from the fires, and the construction hasnt started yet. itll probably start in three to four months, and thats exactly when were going to be hit by higher prices for lumber. top european union leaders have alluded to potent retaliation that could extend beyond american whiskey and hit directly at silicon valley, core to the u.s. and californian economy. and californias agricultural economy the nations largest could become a target as well. retaliatory tariffs are expected to come from nations across the world affected by the new rates, risking further response from the trump administration, thus prompting a spiral into a trade war with few winners. leaders in canada, the second largest u.s. trading partner, have said ottawa will react swiftly to any new tariff actions. but mexican president claudia sheinbaum suggested tuesday that her administration will not retaliate immediately if washington slaps new taxes on mexican imports. we dont believe in an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, because that always leads to a bad situation, sheinbaum told journalists at her daily news conference. mexican president claudia sheinbaum addresses supporters at a march 9, 2025, rally at the zocalo, mexico citys main square. eduardo verdugo associated press instead, she called for further negotiations with the u.s., even while acknowledging that she has no plans to speak to trump in the coming days. the dialogue must continue, sheinbaum said. its not a matter of you put that, so ill put that, but rather whats best for mexico. shorter-term pain trumps advisors say the new policy will bring about an overdue correction, returning fair trade practices, ultimately raising significant revenue for the federal government and bringing back manufacturing to u.s. shores. it is, in many ways, the culmination of a years-long campaign by trump to increase tariffs going back to the 1980s, when as a real estate developer and celebrity, he accused japan and china of laughing at and ripping off the united states. in his address to a joint session of congress on march 4, trump complained that countries across the globe place tariffs on u.s.-made goods. on average, the european union, china, brazil, india, mexico, and canada have you heard of them? and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. its very unfair, he said. in his first term, trump negotiated a detailed trade deal, the united states-mexico-canada agreement, that replaced the north american free trade agreement and governed trade practices among the united states and its closest trading partners. susano cordoba sells peanuts to truck drivers lining up in tijuana to cross the border into the united states on march 4, 2025. gregory bull associated press but since resuming office in january, trump has repeatedly threatened new rounds of tariffs on mexican and canadian goods, often retreating from his plans at the last moment. the on-again, off-again threat of tariffs have contributed to the instability jolting stock markets, which closed on tuesday slightly up after a day of volatile trading. allies of the white house have acknowledged that short-term pain can be expected for u.s. households in the wake of the new policy implementation, which trump has referred to as liberation day. theres absolutely going to be short-term pain, republican sen. tim sheehy of montana told cnn on monday. the presidents been clear about that. everyone has. if youre going to remodel your house to make it better in the end, its going to be really annoying in the short term, when your house is getting remodeled and theres drywall dust everywhere and theres workers in your living room, sheehy added. the reality is that remodels got to happen in order to make things stronger and more stable in the back end. already, american consumers have begun to cut back on their spending and boost their savings. a friday report from the bureau of economic analysis , a government agency, showed that the personal savings rate rose 4.6 in february. consumer spending increased just .4, after decreasing by .3 in january. leavitt added tuesday that many countries have been calling the president, asking for relief from the anticipated tariffs. she said the president is open to taking their calls. its simple if you make your product in america, you will pay no tariffs, leavitt said. it is unclear how the administration will measure the success of the new tariffs. leavitt called the stock market, which has experienced volatility in recent weeks over tariff turmoil, a snapshot in time. the white house has repeatedly pointed to companies that have newly invested in the u.s. since trump took office as evidence of tariffs working. a pause on other 25 tariffs against canada and mexico is also set to expire tuesday, and the white house would not confirm whether it would be lifted. trumps announcement comes the same day that 25 tariffs were set to take effect on auto imports at 1201 a.m. wednesday. times staff writer kate linthicum in mexico city contributed to this report.

  Title: Trump Advisers Say 50-Plus Countries Have Reached Out for Tariff Talks With White House
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-06 18:32:26)
  Content: fort lauderdale, fla. ap top administration officials said sunday that more than 50 countries targeted by president donald trumps new tariffs have reached out to begin negotiations over the sweeping import taxes that have sent financial markets reeling, raised fears of a recession and upended the global trading system. the higher rates are set to be collected beginning wednesday, ushering in a new era of economic uncertainty with no clear end in sight. treasury secretary scott bessent said unfair trade practices are not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks. the united states, he said, must see what the countries offer and whether its believable. trump, who spent the weekend in florida playing golf, posted online that we will win. hang tough, it wont be easy. his cabinet members and economic advisers were out in force sunday defending the tariffs and downplaying the consequences for the global economy. there doesnt have to be a recession. who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week? bessent said. what we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity. trumps tariff blitz, announced april 2, fulfilled a key campaign promise as he acted without congress to redraw the rules of global trade. it was a move decades in the making for trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the u.s. he is gambling that voters will be willing to endure higher prices for everyday items to enact his economic vision. countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with china and others retaliating quickly. top white house economic adviser kevin hassett acknowledged that other countries are angry and retaliating, and, he said, by the way, coming to the table. he cited the office of the u.s. trade representative as reporting that more than 50 nations had reached out to the white house to begin talks. adding to the turmoil, the new tariffs are hitting american allies and adversaries alike, including israel, which is facing a 17 tariff. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is set to visit the white house monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion with trump along with the war in gaza and other issues. another american ally, vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs. trump said vietnams leader said in a telephone call that his country wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s. and a key european partner, italian premier giorgia meloni, said she disagreed with trumps move but was ready to deploy all the tools negotiating and economic necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized. commerce secretary howard lutnick made clear there was no postponing tariffs that are days away. the tariffs are coming. of course they, he said, adding that trump needed to reset global trade. but he committed only to having them definitely remain for days and weeks. in congress, where trumps republican party has long championed free trade, the tariff regiment has been met with applause but also significant unease. several republican senators have already signed onto a new bipartisan bill that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to congress. lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. wyomings john barrasso, the no. 2 member of the senates gop leadership, said trump is doing what he has every right to do. but, he acknowledged, there is concern, and theres concern across the country. people are watching the markets. therell be a discussion in the senate, barrasso said of the tariffs. well see which way the discussion goes. trumps government cost-cutting guru, billionaire businessman elon musk, had been relatively silent on trumps tariffs, but said at a weekend event in italy that he would like to see the u.s. and europe move to a zero-tariff situation. the comment from the tesla owner who leads trumps department of government efficiency drew a rebuke from white house trade adviser peter navarro. elon, when he is on his doge lane, is great. but we understand whats going on here. we just have to understand. elon sells cars, navarro said. he added hes simply protecting his own interest as any business person would do. lawrence summers, an economist who was treasury secretary under democratic president bill clinton, said trump and his economic team are sending contradictory messages if they say they are interested in reviving manufacturing while still being open to negotiating with trade partners. if other countries eliminate their tariffs, and the u.s, does, too, he said, its just making a deal, then we dont raise any revenue nor do we get any businesses to relocate to the united states. if its a permanent revenue source and trying to get businesses to relocate to the united states, then were going to have these tariffs permanently. so the president cant have it both ways. bessent was on nbcs meet the press, hassett and summers appeared on abcs this week, lutnick and barrasso were on cbs face the nation and navarro was interviewed on fox news channels sunday morning futures. ______ associated press writers giada zampano in rome and fatima hussein in jupiter, florida, contributed to this report. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: Executives, Trade and Labour Associations on Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-03 09:34:17)
  Content: reuters -u.s. president donald trump said on wednesday he would impose a 10 baseline tariff on all imports to the united states and higher duties on some of the countrys biggest trading partners, a move that could escalate a trade war and upend the global economy. here are latest reactions from company executives, trade and labour associations companies on holding weve taken note of the announced tariffs and are constantly monitoring the evolving situation and continuing policy changes. our global value and supply chain are well-positioned. germanys fresenius we . strongly support pharmaceuticals not being included in the reciprocal tariff proposal, as a blanket tariff would potentially risk shortages of essential medicines for american patients. steel group aperam regarding the limited volumes we export from the eu to the u.s., we will explore on a case by case basis the feasibility of relocating some of our production. unfortunately, the current lack of regulatory predictability creates an unfavorable business environment on both sides of the atlantic. stellantis the carmaker said it would temporarily pause production at some of its canadian and mexican assembly plants, such as its windsor assembly plant in canada. antonio baravalle, ceo, lavazza we had already planned to increase local production in the u.s. to 100. we are ready to go . but now there is this other element that is to be investigated, the duties for brasil . if they put a 10 duty on brazil, the duty of 20 is somehow already halved. the coffee maker currently produces around 50 of what it sells in the u.s. locally. ferrari purchase contracts for ferraris have clear and standard clauses allowing the company to adjust prices in case trade conditions change before the vehicles delivery. new tariffs will also apply to ferrari cars ordered months ago but not yet delivered to the u.s., a company spokesperson said. motofumi shitara, ceo, yamaha motor our exports would certainly be impacted. if these tariffs continue long-term, including for vehicles, we will need to respond by raising prices or reducing costs. maersk we generally expect customers to be a bit more cautious about their inventory levels. in the very short term, were likely to see some rush air freight orders in the u.s. ahead of the announced tariffs going into effect. it is also likely we will see an increase in demand for bonded storage as customers will want to hold off clearing goods while they get more certainty. gerresheimer the tariffs primarily affect our exports from our plant in mexico to the u.s. these include injection vials, for example . we will pass these customs duties on to our clients as additional costs. if necessary and if the customs duties are to remain in place in the longer term, we will also be able to relocate capacities. massimo battaini, ceo, prysmian on first reaction, the announcement appears to have a positive impact on local production. the tariffs will be applied to finished products, and therefore removes the risk that u.s. production could have been undercut from abroad. anders vindegg, head of media relations, hydro we are working actively both from norway and in the eu in brussels to inform and to work actively with the organisations and other measures that were a part of to leverage the importance of norwegian aluminium to europe. associations ipc, a global association for electronics manufacturing we welcome president trumps commitment to strengthening american manufacturing, particularly his focus on revitalizing the defense industrial base. tariffs will not achieve this goal.trade is essential to supply-chain resilience, innovation, and cost competitiveness. without it, tariffs risk raising costs for american businesses and further driving production offshore. retail industry leaders association the presidents plan is not a targeted attempt to protect american innovation or national security but will hit every familys budget. these newly announced tariffs and the expected retaliatory tariffs on american businesses risk destabilizing the u.s. economy, undermining the goals of bolstering domestic manufacturing and growth. european retail industry body eurocommerce eurocommerce calls on eu and u.s. administrations to engage in constructive dialogue. if negotiations fail, the eu has a legal basis to respond to unfair trading practices by third countries. with the anti-coercion instrument, the eu has an extensive toolbox which could help address the situation. international apparel federation the u.s. governments announcement of heavy taxes on its trade with the rest of the world is a major shock to our global apparel industry. it unnecessarily creates a new and often irrational reality affecting billions of dollars of investments and the lives of tens of millions of people working in our industry globally. ultimately, someone will have to pay the price. canadian steel association to reduce our dependency, the canadian steel industry urgently requires the adoption of strict border measures that address unfair steel trade in canada and helps to recapture the canadian market for our industry, our workers and our communities. spanish association of olive oil exporters the spanish olive oil sector is seriously disadvantaged by this 20, compared to 10 for other producing countries not belonging to the european union. 98 of olive oil consumed in the united states comes from imports, so these tariffs will result in a higher purchase price that will have to be borne by u.s. consumers. kevin craven, ceo, ads group, on aerospace components we are absolutely not clear whether that exemption from all tariffs on items that are classified as air worthy by regulators continues and whether these tariffs apply or not. so potentially that might make it more painful. eu farming group copa-cogeca the introduction of additional tariffs threatens to disrupt global supply chains, drive up prices, and limit market access for farmers and agri-cooperatives on both sides of the atlantic, with significant economic consequences for the agricultural sector. anthony brun, head of french cognac growers association ugvc one could have feared much higher tariffs, but this risk is not off the table and remains with a potential conflict over bourbon whiskey. we already face tariffs in china, now there are the u.s., and the consequences will be very brutal to wine growers. sigrid de vries, director general, european automobile manufacturers association we urge our leaders to meet urgently so that they can find a solution to any issues preventing free and fair trade between historic allies and allow the eu-us relationship to flourish once again. swiss business group economiesuisse a further escalation of the trade conflict must be prevented. the federal council and swiss economic diplomacy are called upon to quickly find solutions at the negotiating table with the u.s. government. from an economic perspective, there are no comprehensible reasons for u.s. tariffs against switzerland quite the opposite. dirk jandura, head of germanys exporters association bga we will have to pass these tariffs on as price increases, and that will hit turnover in many cases . this is an economic blind alley at whose end lie welfare losses for both sides of the atlantic. reporting by reuters bureax, compiled by mrinalika roy, greta rosen fondahn, linda pasquini and alessandro parodi editing by alan barona, milla nissi and bernadette baum 2025

wall street, the nasdaq broke a record with its largest single-day point drop in the markets 50-year history as investors responded to president donald trumps tariff plan. both the nasdaq and dow jones suffered their worst days since march 2020 amid the covid-19 pandemic. the dow fell 1,679 points, which ranks in the top five for most points lost in a single day. the nasdaq fell 1,050 points for its largest one-day drop. the drop happened as investors got spooked over the potential impact from president donald trumps tariff plan and fears it could spark a global trade war. trump has said the policy is necessary to level the playing field for american manufacturers. however, many economists have warned his plan could have a negative impact on the economy as tariffs are expected to raise prices. despite thursdays historically bad day, some analysts believed it could have been worse. markets may actually be underreacting, especially if these rates turn out to be final, given the potential knock-on effects to global consumption and trade, sean sun, portfolio manager at thornburg investment management, told the associated press. but trump remained confident. the markets are going to boom, the president predicted outside the white house thursday. the country is going to boom. against the backdrop of sliding markets thursday, white house officials defended the new tariffs. today, the world starts taking us seriously. our workforce will finally be treated fairly, commerce secretary howard lutnick said in a statement. hours earlier he told cnn the world should stop exploiting the united states. treasury secretary scott bessent issued a statement the presidents historic actions will level the playing field for american workers and usher in a new age of economic strength. but former treasury secretary under bill clinton, larry h. summers, said he would have left his post if such a plan was unveiled. if any administration of which i was a part had launched an economic policy so totally ungrounded in serious analysis or so dangerous and damaging, i would have resigned in protest, he wrote thursday on x. while announcing his sweeping plan, trump vowed to usher in a golden age for america. but thursdays stock market lacked any of that luster. major companies including restaurant chains, retailers, and tech giants that rely on products from around the globe saw their stocks decline as they brace for supply chain disruptions. starbucks ended the day down 11 percent while chipotle fell nearly 4 percent. shares gap tanked 20 percent and macys dropped almost 14 percent. apple plunged more than 9 percent while amazon dipped nearly the same amount. some automakers also endured a rough day as trumps 25 percent tariff on imported cars took effect. tesla stock dropped almost 6 percent and stellantis, parent company of jeep, chrysler, and dodge, slid nearly 10 percent. stellantis announced thursday it was halting production at its factories in mexico and canada. about 900 u.s. employees are expected to be laid off, the automaker said thursday. meanwhile, investors seemed to have found some solace in comfort foods. french fry producer lamb weston gained 10 percent while general mills, coca-cola and kraft heinz each gained nearly 3 percent. thursdays market plunge didnt seem to ease fears that trumps liberation day could dwindle retirement funds tied to the stock markets. georgia taylor, founder of tailored wealth, told the financial times those near retirement must monitor their pensions closely. withdrawing during market downturns can deplete funds faster, so seeking advice on a flexible withdrawal strategy is crucial. this highlights the growing need for financial planning to make pensions last longer. the effect on the retirement savings will depend on the years a person has left until retirement, maggie switek, senior director on the research team at the milken institute, told the independent. for young adults, with a longer time horizon left until retirement, the effects may be offset by future changes in the market, with the stock markets trending upward over longer periods of time. hedge fund manager bradley wickens predicted thursday was just the beginning of a long road ahead for the fallout of trumps tariff plan. he told the wall street journal the true nature of how negative this is is going to take time to manifest itself during april and may, as it all dawns on everyone that, wow, these tariffs are here for a long time. the final impact of trumps plan is still to be determined as companies and other countries determine their response. european commission president ursula von der leyen called trumps decision a major blow to the global economy, adding we are now preparing for further countermeasures, to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail. canadian prime minister mark carney announced that his country plans to match the u.s.s 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles we take these measures reluctantly. and we take them in ways that is intended and will cause maximum impact in the united states and minimum impact in canada. in the face of tariff panic and market turbulence, asked how he thought things were going, trump replied i think its going very well. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their

  Title: What to Know About the Trump Tariffs Upending Global Trade and Markets
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-03 19:28:49)
  Content: washington ap the trade war president donald trump promised has begun, threatening the world economy and straining the united states longstanding alliances in europe and asia. goods imported from dozens of countries and territories are now going to be taxed at sharply higher rates, and that is expected to drive up the costs of everything from cars to clothes to computers. these tariffs which can run as high as 50 - are meant to punish countries for trade barriers that trump says unfairly limit u.s. exports and cause it to run huge trade deficits. even countries with which the u.s. enjoys trade surpluses meaning it sells to them more than it buys, such as the united kingdom and argentina are being targeted with a minimum tariff of 10. and the highest tariffs are landing on two tiny territories that trade little with america the african kingdom of lesotho and the french possession of saint pierre and miquelon off canadas atlantic coast. for decades, global commerce abided by tariff rates agreed to by the u.s. and 122 other countries during the 1980s and 1990s. on wednesday, trump detonated that arrangement, saying that other countries had exploited the system and ripped off the united states for years, causing its once-mighty manufacturing base to shrink. our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered, the president said in the rose garden. global financial markets recoiled on thursday. on wall street, the dow jones industrial average dropped 1,679 points, or nearly 4, and the u.s. dollar fell against other major currencies a sign that investors are worried about the u.s. economy. this is a game changer, not only for the u.s. economy but for the global economy, said olu sonola, head of u.s. economic research for fitch ratings. many countries will likely end up in a recession. you can throw most forecasts out the door, if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time. trump is doing what he said hed do during the presidential campaign, trump repeatedly talked about imposing a universal tariff of 10 to 20 on all imports - and the new 10 baseline tariffs fit the description. he also threatened to hit imports from china with 60 tariffs, and hes now slapping a reciprocal tariff of 34 on china on top of the 20 levies hed announced earlier this year. combine the new tariffs on china with the ones left over from his first term, and from president joe bidens, and the full tax on chinese goods will now approach 70, said julian evans-pritchard of capital economics. its extreme, but it aligns with what trump campaigned on, said erica york, vice president of federal tax policy at the tax foundation. nobody knows if the tariffs will prove permanent or if the u.s. will lower or drop them in response to other countries negotiating to reduce their own tariffs and other trade barriers. u.s. tariff rates are going back more than 100 years even before wednesdays bombshell, the president had been lobbing tariffs with abandon in his second term. he restored 25 tariffs from his first term on steel and aluminum, imposed 25 levies on cars and light trucks, hit china with 20 import taxes and levied 25 tariffs on some canadian and mexican imports. the budget lab at yale university estimates that his 2025 tariffs including wednesdays would lift americas effective average tariff rate to 22.5. that would be up from 2.5 last year and the highest level since 1909 even higher than the notorious smoot-hawley tariffs that congress passed during the great depression. before lawmakers ratified the 16th amendment to the constitution in 1913, introducing a national income tax, tariffs supplied a big share of the federal governments revenue more than 90 at times in the mid-1800s. the u.s. moved from tariffs to income taxes to raise more money to finance an expanding government, collect more revenue from the wealthy and make the economy more efficient by reducing trade barriers and encouraging competition. trump wants to return to those days and replace income tax collections with tariffs. last year, tariffs accounted for less than 2 of federal revenue, while 51 came from the income tax and 36 from social security and medicare taxes. tariffs are likely to damage the u.s. and world economies the yale budget lab estimates that trumps 2025 tariffs will increase u.s. consumer prices by 2.3 in the short run, costing american households 3,800 a year. the tariffs he announced on liberation day alone will push up prices by 1.3, the lab calculates a 2,100 tax on households. clothing prices will go up 17 as higher import tariffs hit textiles from southeast asia and bangladesh. the lab says that trumps tariffs will reduce u.s. economic growth which was 2.8 in 2024 - by 0.9 percentage points this year. the damage will also extend to europe, southeast asia and china. we can expect global economic growth to start plummeting as trade flows decline, prices increase and businesses put off investments, said wendy cutler, a former u.s. trade official who is now vice president at the asia society policy institute. trump hits allies and poor countries between the so-called reciprocal and baseline tariffs, trump hit allies and adversaries, rich and poor countries, and those open and closed to u.s. exports. even singapore, perhaps the freest-trading economy in the world, is getting slugged with the 10 levies, belying trumps claims to be balancing other countries protectionist policies, said scott lincicome, a trade analyst with the libertarian cato institute. this is not reciprocal at all, lincicome said. getting to real numbers on foreign trade barriers and their effects on u.s. trade numbers would require lengthy investigations and would take months, if not years, to produce. . they might as well have pulled the numbers out of a hat. taiwan, a u.s. ally, faces a 32 tariff, not much less than geopolitical rival chinas 34. poor countries also bore the brunt of some of trumps most onerous tariffs. lesotho, a tiny country surrounded by south africa, is facing a 50 reciprocal tariff, for example, even though its annual economic output per person is less than 2,900 compared to americas 76,200. cambodia, whose annual economic output per person is about 7,200, is absorbing a 49 tariff. that is partly, the white house says, because it has been a conduit for chinese-made goods eventually headed to the united states to dodge u.s. tariffs on china. canada and mexico got off relatively easy trumps trade policies toward americas northern and southern neighbors have been erratic. he has twice announced and then suspended or watered down 25 tariffs on canadian and mexican goods, ostensibly to get them to do more than crack down on fentanyl and immigrants crossing into the u.s. illegally. last month, trump suspended the 25 duties on canadian and mexican goods that comply with the us-mexico canada agreement, a trade pact he negotiated with the two countries in his first term. on wednesday, the white house said that usmca-compliant imports could continue to enter the united states duty free. once the two countries have satisfied trumps demands on immigration and drug trafficking, the tariff on the rest of their imports would drop from 25 to 12, the white house said. the obvious winners were canada and mexico, neil shearing and paul ashworth of capital economics wrote in a commentary. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: Dow Jones plunges more than 1,600 points as stock market recoils from Trump tariff shock - CBS News
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-04 11:08:26)
  Content: updated on april 4, 2025 708 am edt cbs news stocks cratered in the u.s. on thursday as anxious investors tried to assess the potential economic impact of the latest round of trump administration tariffs. the dow jones industrial average plunged 1,679 points, or 4, to close at 40,546. the sp 500 sank 274 points, or 4.8, its biggest one-day drop since covid-19 torpedoed financial markets in 2020. that amounts to a loss of roughly 2 trillion, according to data from factset. the tech-heavy nasdaq also suffered its worst session since the pandemic, dropping more than 1,050 points, or nearly 6. that nosedive reflects investor concerns about how steep tariffs on china, taiwan, vietnam and other manufacturing hubs could impact technology companies, analysts said. futures trading overnight pointed to more deep declines at the opening. as of 645 a.m. edt, the dow was down a whopping 1.053 points, the sp 142 points and the nasdaq 531.50 points, according to bloomberg. asian stocks fell further friday, though markets in shanghai, taiwan, hong kong and indonesia were closed for holidays, limiting the extent of the days declines, the associated press reported. tokyos nikkei 225 lost 2.8 while south koreas kospi sank 0.9. european markets lost more ground, the ap said. germanys dax fell 2. the cac 40 in paris was off 1.6. and britains ftse 100 declined 1.7. shares of apple, which has diversified its international supply chains in recent years but which still makes most of its iphones in china, dropped nearly 10 thursday. the new duties raise the nominal u.s. tariff rate on china to 54. investor psychology has been destroyed, and dip buyers are nowhere to be seen, equity analyst adam crisafulli, head of vital knowledge, said in a research note. all the efforts to spin recent events positively are increasingly falling flat. highlighting the extent of the losses nearly every major industrial sector suffered declines, with tech players, banks, retailers, apparel makers and airlines among the hardest hit. best buy shares sank roughly 18, united airlines fell 16 and nike slid 16, while even ai powerhouse nvidia saw its stock drop nearly 8. president trump on wednesday announced a 10 baseline tariff on all u.s. trading partners and increased levies on dozens of countries that charge higher taxes on american exports. mr. trump has said the goal is to make global commerce more fair, spur companies to expand in the u.s. and generate federal revenue. experts warn that sharply ramping up tariffs on imports, coupled with any retaliatory measures from other nations, could drive up inflation, dampen spending by consumers and businesses, and hurt economic growth. market uncertainty is likely to remain elevated in the weeks ahead, as investors consider likely downgrades to consensus u.s. economic and earnings growth forecasts, the risk of a tit-for-tat escalation in tariffs and the potential scope for tariffs announced to be negotiated down, solita marcelli, chief investment officer americas at ubs global wealth management, said in a note to investors. appearing on cnn thursday, white house press secretary karoline leavitt expressed confidence that the trump administrations economic policies would pay off. commenting on global financial markets sliding overnight, she said, to anyone on wall street this morning, i would say trust in president trump. financial markets surged after mr. trump was re-elected in november, with wall street counting on lower taxes and deregulation to fuel corporate profits. other investors bet on the trump administration threatening tariffs mostly as a way to pressure other countries into making concessions on trade, rather than a full-fledged push to change the terms of global commerce. but after hitting all-time highs in february, stocks have turned tail as the white house makes clear it wasnt bluffing. indeed, investors have been left stunned by the speed and scale of mr. trumps tariffs. in contrast to his first term, when he implemented levies on roughly 380 billion worth of goods over four years, mr. trump has imposed more than 3 trillion in tariffs in the less than three months since his return to power, according to the economic policy institute, a left-leaning think tank. markets may actually be underreacting, especially if these rates turn out to be final, given the potential knock-on effects to global consumption and trade, said sean sun, portfolio manager at thornburg investment management. including its thursday dive, the sp 500 is now down 8.2 this year, the dow has sunk 4.7 and the nasdaq has tumbled 14.3. despite the angst on wall street, economists note that the u.s. continues to grow, and most still put relatively low odds on a recession. hiring around the u.s. also remains healthy, with the nations unemployment rate hovering around 4. for borrowers, meanwhile, further signs the economy is at risk of stalling could encourage the federal reserve to lower its benchmark interest rate. the central bank last cut rates in december of 2024, but has kept them steady since then as policy makers seek to douse inflation. the

  Title: Trump threatens more tariffs on China as global markets shudder over how much pain economy can take
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-10 20:33:10)
  Content: follow live updates on the global markets washington ap undeterred by a panicked stock market, president donald trump threatened additional tariffs on china on monday, raising fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war. trumps threat came after china said it would retaliate against u.s. tariffs he announced last week. if china does not withdraw its 34 increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, april 8th, 2025, the united states will impose additional tariffs on china of 50, effective april 9th, trump wrote on truth social. additionally, all talks with china concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! the u.s. president has shown few signs of backing down on tariffs despite the mounting pressure in the financial markets. his commitment to tariffs could have devastating effects for the global economy, even though trump is banking that it will ultimately pay off with manufacturing jobs. asked monday if he would consider a pause on his widespread tariffs, trump said, were not looking at that. the u.s. president said he was open to negotiations if we can make a really fair deal and a good deal for the united states. trump added that its possible to have both negotiated settlements with other countries and permanent tariffs. even as israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said his country would take its tariffs against u.s. goods to zero, trump was noncommittal about removing the new import taxes placed on an ally. the white house also said monday that trump would veto a senate bill that would mandate congressional approval for new tariffs, a bet that the critical mass of republican lawmakers will loyally back him despite the economic and political risks. however, there are signs of frustration even among trumps allies. sen. john kennedy, a louisiana republican, said he supports the presidents goals of better trade deals but worries about the economic uncertainty. we dont know if the medicine will be worse than the disease, kennedy said, adding, this is president trumps economy now. if trump implements his new taxes on imports from china, u.s. tariffs on chinese goods would reach a combined 104. the new taxes would be on top of the 20 tariffs announced as punishment for fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34 tariffs announced last week. not only could that increase prices for american consumers, it could also give china an incentive to flood other countries with cheaper goods and seek deeper relationships with other trading partners. china responded angrily and said it would not back down. the u.s. threat to escalate tariffs on china is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the u.s., said a statement from the commerce ministry in beijing. china will never accept this. if the u.s. insists on its own way, china will fight to the end. after sell-offs on the prior two days of trading, the dow jones industrial average on monday fell 0.9. the sp 500 slumped 0.2, and the nasdaq composite was up 0.1. trump frequently bragged about stock market gains during his first term, and the threat of losses on wall street was viewed as a potential guardrail on risky economic policies in his second term. but that hasnt been the case, and trump has described days of financial pain as necessary. i dont mind going through it because i see a beautiful picture at the end, he said. trump officials have frequently appeared on television to make the case for his policies, but none of their explanations have calmed the markets. the only improvement came from a false report that top economic adviser kevin hassett said trump was considering a pause on all tariffs except for china. stock prices spiked before the white house denied it was true by calling the post fake news. the republican president has remained defiant despite fears that he could be pushing the u.s. toward a recession, insisting that his tariffs are necessary for rebuilding domestic manufacturing and resetting trade relationships with other countries. but his aggressive push has scrambled u.s. economic policy. even though inflation remains elevated, trump has called on the federal reserve to lower its benchmark interest rates that were increased to constrain price increases. federal reserve chair jerome powell warned friday that the tariffs could increase inflation, and he said, theres a lot of waiting and seeing going on, including by us, before any decisions would be made. european commission president ursula von der leyen said the european union would focus on trade with other countries besides the united states, saying there are vast opportunities elsewhere. trump said he spoke with japanese prime minister shigeru ishiba to start trade negotiations. he complained on truth social they have treated the u.s. very poorly on trade and they dont take our cars, but we take millions of theirs. ishiba said he told trump that hes strongly concerned that tariffs would discourage investment from japan, which has been the worlds biggest investor in the u.s. in the past five years. he described the situation as a national crisis and said his government would negotiate with washington to urge trump to reconsider the tariffs. white house trade adviser peter navarro suggested countries would need to do much more than simply lower their own tariff rates to reach deals, an indication that talks could be a drawn-out process. lets take vietnam, he said on cnbc. when they come to us and say, well go to zero tariffs, that means nothing to us because its the non-tariff cheating that matters. meeting with trump at the white house on monday, netanyahu said his country would remove tariffs and other trade barriers in response to the u.s. placing 17 taxes on imports from israel. israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same, netanyahu told the u.s. president. trump said he appreciated very much what netanyahu had said. but when asked if he would remove the tariffs, trump said maybe not because of the aid that the united states provides to israel. the u.s. had a 7.4 billion trade deficit in goods last year with israel, according to the census bureau. trump has strived for a united front after the chaotic infighting of his first term. however, the economic turbulence has exposed some fractures among his supporters. bill ackman, a hedge fund manager, assailed commerce secretary howard lutnick on sunday as indifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing. on monday, ackman apologized for his criticism claiming that lutnick, previously the head of the financial firm cantor fitzgerald, could benefit from the tariffs because of its bond investments. but the hedge fund manager also reiterated his concerns about trumps tariffs. i am just frustrated watching what i believe to be a major policy error occur after our country and the president have been making huge economic progress that is now at risk due to the tariffs, he wrote on x. billionaire elon musk, a top adviser to trump on overhauling the federal government, expressed skepticism about tariffs over the weekend. musk has said that tariffs would drive up costs for tesla, his electric automaker. i hope it is agreed that both europe and the united states should move ideally in my view to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between europe and north america, musk said in a video conference with italian politicians. navarro later told fox news sunday morning futures that musk doesnt understand the situation. he sells cars, navarro said. thats what he does. he added, hes simply protecting his own interests as any businessperson would do. ___ associated press writers didi tang and stephen groves in washington and mari yamaguchi in tokyo contributed to this report. ___ follow the aps coverage of

the patient lived, and is healing. the prognosis is that the patient will be far stronger, bigger, better, and more resilient than ever before. make america great again! as the markets declined, white house officials defended the tariffs. vice president jd vance told fox friends a lot of people have gotten rich from american companies moving overseas but american workers have not gotten rich and frankly american companies have not gotten wealthy from the increasing growth of foreign competitors manufacturing overseas. asked on cnn at what point the u.s. might consider backing off on tariffs, especially considering countries have already vowed to retaliate, commerce secretary howard lutnick said i dont think theres any chance trump is gonna back off his tariffs. this is the reordering of global trade. he added the world should stop exploiting the united states. stocks of large restaurant chains also slid thursday morning as their major imports are likely to be affected by the new levies, with starbucks falling nearly 7 percent and chipotle falling about 4 percent. retailers are also down as they brace for supply chain disruptions shares in lululemon and nike each dipped 12 percent thursday morning while gap tanked 21 percent and macys dropped 14 percent. american employees in the auto industry could also soon feel the impacts of the new tariffs as stellantis, which owns jeep, chrysler, and dodge, announced it was halting production at its factories in mexico and canada astrumps 25 percent tariff on imported cars starts. about 900 u.s. employees are expected to be laid off, the automaker said thursday. stellantis stock was down more than 7 percent thursday just before noon. investors are struggling to navigate trumps tariffs, sarah ketterer, chief executive and portfolio manager at causeway capital management, told the wall street journal. im bewildered, ketterer said. were sailing into some seriously uncharted waters. some americans fear that the reactions to the new tariffs are going to harm their retirement retirement savings and some experts warn they might. for the small investor, the decline in value will be devastating, particularly for retired baby boomers, peter ricchiuti, a professor at tulane universitys freeman school of business, told business insider. sen. adam schiff predicted that trumps liberation day tariffs will actually liberate americans from being able to afford groceries, much of their savings, and any hope of buying a home. leaders of the some of the u.s.s largest trading partners have said they are already preparing reciprocal tariffs. european commission president ursula von der leyen called trumps decision a major blow to the global economy, adding thursday we are now preparing for further countermeasures, to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail. germanys ecnomics minister robert habeck went so far as to rename trumps liberation day as inflation day. other world leaders have denounced the new levies, but vowed to work with the u.s. to avoid a trade war. the american economy and americans, whether businesses or citizens, will emerge weaker and poorer, french president emmanuel macron predicted thursday. but business leaders warn these levies will have deleterious impacts for american families. national association of manufacturers president and ceo jay timmons said in a statement on wednesday that trumps tariffs will threaten investment, jobs, supply chains, and, in turn, americas ability to outcompete other nations and lead as the preeminent manufacturing superpower. trump is going to war with countries on this, andrew brenner, head of international fixed income at national alliance securities, told the new york times. its ridiculous. it shows no comprehension as to what he is doing to other countries. and it is going to hurt the u.s. house democratic leader hakeem jeffries told meidastouch after trumps announcement the stock market is collapsing, and what that means is the retirement savings of everyday americans are disappearing by the hour. and this is all because of trumps reckless mismanagement of the economy and now, these tariffs that are being imposed are going to raise the cost of goods for everyday americans by some estimates, by thousands of dollars per year. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
