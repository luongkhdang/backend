  Title: Tariff turmoil: How Tesla and other companies are dealing with the uncertainty of the trade war
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-23 22:23:02)
  Content: new york ap uncertainty over tariffs and an unpredictable trade war is weighing heavily on companies as they report their latest financial results and try to give investors financial forecasts. some tariffs remain in place against key u.s. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. the tariff and trade picture has been shifting for months, sometimes changing drastically on a daily basis. those shifts make it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales. on tuesday, treasury secretary scott bessent said he expects a de-escalation in the trade war between the u.s. and china, but cautioned that talks between the two sides had yet to formally start. heres how several big companies are dealing with the tariff confusion tesla tesla is in a better position than most car companies to deal with tariffs because it makes most of its u.s. cars domestically. but it still sources materials from other nations and will face import taxes. the bigger impact will be seen in the companys energy business. the company said the impact will be outsized because it sources lfp battery cells from china. the broader trade war could also hurt the company as china, the worlds largest electric vehicle market, retaliates against the u.s. tesla was forced earlier this month to stop taking orders from mainland customers for two models, its model s and model x. it makes the model y and model 3 for the chinese market at its factory in shanghai. ceo elon musk, an adviser to president donald trump, on tuesday reiterated that he believes lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity. but he added that ultimately the president decides on what tariffs to impose. akzo nobel the amsterdam-based maker of paints and coatings for industrial and commercial use said the big risk from tariffs could come in the form of lower demand for its products. the company said almost all sales of finished goods in the u.s. were locally produced, with the majority of raw materials locally sourced. over the years, we deliberately localized both our procurement and production in the u.s., said ceo gregoire poux-guillaume, in a conference call with analysts. we also largely run china for china and use the rest of asia instead as an export base. the companys products range from paints and coatings for the automotive industry to the do-it-yourself homeowner. broader tariffs could squeeze consumers and businesses and hurt sales. boston scientific the medical device maker said it expects most of the effecs of tariffs to hit the company during the second half of the year, but that it can absorb the impact. the company raised its earnings and revenue forecasts for the year, despite the tariffs. it estimates a 200 million impact from tariffs in 2025, but said it can offset that through higher sales and reductions in discretionary spending. the company said it has a long-standing supply chain around the globe and has made significant investments in the u.s. boeing boeing said much of its supply chain is in the u.s. and many of its imports from canada and mexico are exempt from tariffs under an existing trade agreement. the company does have suppliers in japan and italy, but it expects to recover those tariff costs. the net annual cost of higher tariffs on the supply chain is less than 500 million. a bigger concern is the potential for retaliatory tariffs, which could impact its ability to deliver aircraft. china, a key target for u.s. tariffs, has retaliated in part by no longer accepting deliveries of boeing aircraft. att att, like its peers in the telecommunications sector, faces higher costs for cellphones and other equipment. the company said it believes it can manage anticipated higher costs, based on the current pause in some tariffs and its supply chain. the magnitude of any increase will depend on a variety of factors, including how much of the tariffs the vendors pass on, the impact that the tariffs have on consumer and business demand, said ceo john stankey, on a conference call with analysts.

  Title: ‘The View’: Whoopi ‘Insulted’ by Trump-Backed $5,000 Baby Bonus Because You ‘Can’t Even Go to the Hospital’ for That
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-23 16:35:42)
  Content: the trump administration is reportedly mulling over the idea of giving out a 5,000 bonus to incentivize americans to have more children, and on wednesday mornings episode of the view, host whoopi goldberg scoffed at the offer. teeing up the topic for the table, the abc host put on her valley girl accent, something she typically reserves for mocking topics she is uninterested in or bothered by. in this case, it was the latter, and whoopi immediately explained why. i am incredibly insulted by this, because they clearly they dont know how womens bodies work, and they dont know what it costs to raise a child, or just have a child! she said. 5,000? i dont know what 5,000 is supposed to do. and its not even 5,000, because you have to cut it in half because you got to pay taxes on it. so theyre offering you 2,500 to have a baby! host alyssa farah griffin was quick to caveat that it would depend on your tax bracket, and actually supported the idea herself. as the conversation went on, farah griffin suggested that some money was better than no money, which whoopi promptly pushed back on. no, not in this case, whoopi shot back immediately. no. from there, the moderator went on to list various programs that have been victims of the trump administrations funding cuts specifically programs that are designed to help families. 1 billion in funding for schools and food banks, to buy food, was cut, she detailed. withdrew funding for investigating child sexual abuse and internet crimes against children, cut. fired the entire staff running a program to help low income households pay their heating and cooling bills. now, these families already exist! if you want people to have children, you have to not scare them by cutting all these programs that they may need, she added. as the discussion came to a close, whoopi once again noted how insulting the actual number is, pointing out that, in most cases, that wouldnt even make a dent in healthcare bills. i am insulted by that amount, because you cant even go to the hospital for 5,000 for goodness sakes, she said. the view airs weekdays at 11 a.m. et. the post the view whoopi insulted by trump-backed 5,000 baby bonus because you cant even go to the hospital for that appeared first on thewrap.

  Title: How Trump tariffs led to a $2.5 trillion wipeout for the US stock markets – and why worse is yet to come
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-04 15:13:26)
  Content: tech giant apple lost more than 300bn in market value from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. unless you happen to be an investor or trader who had shorted a lot of stocks prior to this week, it probably hasnt been an enjoyable experience watching some of the biggest and most well-known companies on the planet tumble ever-deeper into the red. by the close of play in the us on thursday, president donald trumps previous-day announcement of global tariffs had wiped just shy of an estimated 2.5 trillion, or 1.9tn, off the total value of us stock markets in the space of a few hours. for what is essentially a play at making his nation richer for the long term, it was quite the impact in the opposite direction - but mr trump remains steadfast in his beliefs that a longer-term gain will be made from his ploy of alienating most of the rest of the planet in business terms. on thursday, the sp 500 fell a total 4.8 per cent - that equated to a total market value wipeout of 2.48tn, the financial times calculated. thats not the end of the tough-to-read numbers though, with the dow industrial index dropping almost four per cent and the nasdaq dropping very close to six per cent. the nasdaq 100 is notoriously tech focused, making it almost a proxy for how quickly or how far modern businesses progress and enrich their shareholders - or the countries they pay taxes to - and on thursday that particular index lost out to the tune of 1.4tn 1.08tn, bloomberg estimate. while its important to note thats not an additional trillion on top of the two already mentioned - theres overlap of companies across indices - its still indicative of the pressures that white house policy will come under if the bleeding isnt stemmed soon. chip-related companies fell almost ten per cent as a group. amazon lost almost 200bn 154bn in market capitalisation value alone. the vix index, also known as the fear index, has risen 60 per cent in under a week, highlighting the prospect of greater volatility ahead. and the sell-off is far from done as futures are showed in pre-trading on friday hours ahead of the new york stock exchange opening, amazon was signalling another 1.3 per cent drop, tesla one per cent, apple one per cent. by two hours into friday trading, the sp 500 was down another 3.5 per cent, with amazon down to the tune of two per cent, apple broaching a four per cent loss and tesla a full 8.67 per cent in the red. these are just big-name companies in the public consciousness but non-tech-related corporations havent been spared. disney? down nine per cent yesterday and more than three per cent by friday 4pm bst. oil giant exxon mobil? 5.2 per cent drop thursday, four per cent mid-friday. and nike took a 14 per cent hit on the thursday - but after an initial dip friday staged a mid-session recovery, four per cent up as perhaps some investors eyed up a price weakness opportunity. thursday was the biggest single-day drop since covid and it clearly isnt finished yet. of course, given the tariffs were placed on other countries, it doesnt mean this was an america-only issue. share prices were jumpy across the globe even before the announcement, given the uncertainty it created, but the scale of them meant big hits in asia, europe and the uk - the latter two at least partially mitigated by the fact the likes of the ftse 100 and the dax in germany had climbed well earlier in the year. the markets are going to boom. the stock is going to boom. the country is going to boom. and the rest of the world wants to see is there any way they can make a deal, cnbc report trump saying. perhaps thats the case - in fact, given decades of stock market history, its almost certainly the case. the more pertinent question is whether theyll do so on his watch, under these plans, or if some other catalyst for recovery is required. investors looking to buy on the dip were spoiled for choice given the sharp declines seen on the market this week. its now a question of when investors feel brave enough to go shopping. todays extended sell-off implies they are still too nervous to take the plunge, noted russ mould of aj bell. one additional company to note apple fell 9.25 per cent in total on thursday. the most valuable public listed company on the planet in market capitalisation terms lost out to the tune of 310bn 240bn or so. the reasons why are obviously multi-layered, but a big portion of the reason is the tariffs applied to countries where they receive parts and materials from, in particular china. they had initiated a move in production to nearby nations, including vietnam, but a 46 per cent tariff applies there too. clearly, maintaining business in the same way would make apple products prohibitively expensive, so the threat of lost sales impacts share price immediately. an analysis by wedbush analyst dan ives, reported by yahoo finance, suggested it would take apple three years and 30bn 23bn to switch just a tenth of its supply chain to the us from asia. the trump administration confirmed there was no carve-out to the rules for apple. the stock market is widely used as an indicator of economic health and business growth of course, but its not the only thing that matters - and unfortunately for the us, many of the other markers are pointing negatively right now. measured against the pound, the dollar is a lot weaker now then even a few weeks ago on 20 january 1 bought 1.21 1.2171 to be precise on thursday it topped 1.31 for a spell, before pulling back to around 1.2990. fawad razaqzada, market analyst at city index, pointed out the selling went beyond shares in corporate america. as indices remained rooted in the bottom and the us dollar suffered a broad-based slump, it is clear that market sentiment is fragile, and this might not be the end of the selling. even gold, often a safe haven, could not escape the selling pressure, reinforcing fears that rising tariffs could spell trouble across asset classes. indeed, crude oil was even lower, he said. higher inflation appears a near-certainty. us stagflation is now a real concern for some economists and jp morgan foresee a 60 per cent chance of global recession if the tariffs stick. and more pain of lost income for businesses could be seen in the coming months. during a wave of uncertainty, one thing is evidenttrumps policies and pronouncements have produced a negative sentiment shift toward the us among international travelers. the correlating decline in international travel to the us is expected to be strongest in 2025, with persisting degrees of impact throughout the remainder of trumps second term, explained a report - highlighting an expected fall of 9.4 per cent in international visitors to the states. in monetary terms, oxford economics expect that to translate to a further loss of 9bn 6.9bn in the remainder of 2025. trump may have a grand plan to return the states to a more balanced, self-sufficient and thriving economy, but it needs a lot of pieces to fall into place to be the case. the start of that process has been painful indeed, with no immediate end in sight. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Dow Jones plunges more than 1,600 points as stock market recoils from Trump tariff shock - CBS News
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-04 11:08:26)
  Content: updated on april 4, 2025 708 am edt cbs news stocks cratered in the u.s. on thursday as anxious investors tried to assess the potential economic impact of the latest round of trump administration tariffs. the dow jones industrial average plunged 1,679 points, or 4, to close at 40,546. the sp 500 sank 274 points, or 4.8, its biggest one-day drop since covid-19 torpedoed financial markets in 2020. that amounts to a loss of roughly 2 trillion, according to data from factset. the tech-heavy nasdaq also suffered its worst session since the pandemic, dropping more than 1,050 points, or nearly 6. that nosedive reflects investor concerns about how steep tariffs on china, taiwan, vietnam and other manufacturing hubs could impact technology companies, analysts said. futures trading overnight pointed to more deep declines at the opening. as of 645 a.m. edt, the dow was down a whopping 1.053 points, the sp 142 points and the nasdaq 531.50 points, according to bloomberg. asian stocks fell further friday, though markets in shanghai, taiwan, hong kong and indonesia were closed for holidays, limiting the extent of the days declines, the associated press reported. tokyos nikkei 225 lost 2.8 while south koreas kospi sank 0.9. european markets lost more ground, the ap said. germanys dax fell 2. the cac 40 in paris was off 1.6. and britains ftse 100 declined 1.7. shares of apple, which has diversified its international supply chains in recent years but which still makes most of its iphones in china, dropped nearly 10 thursday. the new duties raise the nominal u.s. tariff rate on china to 54. investor psychology has been destroyed, and dip buyers are nowhere to be seen, equity analyst adam crisafulli, head of vital knowledge, said in a research note. all the efforts to spin recent events positively are increasingly falling flat. highlighting the extent of the losses nearly every major industrial sector suffered declines, with tech players, banks, retailers, apparel makers and airlines among the hardest hit. best buy shares sank roughly 18, united airlines fell 16 and nike slid 16, while even ai powerhouse nvidia saw its stock drop nearly 8. president trump on wednesday announced a 10 baseline tariff on all u.s. trading partners and increased levies on dozens of countries that charge higher taxes on american exports. mr. trump has said the goal is to make global commerce more fair, spur companies to expand in the u.s. and generate federal revenue. experts warn that sharply ramping up tariffs on imports, coupled with any retaliatory measures from other nations, could drive up inflation, dampen spending by consumers and businesses, and hurt economic growth. market uncertainty is likely to remain elevated in the weeks ahead, as investors consider likely downgrades to consensus u.s. economic and earnings growth forecasts, the risk of a tit-for-tat escalation in tariffs and the potential scope for tariffs announced to be negotiated down, solita marcelli, chief investment officer americas at ubs global wealth management, said in a note to investors. appearing on cnn thursday, white house press secretary karoline leavitt expressed confidence that the trump administrations economic policies would pay off. commenting on global financial markets sliding overnight, she said, to anyone on wall street this morning, i would say trust in president trump. financial markets surged after mr. trump was re-elected in november, with wall street counting on lower taxes and deregulation to fuel corporate profits. other investors bet on the trump administration threatening tariffs mostly as a way to pressure other countries into making concessions on trade, rather than a full-fledged push to change the terms of global commerce. but after hitting all-time highs in february, stocks have turned tail as the white house makes clear it wasnt bluffing. indeed, investors have been left stunned by the speed and scale of mr. trumps tariffs. in contrast to his first term, when he implemented levies on roughly 380 billion worth of goods over four years, mr. trump has imposed more than 3 trillion in tariffs in the less than three months since his return to power, according to the economic policy institute, a left-leaning think tank. markets may actually be underreacting, especially if these rates turn out to be final, given the potential knock-on effects to global consumption and trade, said sean sun, portfolio manager at thornburg investment management. including its thursday dive, the sp 500 is now down 8.2 this year, the dow has sunk 4.7 and the nasdaq has tumbled 14.3. despite the angst on wall street, economists note that the u.s. continues to grow, and most still put relatively low odds on a recession. hiring around the u.s. also remains healthy, with the nations unemployment rate hovering around 4. for borrowers, meanwhile, further signs the economy is at risk of stalling could encourage the federal reserve to lower its benchmark interest rate. the central bank last cut rates in december of 2024, but has kept them steady since then as policy makers seek to douse inflation. the

  Title: Stock market rout deepens as Dow plunges more than 2,200 points and Nasdaq enters bear market - CBS News
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-04 22:22:52)
  Content: updated on april 4, 2025 1159 pm edt cbs news financial markets ended a tumultuous week with a thud, as stocks tumbled for a second straight day on concerns about the economic fallout from new u.s. tariffs and the prospects of a global trade war. president trumps announcement of steep tariffs on wednesday shocked investors and sent economists scurrying to revise downward their forecasts for u.s. economic growth. federal reserve chair jerome powell also warned that the levies which include a 10 universal duty on all u.s. imports and reciprocal tariffs on nearly 90 countries are likely to dent the economy. while uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected, powell said in a speech friday in arlington, virginia. the same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth. the sp 500 fell 322 points, or nearly 6, to close at 5,074 the largest one-day slump in the broad-based index since march 16, 2020, when it lost 12. todays plunge erased 2.7 trillion in market value from the index. the decline wipes out more than a year of stock market gains, taking the sp 500 back to its levels in february 2024. the dow jones industrial average sank 2,231 points, or 5.5, and is down 14 since peaking in february. the nasdaq composite slid 963 points, or 5.8. that means the the tech-heavy index is now in a bear market, or when stocks drop at least 20 from their most recent high. tech stocks have flailed this week because of concerns that american tariffs on china along with countermeasures from beijing will hurt the high-tech sector, which has been key to driving corporate profits. the economic pain that will be brought by these tariffs is hard to describe and can essentially take the u.s. tech industry back a decade in the process while china steamrolls ahead, dan ives of wedbush securities said in a report. solita marcelli, chief investment officer americas at ubs global wealth management, told clients that the u.s. could tip into a recession later this year unless the u.s. moves to ease tariffs. in the near term, we believe the effective tariff rates could be higher still, and without president trump taking active steps to reduce tariffs over the next three to six months, we are likely to enter a downside scenario, including a meaningful u.s. recession and lower equity markets, he said in a research note. the free-fall amounts to the biggest two-day drop for the sp 500 and nasdaq since march 2020, when the pandemic began, and has wiped out trillions of dollars in investor wealth. drops of this magnitude arent unheard of on wall street, but theyre rare. over the last 25 years, the sp 500 has fallen 4 in a single day 38 times, according to adam turnquist, chief technical strategist for brokerage firm lpl financial. overseas markets also slid friday. in overnight trading in asia, tokyos nikkei 225 dropped 2.8, while south koreas kospi sank 0.9. in european trading, germanys dax lost 2, frances cac 40 in paris dipped 1.6 and britains ftse 100 shed 1.7. economists have downgraded their outlook for u.s. economic growth this year as mr. trump piles tariffs on a growing list of countries, warning that the levies are likely to boost inflation. that could reduce consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nations economic activity, as well as crimp business investment. import taxes are largely borne by businesses, which typically pass on part or much of those added costs to consumers. as a result, americans could face higher prices for electronics, household appliances, cars, clothing, furniture, and food such as coffee and chocolate, according to economists. looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters, powell said friday. according to the tax foundation, a nonpartisan policy research firm, the trump administrations tariffs could cost u.s. households more than 1,900 this year. david lefkowitz, head of u.s. equities at ubs global wealth management, thinks u.s. trade officials will eventually lower tariff rates as they negotiate with their counterparts abroad. but that process is likely to take time, and the investment bank doesnt expect a speedy reversal in u.s. tariffs. as a result, ubs economists have lowered their forecast for u.s. economic growth this year to less than 1. investors are also nervously watching as the barrage of u.s. tariffs prompts retaliation from key trading partners. china on friday said it will impose a 34 tariff on imports of all u.s. products starting april 10. the chinese commerce ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries as well impose trade sanctions on 27 additional u.s. companies. this is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely, analysts with capital economics said in a research note. in more upbeat news for financial markets, u.s. employers added 228,000 jobs in march, far exceeding analyst forecasts. the nations unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2, versus 4.1 in february. yet while job growth was robust last month, experts say the governments latest hiring numbers dont reflect the impact of the trump administrations trade policies on the economy. for investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia, brian jacobsen, chief economist at annex wealth management, said of this weeks downdraft in stocks. the associated press

  Title: Stocks Plunge as the Market Understood What Tariffs Are: A Tax on Corporate Profit Margins
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-03 21:56:00)
  Content: stocks tanked today as markets understood what tariffs actually are a tax on corporate profit margins that companies will have a very hard time passing on, which is why companies hate tariffs so much. if they could pass them on easily, they wouldnt care about tariffs their revenues would go up by the amount of the tariffs, and their profit margins in percentage terms could be maintained, and their stocks would keep rising. but thats not the case. the sp 500 fell 4.84 today. markets have been so spoiled. despite the decline of 12 from the high, the sp 500 is still up 4.8 year-over-year, and by 31 from two years ago. the nasdaq fell 5.97 today and is down 18 from the high. but its still up 3.1 year-over-year, and by 37 from two years ago. stock-price gains have been so huge for so long that these declines are practically minor. stocks have been at such precariously high levels that any little thing would knock them off their perch. longer-term treasury securities rallied, and yields fell, with the 10-year yield dropping to 4.03, a classic safe-haven trade. president trump outlined the new strategy of imposing layered tariffs on corporate profit margins yesterday in the rose garden, and encouraged companies to dodge those tariffs by shifting production to the us. one of the countries he singled out was ireland, where us big pharma companies have set up entities that make profits that are taxable under the low corporate income tax rates in ireland, but are not taxed by the us. and then they sell those products in the us without profit, thereby dodging corporate income taxes in the us. not paying income taxes in the us has widened the already big-fat profit margins of big pharma. other companies are doing the same thing. and so the us had this huge 87 billion trade deficit in goods with tiny ireland last year, and trump outlined how tariffs would change the math for this strategy. the 1 goal of tariffs is to bring production to the us and end the system of globalization at the expense of the us economy. the entire auto industry has already been expanding and building factories in the us in recent years. recently, numerous automakers have announced plans to build more factories in the us and produce more vehicles and components in the us. same in the semiconductor industry and other industries. it takes years to plan a factory, make a deal with local governments, buy the property, build the plant, equip the plant, and ramp up production, so this is not a short-term thing. all new factories in the us are highly automated, and employees are highly qualified, many of them are engineers. the prior trump tariffs were finalized in late 2018, after numerous changes, exemptions, carveouts, etc. by 2019 companies strategized and decided on how to deal with them long-term, including by planning to build factories in the us. then came covid in early 2020, and this process was put on hold. but in mid-2021, after the economy reopened, the first projects put all their ducks in a row, and the spending on the construction of factories started to soar, and it was the beginning of a historic construction boom. this was further powered by the biden administrations incentives. the chips act was passed in august 2022, and the first funds started flowing at the end of 2024. and now come the new incentives to build factories in the us in form of the new tariffs. this is a hugely important development for the long-term strength of the us economy. starting up a factory is a massive investment with immediate and long-term benefits for the us economy, including secondary and tertiary benefits. the chart below shows this boom of the amounts spent on construction of manufacturing facilities. but they do not include the investments in equipment, such as industrial robots, computers, etc. that dwarf the construction costs of the building. the 2 goal of tariffs is to impose taxes on corporate profits if companies decide to import, which forces companies to pay taxes that they might otherwise have dodged, such as big pharma and big tech that run their profits through ireland and other financial centers and pay zero income taxes in the us on those profits sheltered overseas. trump explained that yesterday, which may be why apple tanked 9 today. tariffs are bad for stocks because theyre tax on corporate profit margins. we know that, based on how stocks got hit in 2018 through the tariffs finally imposed then, and the sp 500 went down 20. i said in the headline on february 3 what trumps tariffs did last time 2018-2019 no impact on inflation, doubled receipts from customs duties, and hit stocks tariffs are bad for stocks because they extract taxes from companies, many of which would otherwise not pay income taxes in the us. hence lower stock prices. the market understands that now just fine, despite the relentless bs in the media that tariffs are sales tax for consumers. passing on higher costs to consumers is very hard. it tends to cause sales to plunge, as americans hate higher prices. and then, with sales dropping, the price increases are rolled back. the trump administration is refusing to let the addiction to inflated stock prices dictate essential long-term us economic policies. and markets are figuring it out. services exports dont compensate for imports of manufactured goods. services exports of the us fall mostly into two categories in addition, the services surplus the us has is small compared to the gigantic deficit in goods. enjoy reading wolf

  Content: ibm reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the first quarter on wednesday. revenue increased 0.6 in the quarter from 14.5 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. net income slid to 1.06 billion, or 1.12 per share, from 1.61 billion, or 1.72 per share, in the same quarter a year ago. the company accelerated productivity efforts, jim kavanaugh, its finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. for 2025, ibm reiterated its expectation for 13.5 billion in free cash flow and at least 5 revenue growth at constant currency. at current exchange rates, currency will provide 150 basis points of benefit for 2025 growth, down from the companys forecast of 200 basis points in january. management called for 16.4 billion to 16.75 billion in second-quarter revenue. the middle of the range, 16.58 billion, is ahead of the lseg consensus of 16.33 billion. ibm has become more cautious about the contribution of consulting, kavanaugh said on the conference call. while sentiment and the operating environment have been rapidly shifting, our performance reflects the continued success of our focused strategy around hybrid cloud and ai, especially where clients are looking for cost savings, productivity gains and trusted partners to help them move fast and scale, ibm ceo arvind krishna said on the call. those needs remain front and center in todays market. before going deeper into our results, let me start by saying that we appreciate the administrations focus on economic growth and rational regulation, which will strengthen the us competitive position. we believe this will result in long-term value creation and make it easier for technology to contribute to economic growth. in the first quarter, software revenue rose 7 to 6.34 billion, in line with the consensus among analysts polled by streetaccount. the hybrid cloud software category that includes red hat grew 12, compared with 16 in the fourth quarter. ibms consulting unit contributed 5.07 billion in revenue, which was down 2 and slightly above streetaccounts 5.05 billion consensus. the companys infrastructure division, which includes mainframe computers, posted a 6 decline in revenue to 2.89 billion, higher than the 2.76 billion consensus. earlier this month, ibm introduced its z17 mainframe. infrastructure revenue growth generally picks up as customers adopt the next generation and then drifts down late in the cycle. during the first quarter, ibm said it had settled its lawsuits with chip manufacturer globalfoundries. ibm also closed its 6.4 billion acquisition of cloud software maker hashicorp and announced plans to buy data storage software startup datastax for undisclosed terms. ibm has been an outperformer this year as the broader market has sold off due largely to concerns around president donald trumps tariffs and their potential impact on the economy. as of wednesdays close, ibm shares were up 11, while the nasdaq was down almost 14. in the near term, uncertainty may cause clients to pause and take a wait-and-see approach, krishna said, adding that buying behavior has not meaningfully changed so far in the second quarter. no one is immune from fallout from president trumps tariffs on imported goods, kavanaugh said in an interview with cnbcs jon fortt. under 5 of ibms spending comes from goods imported to the u.s, he said on the call. ibms customers are prioritizing efficient spending and the preservation of cash, kavanaugh told the wall street journal. the u.s. department of governmental efficiency had delayed or nixed 15 federal contracts, he told bloomberg. federal consulting is less than 10 of consulting, krishna said. most of that federal consulting is critical rather than discretionary, he said. signings an estimate of spending commitments under consulting contracts would have been higher in the first quarter if not for clients hesitating before making buying decisions, kavanaugh said on the conference call. there are areas of our portfolio that could see greater variability in the event that the macroeconomic environment deteriorates, he said. this includes consulting, which is more sensitive to discretionary pullbacks and doge-related initiatives, consumption-based services and software, including in red hat and areas of distributed infrastructure. watch uncertainty is the market is short-term, says ibm ceo krishna got a confidential news tip? we want to hear from you. sign up for free newsletters and get more cnbc delivered to your inbox get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services. 2025 cnbc llc. . a division of nbcuniversal data is a real-time snapshot data is delayed at least 15 minutes. global business and financial news, stock quotes, and market data and analysis.

  Title: US stock futures rebound after selloff; corporate earnings in focus - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 10:15:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory appears relevant as the article prominently features the political conflict between President Trump and the Federal Reserve Chair, as well as the impact of tariffs, immediately linking these factors to market movements. The text states the selloff was 'sparked by president donald trumps mounting criticism' and the rebound was helped by 'optimism on u.s. trade negotiations', suggesting these specific issues are framed as the primary drivers of market sentiment, potentially directing the reader's focus away from other underlying economic factors.; Theories_and_interpretations: Rational Choice Theory can be seen in the description of investor behavior. The article notes 'investors sifted through a slew of quarterly earnings' and 'awaited trumps next move', implying market participants are making decisions based on processing specific pieces of information (earnings data, political statements) to anticipate future outcomes (earnings hits, policy paths). This highlights the narrative's focus on investors as rational actors reacting to perceived risks and opportunities presented by political and economic developments.; Intriguing_angles: The phrase 'april 2 liberation day tariff announcement' is used to mark a point from which market declines are measured. The specific term 'liberation day' is unusual in this context and is not explained. What does the use of 'liberation day' in relation to a tariff announcement signify, and whose perspective might this framing represent within the broader trade narrative?; Intriguing_angles: The article emphasizes the 'relentless tussle' between Trump and Powell and 'rising tensions with the white house' regarding the Fed's autonomy. While presenting this as a market factor, the text doesn't delve into the institutional implications or the potential long-term effects on the credibility of independent economic institutions. How might this framing of a 'tussle' simplify or potentially misrepresent the complex relationship between political leadership and central bank independence, and what are the potential consequences for economic stability beyond immediate market reactions?

  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. by lisa pauline mattackal and purvi agarwal reuters - wall streets main indexes rebounded on tuesday from a steep selloff in the previous session sparked by president donald trumps mounting criticism of federal reserve chair jerome powell, as market focus shifted to corporate results. some optimism on u.s. trade negotiations also helped indexes hit session highs after a report that u.s. treasury secretary scott bessent had said a tariff standoff with china was unsustainable, and that he expects the situation to de-escalate. investors sifted through a slew of quarterly earnings, with dozens more due through the week, for indications on how companies are navigating the uncertainty caused by tariffs and a potential hit to future earnings. earnings were a mixed bag on the day. shares of industrial conglomerate 3m co, the biggest gainer on the blue-chip dow, jumped 6.9 after the company beat first-quarter profit expectations. on the other hand, northrop grumman slumped 11.75 after reporting a sharp drop in profit, while rtx tumbled 8.9 after the company flagged a potential hit of about 850 million to its annual profit from the tariffs. the overall mood remained fragile as investors awaited trumps next move in his relentless tussle with powell over interest rates, fueling concerns about the central banks autonomy and the future monetary policy path. wall street was down more than 2 on monday as trump doubled down against the fed chair. right now, it is that normal bounce after drops, said ryan dykmans, chief investment officer at dunham associates investment counsel. im actually putting a little more credibility on the drops than the bounce. there is still a lot of uncertainty here and that doesnt really bode well for the market in the short term. while the sp 500 recovered the ground it had lost on monday, it is yet to recoup declines since the april 2 liberation day tariff announcement and is more than 14 below its february 19 record closing high. at 1149 a.m. et, the dow jones industrial average rose 754.87 points, or 1.98, to 38,925.28, the sp 500 gained 97.99 points, or 1.90, to 5,256.19, and the nasdaq composite gained 332.19 points, or 2.09, to 16,203.09. megacaps also recovered, with nvidia rising 1.9 and apple up 2.8. all sectors on the sp 500 rose, with consumer discretionary leading gains. tesla, which will kick off earnings for the magnificent seven megacap stocks after markets close, jumped 5.2. the economic outlook, however, remains uncertain. the international monetary fund slashed its forecasts for growth in the u.s. on tuesday to 1.8 in 2025, while citigroup said the u.s. economy has a 40 to 45 chance of falling into a recession. commentary from several fed speakers is expected through the day and their remarks will be parsed for clues on the central banks policy outlook and view on rising tensions with the white house. advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6.28-to-1 ratio on the nyse, and a 3.73-to-1 ratio on the nasdaq. the sp 500 posted four new 52-week highs and one new low, while the nasdaq composite recorded 24 new highs and 61 new lows. reporting by lisa mattackal and purvi agarwal in bengaluru editing by pooja desai

      > Snippet: but jerome powell also said again that the fed will need more time before deciding whether to lower interest rates
  Content: new york ap u.s. stocks fell wednesday after nvidia warned new restrictions on exports to china will chisel billions of dollars off its results, while companies around the world said president donald trumps trade war is clouding forecasts for how they and the economy will do this year. the sp 500 sank 2.2 after falling as much as 3.3 earlier. such an amount would have vied for one of its worst losses in years before the historic, chaotic swings that have upended wall street in recent weeks. the dow jones industrial average dropped 699 points, or 1.7, and the nasdaq composite sank a market-leading 3.1. losses accelerated after the head of the federal reserve said again that trumps tariffs appear to be bigger than it expected, which could in turn slow the economy and raise inflation more than it had earlier thought. but jerome powell also said again that the fed will need more time before deciding whether to lower interest rates, which could help the economy but make inflation worse, or to do the opposite. all of this is highly uncertain, powell said. were thinking now, really before the tariffs have their effects, about how they might affect the economy. thats why were waiting really to see what the policies ultimately are, and then we can make a better assessment of what the economic effects will be. some companies are already seeing big effects because of changes from washington. nvidia dropped 6.9 after it said the u.s. government is restricting exports of its h20 chips to china, citing worries that they could be used to build a supercomputer. the restrictions could mean a hit of 5.5 billion to nvidias results for the first quarter, covering charges related to inventory and purchase commitments. advanced micro devices sank 7.3 after it said u.s. limits on exports to china for its own chips may mean a hit of up to 800 million for inventory and other charges. in amsterdam, asmls stock sank 5.2. the dutch company, whose machinery makes chips, said demand for artificial-intelligence technology is continuing to drive growth. however, the recent tariff announcements have increased uncertainty in the macro environment and the situation will remain dynamic for a while, ceo christophe fouquet said. the uncertainty around trumps trade war has been scrambling plans for companies across industries and around the world. its so dynamic that united airlines gave two different financial forecasts for how it may perform this year, one if theres a recession and one if not. the airline said it made the unusual move to give twin forecasts because it believes its impossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence. uniteds stock finished roughly flat even though it reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. many investors are bracing for a possible recession because of trumps tariffs, which he has said he hopes will bring manufacturing jobs back to the united states and trim how much more it imports from other countries than it exports. a survey of global fund managers by bank of america found expectations for recession are at the fourth-highest level in the last 20 years. the world trade organization said wednesday it expects tariffs to cause a 0.2 decline in the volume of world merchandise trade for 2025. thats if the tariff situation remains as it was on monday. trade could shrink by 1.5 this year if conditions worsen, the wto said. the enduring uncertainty threatens to act as a brake on global growth, with severe negative consequences for the world, the most vulnerable economies in particular, director-general ngozi okonjo-iweala said. one u.s. company that moves products around the continent, j.b. hunt transport services, tumbled 7.7 for one of wall streets sharper losses, even though it reported slightly stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. all told, the sp 500 fell 120.93 points to 5,275.70. the dow jones industrial average dropped 699.57 to 39,669.39, and the nasdaq composite sank 516.01 to 16,307.16. tariffs could also drive up inflation, at least temporarily, by pushing u.s. importers to pass along the higher costs to their customers. fears about such price hikes drove a spending binge last month, and sales at u.s. retailers accelerated by more than economists expected. economists said much of that was likely because of u.s. shoppers rushing to buy automobiles, electronics and other items before their prices could rise due to possible tariffs. recent surveys have shown u.s. households are feeling more pessimistic about the economy because of tariffs, and a fear is that it could lead them to pull back on their spending eventually, which could cause a recession by itself. treasury yields eased in the bond market, taking a leg lower following the comments from the feds chair. the yield on the 10-year treasury fell to 4.28 from 4.35 late tuesday and from 4.48 at the end of last week. its another notable move for the bond market and somewhat of a return to form after an unusual rise in yields last week rattled investors and trump. treasury yields typically fall when investors are worried about the economy, and last weeks climb raised concerns that the trade war may be causing investors to second-guess the reputation of u.s. government bonds as one of the worlds safest possible investments. in stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of asia and were mixed in europe. stocks dropped 1.9 in hong kong, 1 in tokyo, 1.2 in seoul and 0.1 in paris. the ftse 100 rose 0.3 in london after the government said inflation in the u.k. fell for the second month running in march, largely as a result of lower gas prices. ___ ap business writers matt ott and elaine kurtenbach

  Title: Stocks soar after Trump pauses "reciprocal tariffs" on most countries for 90 days - CBS News
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-10 12:20:50)
  Content: updated on april 10, 2025 820 am edt cbs news the stock market exploded higher on wednesday to one of their best days in history after president trump said he would place a 90-day pause on his reciprocal tariffs, adding that he would lower that rate to 10 for most countries effective immediately. the dow jones industrial average surged 2,963 points, or 7.9, to close at 40,608, while the broad-based sp 500 climbed 474 points, or 9.5, to 5,457. the tech heavy-nasdaq composite index jumped 1,857 points, or 12.2. the sp 500s gain was the biggest one-day increase since october 2008, according to financial services company factset. the nasdaqs gains were its largest since 2001, according to oxford economics. one notable exception to mr. trumps decision is china, with the president saying hes increasing the tariff rate on goods imported from that nation to 125. based on the lack of respect that china has shown to the worlds markets, i am hereby raising the tariff charged to china by the united states of america to 125, effective immediately, he wrote. prior to the announcement, the sp 500 had been down about 17 from its mid-february peak, pushing stocks toward a bear market, or when shares fall more than 20 from their most recent high, according to financial data firm factset. even with todays gain, the sp 500 remains 11 below its february 19 peak of 6,147. investors have been spooked by mr. trumps escalating trade war, which wall street economists warn could raise the risk of a recession and hurt u.s. corporations and consumers by hiking prices on products from almost every nation. even before mr. trumps announcement, some on wall street had expressed optimism that the white house could back down from the latest tariffs, which slapped rates of between 10 to 84 on u.s. trade partners. despite the pause, experts noted that uncertainty remains an issue for u.s. businesses, given that the tariffs could restart in 90 days and that the penalties on china a major trading partner are likely to dampen economic growth. businesses will be relieved that the destination for trade policy looks like it could be less disruptive than seemed possible yesterday, said bill adams, chief economist for comerica bank. even so, the huge overhang of policy uncertainty will weigh on investment and weak decisions in the next few months. he noted, also, 125 tariffs on chinese imports will be a huge problem for many businesses if they stay in place. the gains were widespread across the u.s. stock market, and 98 of the stocks in the sp 500 index rallied. among the best performers were tech stocks, including chipmaker nvidia, which gained 18.7, and apple, which jumped more than 15. also leading the way were airlines and other stocks that depend on customers feeling confident enough to travel for work or for vacation. delta air lines soared 23.4, while american airlines gained 22.6. still, the trade war continues between the u.s. and china continues to rage. on wednesday, china said it is raising its tariffs on u.s. products to 84, up from its previously announced 34, after president trumps import duties on chinese good went into effect today at a rate of 104. the retaliation signals beijing isnt backing down from mr. trumps global trade war. mr. trumps broad-based reciprocal tariffs, which apply to imports of almost every nation, had kicked in after midnight eastern time in the u.s. already, there are signs that some corporations are feeling the impact of mr. trumps tariff policies, with delta on wednesday pulling its guidance for 2025 as the trade war depresses bookings across the travel sector. with broad economic uncertainty around global trade, growth has largely stalled, ceo ed bastian said in a statement on wednesday. in this slower-growth environment, we are protecting margins and cash flow by focusing on what we can control. with corporate earnings season starting in the u.s., investors will be carefully watching the guidance from large companies such as delta. on wednesday, walmart said it is standing behind its full-year sales and operating income outlook even amidst the growing trade war. the nations largest retailer said that it expects first-quarter sales growth of 3 to 4, but added that its range of outcomes has widened due to less favorable category mix and the desire to maintain flexibility to invest in price as tariffs are implemented. the associated press contributed to this report. aimee picchi is the associate managing editor for cbs moneywatch, where she covers business and personal finance. she previously worked at bloomberg news and has written for national news outlets including usa today and consumer reports. 2025 cbs interactive inc. .

for its largest one-day drop. the drop happened as investors got spooked over the potential impact from president donald trumps tariff plan and fears it could spark a global trade war. trump has said the policy is necessary to level the playing field for american manufacturers. however, many economists have warned his plan could have a negative impact on the economy as tariffs are expected to

economic policy so totally ungrounded in serious analysis or so dangerous and damaging, i would have resigned in protest, he wrote thursday on x. while announcing his sweeping plan, trump vowed to usher in a golden age for america. but thursdays stock market lacked any of that luster. major companies including restaurant chains, retailers, and tech giants that rely on products from around the globe saw their stocks decline as they brace for supply chain disruptions. starbucks ended the day down 11 percent while chipotle fell nearly 4 percent. shares gap tanked 20 percent and macys dropped almost 14 percent. apple plunged more than 9 percent while amazon dipped nearly the same amount. some automakers also endured a rough day as trumps 25 percent tariff on imported cars took effect. tesla stock dropped almost 6 percent and stellantis, parent company of jeep, chrysler, and dodge, slid nearly 10 percent. stellantis announced thursday it was halting production at its factories in mexico and canada. about 900 u.s. employees are expected to be laid off, the automaker said thursday. meanwhile, investors seemed to have found some solace in comfort foods. french fry producer lamb weston gained 10 percent while general mills, coca-cola and kraft heinz each gained nearly 3 percent. thursdays market plunge didnt seem to ease fears that trumps liberation day could dwindle retirement funds tied to the stock markets. georgia taylor, founder of tailored wealth, told the financial times those near retirement must monitor their pensions closely. withdrawing during market downturns can deplete funds faster, so seeking advice on a flexible withdrawal strategy is crucial. this highlights the growing need for financial planning to make pensions last longer. the effect on the retirement savings will depend on the years a person has left until retirement, maggie switek, senior director on the research team at the milken institute, told the independent. for young adults, with a longer time horizon left until retirement, the effects may be offset by future changes in the market, with the stock markets trending upward over longer periods of time. hedge fund manager bradley wickens predicted thursday was just the beginning of a long road ahead for the fallout of trumps tariff plan. he told the wall street journal the true nature of how negative this is is going to take time to manifest itself during april and may, as it all dawns on everyone that, wow, these tariffs are here for a long time. the final impact of trumps plan is still to be determined as companies and other countries determine their response. european commission president ursula von der leyen called trumps decision a major blow to the global economy, adding we are now preparing for further countermeasures, to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail. canadian prime minister mark carney announced that his country plans to match the u.s.s 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles we take these measures reluctantly. and we take them in ways that is intended and will cause maximum impact in the united states and minimum impact in canada. in the face of tariff panic and market turbulence, asked how he thought things were going, trump replied i think its going very well. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their

  Title: Trump tariffs set stage for wave of profit warnings
  Source: finance.yahoo.com (2025-04-03 09:53:55)
  Content: by medha singh reuters - u.s. businesses have talked a lot about tariffs in the past few months, but very few modeled for them in their earnings outlooks. with president donald trumps multi-front trade war now in full effect, investors and analysts expect a barrage of corporate profit warnings in the coming weeks that could jolt the stock market. trumps escalation of threats to major world economies since returning to office in january has increased fears that inflation will rise and disrupt economic growth. the u.s. benchmark sp 500 closed out its worst quarter in more than three years at the end of march. tariffs of 10 across all imports to the united states, along with much higher levies on dozens of countries, are now set to take hold just about a week before big u.s. lenders kick off the quarterly reporting season, and companies now need to factor in the rapid deterioration of business and consumer sentiment and falling optimism among company finance chiefs. throughout the first three months of 2025, tariffs were mentioned more than 800 times on investor events or conference calls by non-financial companies globally, according to sp global market intelligence, highest in at least 15 years and nearly double the level seen during trumps first trade war in 2018-2019. however, only about 88 u.s. companies specifically mentioned they had not modeled tariff impact into their forecast as the global trade outlook was still evolving, according to sp. numerous others were non-specific as to whether they had modeled the potential effect of tariffs - leaving open the possibility of numerous surprises on conference calls this quarter. wall street analysts still expect record profit in 2025, leaving room for more potential downgrades. sp 500 profits are expected to rise 8 year-over-year for the quarter as of march 28, down from a 12 growth forecast on jan. 17, according to data compiled by lseg. ceos will latch onto an opportunity to lower expectations even if its painful - they can just say its the stupid tariffs, or headwinds, or currency conversion, said mark malek, chief investment officer at siebert financial in new york. the fears about tariffs have introduced an element of uncertainty into the economy, with consumers and businesses in some cases putting off purchases as the white houses on-again, off-again approach to tariffs made the environment more unpredictable. that may benefit some companies in the short-term - car sales were notably strong in march, increasing the likelihood for strong figures from ford and general motors. but other companies rapidly brought in inventories, which could be a drag on results for other sectors.

  Title: The Stock Market Pain Is Just Getting Started. ‘This is How You Sabotage the World’s Economic Engine.’
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 21:53:27)
  Content: april 02, 2025, 548 pm edt the stock market was slumping after president donald trump made his tariff announcement. to state the obvious, it was worse than investors feared and now they need to figure out what it means for stocks over the rest of 2025. on wednesday, president donald trump announced reciprocal tariffs at his liberation day event in the white house rose garden. according to the president, a minimum baseline tariff of 10 will be imposed on everyone, but additional reciprocal tariffs will be imposed as well on select countries. the new tariffs appear to be in addition to those announced on automotive imports and on china. car imports are going to be taxed at 25, as expected. the spdr sp 500 exchange-traded fund was down 2.2 in after-hours trading. the reciprocal tariffs and the 10 baseline levy seem to have caused the drop. the roundhill magnificent seven etf was down 2.4. president trump just finished his tariff speech at the white house and we would characterize this slate of tariffs as worse than the worst case scenario the street was fearing, writes wedbush analyst dan ives. - scroll to continue there is some reason for hope. the sp 500 spx0.67 is down about 8 from recent highs, reflecting a lot of bad news. if things can turn around on thursday, investors should watch the 5750 level in a rally. getting through that would certainly support the thesis that the worst of the correction is over, says jason browne, president of texas-based investment advisory firm alexis investment partners. hes optimistic that wednesday means the market will move past peak uncertainty. but the downside looms as well, with 5500 perhaps the next support level. if nothing else, the announcement means that volatility will continue, says venu krishna, barclays head of u.s. equity strategy. after tariffs, there are still questions about retaliation, inflation, consumer spending, and industrial production. krishna recently cut his 2025 earnings estimates for the sp 500 spx0.67 from 271 to 262, and monitoring scenarios that could wipe out 2025 earnings growth. krishna is staying positive on big tech stocks, though. pe ratios for apple aapl0.31, amazon.com, alphabet, meta platforms meta-0.35, microsoft, and nvidia nvda0.25 have fallen to about 24 times earnings, down 25 from a recent peak of 32 times, making the sector a good place to hide. tech earnings will continue to grow and where else would you want to hide if things go wrong? krishna asks rhetorically. - scroll to continue theyre not doing so well in after-hours trading, however. apple was down 6.1, amazon.com was off 5.1, alphabet had declined 3.3, had fallen 4.6, microsoft had dipped 2, nvidia had dropped 4.9, and tesla had slumped 5.8. sector rotation aside, some on wall street sound cautiously optimistic despite the late wednesday dip. we would be wary of complete risk-off or go to cash approaches that constrain future growth participation, says arnim holzer, global macro strategist at easterly eab risk solutions. still, the chances that something goes very wrong are high, as holzer acknowledges. this was a manufactured crisis, he says, one that means it can be resolved quicklyor get worse. reciprocal tariffs leave room for negotiations, but also for more pain and uncertainty to come, according to adam hetts, global head of multi-asset at janus henderson investors. eye-watering tariffs on a country-by-country basis scream negotiation tactic, which will keep markets on edge for the foreseeable future , he writes. weve seen the administration have a surprisingly high tolerance for market pain, now the big question is how much tolerance it has for true economic pain as negotiations unfold. so far, the pain has been contained to the sentiment indicators, chances are they wont stay that way. this is how you sabotage the worlds economic engine while claiming to supercharge it, writes nigel green, ceo of devere group. trump is blowing up the post-war system that made the u.s. and the world more prosperous, and hes doing it with reckless confidence. something that seems to be lacking right now. - scroll to continue write to al root at allen.rootdowjones.comexternal link

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
