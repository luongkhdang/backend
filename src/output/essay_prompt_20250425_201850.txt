  Title: Reams of documents related to L.A. County sex abuse cases never turned over, lawyers say
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:11:23)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article illustrates aspects of the Principal-Agent Problem within the context of public institutions. The county (the principal, representing the public interest) delegates authority to its probation staff (the agents). The text highlights alleged failures of the agents (abuse) and a potential failure of the principal (the county) to adequately oversee, document, and respond to these actions over decades, as evidenced by the discovery dispute and the large settlement payout. This suggests a breakdown in the mechanisms designed to ensure agents act in the best interest of the principal and those they serve.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative around AB 218 and subsequent legislative proposals (like SB 577) reflects elements of Agenda-Setting Theory. The large volume of lawsuits enabled by AB 218 (an event/policy) has forced the issue of institutional liability and financial burden onto the legislative agenda, prompting lawmakers to propose new bills aimed at managing the fallout. The framing by Senator Laird about 'restoring equilibrium' suggests an attempt to shape the public and legislative perception of the problem and the proposed solution.

  Content: thousands of documents that could contain key details about rampant childhood sexual abuse inside a defunct santa clarita detention camp including so-called grooming drawings were left scattered inside the facility and never turned over to the victims attorneys, according to a firm suing l.a. county over the decades-old incidents. as part of the preparation for a looming june trial, attorneys with law firm manly, stewart finaldi had arranged april 15 to visit camp scott, a shuttered l.a. county probation camp where many of their clients say they were sexually abused as children. inside the facility were reams of records that the county should have turned over to the firm more than a year ago through discovery, said attorney courtney thom, whose firm has about 150 civil cases alleging sexual abuse by county probation staff. you can understand my shock when im walking through where my clients got raped as children, and there are documents everywhere, thom said at a monday superior court hearing in downtown los angeles. thom said she discovered thousands of paper grievances, a locked file cabinet labeled personnel files camps a w, and a drawing she believed was signed by thomas jackson a probation deputy accused by at least 20 women of sexually assaulting them at the camp. the drawing, included in a court filing, was of the name tami in big, block orange letters and appeared to be signed by a jackson. t. attorney james sargent, who is representing the county and accompanied thom for the tour last week, called her claims inflammatory and incorrect. they want to air what they deem as dirty laundry, said sargent, who told l.a. superior court judge lawrence riff that the personnel files they discovered had nothing to do with the staff named in the lawsuits. nor did the drawing, he said. tami wilson, a former supervisor at the camp, told him she recalled being given the hand-drawn card by a youth, he wrote in a court filing. the county announced earlier this month they planned to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of alleged sexual abuse inside the countys juvenile facilities and foster homes. the settlement believed to be the largest sex abuse settlement in u.s. history arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to file civil suits against alleged predators and the agencies that employed them. a handful of prominent firms including manly, stewart finaldi declined to participate in the settlement and have ongoing litigation. in the aftermath of ab 218, state legislators have introduced several bills to attempt to make it easier for governments and school districts to deal with the financial fallout from the deluge of suits. one of these bills sb 577 is set for a hearing tuesday. the bills author, state sen. john laird, said the legislation is intended to restore some equilibrium, lessening the financial blow to public agencies while still upholding a victims right to sue. county lawyers claim one reason the state law change has had such a devastating financial toll is because many of the records they need to fight decades-old cases are long gone. attorney john manly argued the claim flew in the face of what his firm saw at camp scott. the county has been telling all of sacramento that they dont have any documents, said manly, who urged the judge to allow his firm to publicize the footage theyd taken of the heaps of documents. we need to be able to share this with legislators. riff agreed with the countys request that the videos from inside camp scott remain confidential for now due to security risks, though he instructed both sides to try to find some common ground on whether certain videos could be made public. though camp scott hasnt been used to house youths for years, sargent wrote in a filing that may soon change. l.a. county superior court judge miguel espinoza ordered the county friday to prepare to shut down los padrinos juvenile hall the countys last remaining juvenile hall, where roughly 270 youths are held due to problems stemming from chronic understaffing. the youth presently in los padrinos will need to go somewhere, and if some wind up at camp scott, the public release of photos and videos could be seriously detrimental, sargent wrote. thom noted that both reporters and television crews have been allowed to broadcast footage taken inside the camp, including a 2001 documentary, camp scott lock-up. the l.a. times has been in there to photograph, said thom. mtv videoed more than we did.

  Title: Coca-Cola under fire after bombshell report exposes ties to controversial industry: 'The cost is irreversible damage to our children's health'
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-22 11:30:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying the concept of Externalities, the article highlights how the social costs of fracking and plastic production (environmental damage, health issues) are not fully borne by the companies involved (Coca-Cola, Unilever, etc.). The text states, 'the fracking process creates environmental damage and can significantly impact local communities' and mentions 'irreversible damage to our childrens health'. This suggests a market failure where the price of plastic does not reflect its true cost to society, leading to overproduction and consumption.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Coca-Cola's 'World Without Waste' initiative but then states 'its link to fracking operations suggests it is still looking to create new plastics.' This juxtaposition creates a contradiction. What are the specific mechanisms preventing Coca-Cola from fully transitioning to recycled plastics, and could these mechanisms be related to the profitability of fracking-derived plastics?

  Title: World’s biggest companies have caused US$28-trillion in climate damage, study estimates
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-23 18:00:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying the 'Polluter Pays' principle, a cornerstone of environmental economics, the article highlights the attempt to quantify the climate damage caused by major corporations. The text states, 'people talk about making polluters pay, and sometimes even take them to court or pass laws meant to rein them in.' This principle suggests that those who cause pollution should bear the costs of managing it to prevent damage to human health or the environment. This study attempts to provide the empirical evidence needed to enforce this principle, potentially leading to significant financial and legal repercussions for the identified companies.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'aramco, gazprom, chevron, exxon mobil and bp did not respond to requests for comment.' This silence from major corporations, especially in the face of such a damning study, is noteworthy. What strategies might these companies be employing to mitigate the potential fallout from these findings? Could this silence be interpreted as an implicit acknowledgment of the study's validity, or is it a calculated move to avoid further scrutiny?; Intriguing_angles: The article notes that the researchers used '1,000 different computer simulations' and '80 more computer simulations' to translate emissions into temperature changes and economic output. The reliance on complex modeling raises questions about the inherent uncertainties and potential biases within these simulations. How sensitive are the study's conclusions to variations in the model's parameters or assumptions? Could different modeling approaches yield significantly different results, potentially undermining the study's claims of precise attribution?

said dartmouth climate scientist justin mankin, co-author of the study. and that really comes down to a thermodynamic question of can we trace climate hazards andor their damages back to particular emitters? the answer is yes, callahan and mankin said. the researchers started with known final emissions of the products such as gasoline or electricity from coal-fired power plants produced by the 111 biggest carbon-oriented companies going as far back as 137 years, because thats as far back as any of the companies emissions data go and carbon dioxide stays in the air for much longer than that. they used 1,000 different computer simulations to translate those emissions into changes for earths global average surface temperature by comparing it to a world without that companys emissions. using this approach, they determined that pollution from chevron, for example, has raised the earths temperature by .045 degrees fahrenheit .025 degrees celsius. the researchers also calculated how much each companys pollution contributed to the five hottest days of the year using 80 more computer simulations and then applying a formula that connects extreme heat intensity to changes in economic output. this system is modeled on the established techniques scientists have been using for more than a decade to attribute extreme weather events, such as the 2021 pacific northwest heat wave, to climate change. mankin said that in the past, there was an argument of, whos to say that its my molecule of co2 thats contributed to these damages versus any other one? he said his study really laid clear how the veil of plausible deniability doesnt exist anymore scientifically. we can actually trace harms back to major emitters. shell declined to comment. aramco, gazprom, chevron, exxon mobil and bp did not respond to requests for comment. all methods they use are quite robust, said imperial college london climate scientist friederike otto, who heads world weather attribution, a collection of scientists who try rapid attribution studies to see if specific extreme weather events are worsened by climate change and, if so, by how much. she didnt take part in the study. it would be good in my view if this approach would be taken up more by different groups. as with event attribution, the more groups do it, the better the science gets and the better we know what makes a difference and what does not, otto said. so far, no climate liability lawsuit against a major carbon emitter has been successful, but maybe showing how overwhelmingly strong the scientific evidence is can change that, she said. in the past, damage caused by individual companies were lost in the noise of data, so it couldnt be calculated, callahan said. we have now reached a point in the climate crisis where the total damages are so immense that the contributions of a single companys product can amount to tens of billions of dollars a year, said chris field, a stanford university climate scientist who didnt take part in the research. this is a good exercise and proof of concept, but there are so many other climate variables that the numbers that callahan and mankin came up with are probably a vast underestimate of the damage the companies have really caused, said michael mann, a university of pennsylvania climate scientist who wasnt involved in the study. a daily look at the most important business stories that are making news and moving markets, written by chris wilson-smith sign upexplore newsletters

  Content: washington ap the worlds biggest corporations have caused 28 trillion in climate damage, a new study estimates as part of an effort to make it easier for people and governments to hold companies financially accountable, like the tobacco giants have been. a dartmouth college research team came up with the estimated pollution caused by 111 companies, with more than half of the total dollar figure coming from 10 fossil fuel providers saudi aramco, gazprom, chevron, exxonmobil, bp, shell, national iranian oil co., pemex, coal india and the british coal corporation. for comparison, 28 trillion is a shade less than the sum of all goods and services produced in the united states last year. at the top of the list, saudi aramco and gazprom have each caused a bit more than 2 trillion in heat damage over the decades, the team calculated in a study published in wednesdays journal nature. the researchers figured that every 1 of greenhouse gas put into the atmosphere since 1990 has caused 502 billion in damage from heat alone, which doesnt include the costs incurred by other extreme weather such as hurricanes, droughts and floods. people talk about making polluters pay, and sometimes even take them to court or pass laws meant to rein them in. the study is an attempt to determine the causal linkages that underlie many of these theories of accountability, said its lead author, christopher callahan, who did the work at dartmouth but is now an earth systems scientist at stanford university. the research firm zero carbon analytics counts 68 lawsuits filed globally about climate change damage, with more than half of them in the united states. everybodys asking the same question what can we actually claim about who has caused this? said dartmouth climate scientist justin mankin, co-author of the study. and that really comes down to a thermodynamic question of can we trace climate hazards andor their damages back to particular emitters? the answer is yes, callahan and mankin said. the researchers started with known final emissions of the products such as gasoline or electricity from coal-fired power plants produced by the 111 biggest carbon-oriented companies going as far back as 137 years, because thats as far back as any of the companies emissions data go and carbon dioxide stays in the air for much longer than that. they used 1,000 different computer simulations to translate those emissions into changes for earths global average surface temperature by comparing it to a world without that companys emissions. using this approach, they determined that pollution from chevron, for example, has raised the earths temperature by .045 degrees fahrenheit .025 degrees celsius. the researchers also calculated how much each companys pollution contributed to the five hottest days of the year using 80 more computer simulations and then applying a formula that connects extreme heat intensity to changes in economic output. this system is modeled on the established techniques scientists have been using for more than a decade to attribute extreme weather events, such as the 2021 pacific northwest heat wave, to climate change. mankin said that in the past, there was an argument of, whos to say that its my molecule of co2 thats contributed to these damages versus any other one? he said his study really laid clear how the veil of plausible deniability doesnt exist anymore scientifically. we can actually trace harms back to major emitters. shell declined to comment. aramco, gazprom, chevron, exxon mobil and bp did not respond to requests for comment. all methods they use are quite robust, said imperial college london climate scientist friederike otto, who heads world weather attribution, a collection of scientists who try rapid attribution studies to see if specific extreme weather events are worsened by climate change and, if so, by how much. she didnt take part in the study. it would be good in my view if this approach would be taken up more by different groups. as with event attribution, the more groups do it, the better the science gets and the better we know what makes a difference and what does not, otto said. so far, no climate liability lawsuit against a major carbon emitter has been successful, but maybe showing how overwhelmingly strong the scientific evidence is can change that, she said. in the past, damage caused by individual companies were lost in the noise of data, so it couldnt be calculated, callahan said. we have now reached a point in the climate crisis where the total damages are so immense that the contributions of a single companys product can amount to tens of billions of dollars a year, said chris field, a stanford university climate scientist who didnt take part in the research. this is a good exercise and proof of concept, but there are so many other climate variables that the numbers that callahan and mankin came up with are probably a vast underestimate of the damage the companies have really caused, said michael mann, a university of pennsylvania climate scientist who wasnt involved in the study. ___ follow seth borenstein on x at borenbears. the associated press climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. ap is solely responsible for all content. find aps standards for working with philanthropies, a list of supporters and funded coverage areas at ap.org. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: In unprecedented payout, L.A. County will settle sex abuse claims for $4 billion
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-04 16:30:44)
  Content: a woman who alleges she was sexually assaulted as a child at the now-closed maclaren childrens center. thousands of former foster children have sued, alleging abuse by staff there. los angeles county plans to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of childhood sexual abuse that allegedly occurred inside its juvenile facilities and foster homes, dwarfing the largest sex abuse settlements in u.s. history. the mammoth settlement, which still needs to be approved by both the county claims board and county supervisors, is a billion dollars more than what county officials had anticipated as the worst-case scenario to resolve a flurry of lawsuits and far more than other organizations notorious for allowing unchecked sex abuse have paid victims. the boy scouts of america, by comparison, agreed to pay 2.46 billion. the archdiocese of los angeles has paid out about 1.5 billion for alleged abuse at the hands of catholic priests. victims of usc gynecologist george tyndall got 1.1 billion. michigan state university paid 500 million to victims of team doctor larry nassar. the unprecedented settlement stems from ab 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to sue, even though the statute of limitations had expired. many california counties, which are responsible for the care of children in foster homes and juvenile halls, saw an uptick in lawsuits. for l.a. county, it was a deluge that still hasnt stopped. thousands of men and women came forward to say they had been molested or raped by probation officials decades ago while incarcerated as children in the countys sprawling network of juvenile halls and camps. thousands more alleged sexual abuse at the now-shuttered maclaren childrens center , a county-run home for foster children that plaintiffs attorneys have compared to a house of horrors. a report found that the facility went decades without doing criminal background checks on its staff. taken together, the thousands of lawsuits, most of which involve alleged abuse from the 1980s through the 2000s, paint a picture of a government that failed to intervene as its facilities turned into hunting grounds for predators, who held immense power over the children in their custody. on behalf of the county, i apologize wholeheartedly to everyone who was harmed by these reprehensible acts, said l.a. county chief executive officer fesia davenport in a statement. she said the county has worked in recent years to crack down on sexual abuse of minors. improvements touted by the county include bolstering the vetting of foster parents and probation staffers and winding down the use of group homes like maclaren childrens center. davenport made headlines in 2023 when she estimated in a public budget hearing that the county could be looking at 1.6 billion to 3 billion in liability for the roughly 3,000 sex abuse claims it expected. her estimate was met with shock and a dash of skepticism from seasoned attorneys suing the county, who said it would blow any previous sex abuse payout out of the water. since then, thousands of additional victims have sued, with more coming forward every month. in addition to creating a three-year window for victims, which closed at the end of 2023 , the new state law let plaintiffs sue if they were under the age of 40 or had recently discovered the abuse they suffered as children. the county said the 4-billion settlement covers most but not all of the childhood sexual abuse lawsuits. some attorneys were not willing to participate in the global mediation process, and negotiations are underway with plaintiffs in those cases, according to the county. the settlement does not include any of the 150 cases filed by manly, stewart finaldi, one of the most high-profile sex-abuse law firms negotiating with the county, according to courtney thom, a partner with the firm. resolving those cases could end up costing the county millions more. patrick mcnicholas, whose law firm is representing 1,200 plaintiffs, said he was mindful during settlement discussions to reach for a number that would bring some justice to the thousands of victims without bankrupting the county, which serves as the regions social safety net. he reasoned that the government could stay solvent with a 4-billion payout and yet it was still the largest sex abuse payout he has ever heard of. this is a historic settlement, he said, noting that he couldnt find a larger sex abuse settlement anywhere in the world. it recognizes the horrific harm that has been done. dominique anderson, pictured around age 11, is one of thousands of plaintiffs who have sued over abuse at the countys juvenile faculties. anderson said her probation officers boss molested her in a motel room when she was around 13. dominique anderson the 4-billion payout will be a huge blow to a county already in tumultuous financial waters, thanks to threats of funding cuts from the trump white house and the cost of recovering from the devastating palisades and eaton wildfires. davenport has warned that the county government , which has a roughly 49-billion budget, could face a fiscal crisis unless hiring is frozen. county officials have said the money will come from draining the countys rainy day fund, slashing department budgets and taking out bonds. the county is expected to owe hundreds of millions of dollars in interest on those bonds, which have to be paid off by 2051. the county said it will pay out the settlement money between january 2026 and jan. 30, 2030, providing the billions to independent allocators who will decide how to divvy it up among the roughly 6,800 plaintiffs. there have been few criminal prosecutions of county staffers accused of abuse in the lawsuits. the probation department presented the l.a. county district attorneys office with evidence against two staff members, thomas jackson and altovise abner, in december 2023. the status of those cases was not immediately available.

  Title: Maryland Lawmakers Pass Bill to Limit Future Liabilities Amid Thousands of Claims of Sexual Abuse
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-05 20:39:35)
  Content: annapolis, md. ap maryland lawmakers passed a measure saturday to try to limit future liabilities from claims of sexual abuse at state and private institutions after thousands of people unexpectedly came forward with allegations of abuse, many of them in youth detention centers, putting potentially billions of dollars at stake for the state. the wave of cases targeting the states juvenile justice system resulted after maryland eliminated the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse claims two years ago with the catholic church abuse scandal in mind. the measure, which now goes to gov. wes moore, reduces caps on settlements from 890,000 to 400,000 for cases filed after may 31 for state institutions and from 1.5 million to 700,000 for private institutions. it also changes the 2023 law to only allow each claimant to receive one payment, instead of being able to collect for each incident of abuse. in california on friday, los angeles county officials announced they had reached a 4 billion agreement to settle nearly 7,000 claims of sexual abuse in juvenile facilities since 1959. other private and public entities have been rocked by allegations of wide-ranging abuse and subsequent settlements. the agreement in california, which still needs a county boards approval, far surpasses a 2.6 billion settlement reached in 2022 with boy scouts of america, which recently renamed itself scouting america. that settlement involved more than 80,000 men who said they were molested as children by scouting leaders and others. maryland state sen. will smith, who chairs the senate judicial proceedings committee, said it has been estimated that maryland is facing a potential liability between 3 billion and 4 billion. smith, a democrat, noted that lawmakers approved the 2023 child victims act in response to a long fight to have justice for victims of child sex abuse, where our prior framework barred some of those claims if you were above the age of 38. but what we could never have anticipated was just the sheer volume of cases that ensued, smith said. during debate saturday, lawmakers said about 1,500 cases already have been filed. in addition, another 4,500 cases are known about, lawmakers said, and attorneys for plaintiffs have been in settlement discussions with maryland attorney general anthony browns office. sen. justin ready, a republican who is the senate minority whip, said the state liability could potentially be even higher than the estimate cited by smith. we just spent all session wrestling with a 3 billion deficit, which is a huge deficit, and weve been fighting about that and debating it discussing it just one settlement from this very well could end up being that entire amount, and that is not the end of this, ready said. sen. chris west said he doubted the provision in the bill that would limit someone to only sue for one individual case, rather than for each incident of abuse, would survive a court challenge, based on prior rulings by the maryland supreme court. if the supreme court follows the guidance of prior supreme court decisions, they will hold that our attempt to deny people the right to file cases to recover for multiple occurrences is unconstitutional, because those rights for the past two years have been vested, west, a republican, said. the people have had the right to file those cases. smith told reporters on friday that he believed a settlement is the optimal solution here. were hoping that the attorney general and the plaintiffs can get together and work out a settlement, smith said. maryland lawmakers passed the child victims act in the immediate aftermath of a scathing investigative report by the attorney generals office that revealed widespread abuse within the archdiocese of baltimore. before its passage, victims couldnt sue after they turned 38. the law change prompted the archdiocese to file for bankruptcy to protect its assets. the maryland supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the law in a 4-3 ruling in february. the measure approved saturday also would cap attorneys fees at 20 for cases that settle out of court and 25 for cases resolved in court. the senate voted 36-7 for the bill on saturday, and the house voted 92-40 for the bill a short time later, sending the bill to the governor. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: Reams of documents related to L.A. County sex abuse cases never turned over, lawyers say
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 00:11:23)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article illustrates aspects of the Principal-Agent Problem within the context of public institutions. The county (the principal, representing the public interest) delegates authority to its probation staff (the agents). The text highlights alleged failures of the agents (abuse) and a potential failure of the principal (the county) to adequately oversee, document, and respond to these actions over decades, as evidenced by the discovery dispute and the large settlement payout. This suggests a breakdown in the mechanisms designed to ensure agents act in the best interest of the principal and those they serve.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative around AB 218 and subsequent legislative proposals (like SB 577) reflects elements of Agenda-Setting Theory. The large volume of lawsuits enabled by AB 218 (an event/policy) has forced the issue of institutional liability and financial burden onto the legislative agenda, prompting lawmakers to propose new bills aimed at managing the fallout.

  Content: thousands of documents that could contain key details about rampant childhood sexual abuse inside a defunct santa clarita detention camp including so-called grooming drawings were left scattered inside the facility and never turned over to the victims attorneys, according to a firm suing l.a. county over the decades-old incidents. as part of the preparation for a looming june trial, attorneys with law firm manly, stewart finaldi had arranged april 15 to visit camp scott, a shuttered l.a. county probation camp where many of their clients say they were sexually abused as children. inside the facility were reams of records that the county should have turned over to the firm more than a year ago through discovery, said attorney courtney thom, whose firm has about 150 civil cases alleging sexual abuse by county probation staff. you can understand my shock when im walking through where my clients got raped as children, and there are documents everywhere, thom said at a monday superior court hearing in downtown los angeles. thom said she discovered thousands of paper grievances, a locked file cabinet labeled personnel files camps a w, and a drawing she believed was signed by thomas jackson a probation deputy accused by at least 20 women of sexually assaulting them at the camp. the drawing, included in a court filing, was of the name tami in big, block orange letters and appeared to be signed by a jackson. t. attorney james sargent, who is representing the county and accompanied thom for the tour last week, called her claims inflammatory and incorrect. they want to air what they deem as dirty laundry, said sargent, who told l.a. superior court judge lawrence riff that the personnel files they discovered had nothing to do with the staff named in the lawsuits. nor did the drawing, he said. tami wilson, a former supervisor at the camp, told him she recalled being given the hand-drawn card by a youth, he wrote in a court filing. the county announced earlier this month they planned to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of alleged sexual abuse inside the countys juvenile facilities and foster homes. the settlement believed to be the largest sex abuse settlement in u.s. history arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to file civil suits against alleged predators and the agencies that employed them. a handful of prominent firms including manly, stewart finaldi declined to participate in the settlement and have ongoing litigation. in the aftermath of ab 218, state legislators have introduced several bills to attempt to make it easier for governments and school districts to deal with the financial fallout from the deluge of suits. one of these bills sb 577 is set for a hearing tuesday. the bills author, state sen. john laird, said the legislation is intended to restore some equilibrium, lessening the financial blow to public agencies while still upholding a victims right to sue. county lawyers claim one reason the state law change has had such a devastating financial toll is because many of the records they need to fight decades-old cases are long gone. attorney john manly argued the claim flew in the face of what his firm saw at camp scott. the county has been telling all of sacramento that they dont have any documents, said manly, who urged the judge to allow his firm to publicize the footage theyd taken of the heaps of documents. we need to be able to share this with legislators. riff agreed with the countys request that the videos from inside camp scott remain confidential for now due to security risks, though he instructed both sides to try to find some common ground on whether certain videos could be made public. though camp scott hasnt been used to house youths for years, sargent wrote in a filing that may soon change. l.a. county superior court judge miguel espinoza ordered the county friday to prepare to shut down los padrinos juvenile hall the countys last remaining juvenile hall, where roughly 270 youths are held due to problems stemming from chronic understaffing. the youth presently in los padrinos will need to go somewhere, and if some wind up at camp scott, the public release of photos and videos could be seriously detrimental, sargent wrote. thom noted that both reporters and television crews have been allowed to broadcast footage taken inside the camp, including a 2001 documentary, camp scott lock-up. the l.a. times has been in there to photograph, said thom. mtv videoed more than we did.

      > Snippet: the lawsuit from the global strategic litigation council and other human right groups was filed before the u.n. committee that monitors the implementation of the convention on the rights of the child
  Content: mexico city ap a group of human rights lawyers is suing costa rica, alleging the central american nation violated the rights of dozens of migrant children by detaining them in a rural camp for nearly two months after they were deported from the u.s. in february. the children, some as young as 2, are part of a group of hundreds of migrants from mostly asian countries afghanistan, china, russia and others who were deported from the u.s. as part of a wider effort by the trump administration to ramp up deportations. many had hoped to seek asylum in the u.s. and expressed fear over returning to their own countries. instead, they were dropped in costa rica and panama, where they dont speak the local language. the countries were originally intended as a kind of deportation layover, but the migrants have now spent 50 days in limbo. critics described it as a way for the u.s. to export its deportation process, while human rights groups have warned that the two countries were turning into a black hole for deportees. in costa rica, around 200 migrants, 81 of them children, were driven out to a rural migrant processing center along the costa rica-panama border and detained in a former factory building. the lawsuit from the global strategic litigation council and other human right groups was filed before the u.n. committee that monitors the implementation of the convention on the rights of the child on thursday night, and alleges that costa rica violated the convention. silvia serna roman, one of the attorneys filing the suit, said the migrants were held in detention without legal status, with no access to educational services or mental health services in their native language. it has fueled concern the long-term impacts that extended detention could have on the children as many parents have reported their children appearing isolated or sad. the kids are in a very crucial part of their development, and they are all fleeing complicated contexts in their countries. and now theyre subjected to detention for different, but long periods of time and inhumane treatment, serna roman said friday. the parents are concerned. serna roman said migrants have had little access to legal counsel. the costa rican government has said migrants could leave the detention facility if they agree to return to their countries of origin or seek asylum in costa rica. but the lawyer said many families fear they would have nowhere to go and potentially end up on the street, so theyve remained in indefinite detention in the facility known as catem. many people are afraid to leave catem because at least it means shelter, means three meals a day, means a roof over their heads, serna roman said. the costa rican government hasnt been upfront about how they plan to further protect these people. the associated press has repeatedly been denied access to the detention facility since the migrants arrived, but when journalists visited the camp in 2023, families were sleeping on cardboard or in tents on the ground where some say liquid from portable toilets leaks with sparse food. costa rican officials have disputed reports by the countrys ombudsmans office that the deportees arrived in costa rica in visible distress and that authorities failed to guarantee proper conditions for arriving deportees. costa rican president rodrigo chaves said in february that in accepting the asian migrants, his country was helping the economically powerful brother to the north. the suit by gslc and local human rights groups is just the latest in a number of legal fights that have popped up surrounding deportees sent to central american countries. the same group of lawyers filed a similar case against panama, which was holding migrants in hotels and in remote camps near the darien gap, where deportees said they were stripped of their phones. sharp criticisms prompted the panamanian government to release the migrants on the streets of panama city last month, leaving many migrants to fend for themselves. most recently, the deportation of groups of venezuelan migrants and an american citizen to el salvador, where they have been held in a high security prison for gangs, with little evidence to support alleged gang affiliations has also fueled legal battles and fierce political fights. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

maryland lawmakers passed a measure saturday to try to limit future liabilities from claims of sexual abuse at state and private institutions after thousands of people unexpectedly came forward with allegations of abuse, many of them in youth detention centers, putting potentially billions of dollars at stake for the state. the wave of cases targeting the states juvenile justice system resulted after maryland eliminated the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse claims two years ago with the catholic church abuse scandal in mind. the measure, which now goes to gov. wes moore, reduces caps on settlements from 890,000 to 400,000 for cases filed after may 31 for state institutions and from 1.5 million to 700,000 for private institutions. it also changes the 2023 law to only allow each claimant to receive one payment, instead of being able to collect for each incident of abuse. in california on friday, los angeles county officials announced they had reached a 4 billion agreement to settle nearly 7,000 claims of sexual abuse in juvenile facilities since 1959. other private and public entities have been rocked by allegations of wide-ranging abuse and subsequent settlements. the agreement in california, which still needs a county boards approval, far surpasses a 2.6 billion settlement reached in 2022 with boy scouts of america, which recently renamed itself scouting america. that settlement involved more than 80,000 men who said they were molested as children by scouting leaders and others. maryland state sen. will smith, who chairs the senate judicial proceedings committee, said it has been estimated that maryland is facing a potential liability between 3 billion and 4 billion. smith, a democrat, noted that lawmakers approved the 2023 child victims act in response to a long fight to have justice for victims of child sex abuse, where our prior framework barred some of those claims if you were above the age of 38. but what we could never have anticipated was just the sheer volume of cases that ensued, smith said. during debate saturday, lawmakers said about 1,500 cases already have been filed. in addition, another 4,500 cases are known about, lawmakers said, and attorneys for plaintiffs have been in settlement discussions with maryland attorney general anthony browns office. sen. justin ready, a republican who is the senate minority whip, said the state liability could potentially be even higher than the estimate cited by smith. we just spent all session wrestling with a 3 billion deficit, which is a huge deficit, and weve been fighting about that and debating it discussing it just one settlement from this very well could end up being that entire amount, and that is not the end of this, ready said. sen. chris west said he doubted the provision in the bill that would limit someone to only sue for one individual case, rather than for each incident of abuse, would survive a court challenge, based on prior rulings by the maryland supreme court. if the supreme court follows the guidance of prior supreme court decisions, they will hold that our attempt to deny people the right to file cases to recover for multiple occurrences is unconstitutional, because those rights for the past two years have been vested, west, a republican, said. the people have had the right to file those cases. smith told reporters on friday that he believed a settlement is the optimal solution here. were hoping that the attorney general and the plaintiffs can get together and work out a settlement, smith said. maryland lawmakers passed the child victims act in the immediate aftermath of a scathing investigative report by the attorney generals office that revealed widespread abuse within the archdiocese of baltimore. before its passage, victims couldnt sue after they turned 38. the law change prompted the archdiocese to file for bankruptcy to protect its assets. the maryland supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the law in a 4-3 ruling in february. the measure approved saturday also would cap attorneys fees at 20 for cases that settle out of court and 25 for cases resolved in court. the senate voted 36-7 for the bill on saturday, and the house voted 92-40 for the bill a short time later, sending the bill to the governor.

  Title: Los Angeles County plans historic $4 billion payout for sex abuse claims
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-05 14:04:09)
  Content: los angeles county has agreed to pay 4 billion to settle more than 6,800 claims of sexual abuse alleged to have taken place in its juvenile facilities and foster care system for decades. the tentative agreement, announced by the county on friday, is the largest sexual abuse settlement of its kind, according to attorneys for the plaintiffs, and the largest financial settlement in the history of the county, its chief executive, fesia davenport, said in a statement. on behalf of the county, i apologize wholeheartedly to everyone who was harmed by these reprehensible acts, davenport said. the historic scope of this settlement makes clear that we are committed to helping the survivors recover and rebuild their lives and to making and enforcing the systemic changes needed to keep young people safe. the settlement, which must now be approved by the los angeles county claims board and board of supervisors, comes after a state law went into effect in 2020 that waived the statute of limitations for a three-year window for victims of childhood sexual abuse to file a civil suit. if approved, the amount given to the thousands of individuals who filed claims will be determined by a team of experts, the county said. adam slater, a lead attorney on the case who represented 3,860 survivors, said news of the proposed deal is bittersweet in a statement posted on social media. however, the settlement hopefully gives them some measure of justice and provides them with some closure, he said. the settlement covers claims going back to 1959, though the majority are from 1980 to 2000, the county said. many are alleged to have taken place at the county-run maclaren childrens center, which opened in the city of el monte in 1961 as a shelter for children awaiting foster home placement. patrick mcnicholas, another lead attorney whose firm represented 1,200 victims, told the washington post a number of children have come forward over the years alleging to have suffered physical and sexual abuse from the staff. these were minors who were depending on the government to protect them, and instead of protecting them, they injured them a second time, he said. if approved, the settlement would dwarf previous sexual abuse payouts, including the nearly 2.5 billion settlement by the boy scouts of america to the more than 84,000 people who allege they were sexually abused as children by boy scout leaders, as well as the more than 1 billion paid by the university of southern california to settle lawsuits related to george tyndall, a gynecologist accused of sexually abusing patients at the student health center. it would also surpass the 880 million that the archdiocese of los angeles agreed to pay in 2024 to cover more than 1,300 claims of childhood sexual abuse, as well as the 500 million that michigan state university agreed to pay in 2018 to the hundreds of alleged victims of sports physician larry nassar. the county said the settlement will have a significant impact on the countys budget for years to come, at a time when it is still recovering from the deadly palisades and eaton wildfires, the most destructive blazes in the countys history. local and state governments are also grappling with the impact of cuts to federal agencies that the trump administration has enacted. the financing of the settlement will require annual payments totaling hundreds of millions of dollars through 2030, the county said, and substantial continuing annual payments through fiscal year 2050-2051. mcnicholas said the structured five-year payment plan will allow the county to remain fiscally responsible. the process took over a year, and it was acrimonious at times, and it was emotional, he said. but at the end, we had to balance the interests of all these survivors with the goal of achieving restorative justice with the countys ability to pay, he said. many of the survivors are still struggling as adults in the aftermath of their abuse, grappling with their sense of safety and well-being, as well as their identity and self-esteem, mcnicholas said. for the victims, a settlement of this size and scope is more than just monetary compensation, he added. societal recognition, especially from a governmental body, goes a long way toward closure and the healing process, which will be a lifelong journey, mcnicholas said. maclaren childrens center was permanently closed in 2003, but investigations into the sexual abuse allegations are still ongoing, according to the county. two cases have been referred to the los angeles district attorney for possible prosecution. the countys risk management team is also proposing a number of reforms, including creating a countywide hotline for reporting child sexual abuse allegations against county employees and developing a system for expedited investigations and independent review by outside experts, it said.

jurors found that energy giant texaco, acquired by chevron in 2001, had for decades violated louisiana regulations governing coastal resources by failing to restore wetlands impacted by dredging canals, drilling wells and billions of gallons of wastewater dumped into the marsh. the jury awarded 575 million to compensate for land loss, 161 million to compensate for contamination and 8 million for abandoned equipment. no company is big enough to ignore the law, no company is big enough to walk away scot-free, the plaintiffs lead attorney john carmouche told jurors during closing arguments. a 1978 louisiana coastal management law mandated that sites used by oil companies be cleared, revegetated, detoxified, and otherwise restored as near as practicable to their original condition after operations ended. older operations sites that continued to be used were not exempt and companies were expected to apply for proper permits. but the oil company did not obtain proper permits and failed to clean up its mess, leading to contamination from wastewater stored unsafely or dumped directly into the marsh, the lawsuit said. the company also failed to follow known best practices for decades since it began operating in the area in the 1940s, expert witnesses for the plaintiffs testified. the company chose profits over the marsh and allowed the environmental degradation caused by its operations to fester and spread, carmouche said. how are oil companies contributing to louisianas land loss? the lawsuit against chevron was filed in 2013 by plaquemines parish, a rural district in louisiana straddling the final leg of the mississippi river heading into the gulf of mexico, also referred to as the gulf of america as declared by president donald trump. louisianas coastal parishes have lost more than 2,000 square miles 5,180 square kilometers of land over the past century, according to the u.s. geological survey, which has also identified oil and gas infrastructure as a significant cause. the state could lose another 3,000 square miles 7,770 square kilometers in the coming decades, its coastal protection agency has warned. thousands of miles of canals cut through the wetlands by oil companies weakens them and exacerbates the impacts of sea level rise. industrial wastewater from oil production degrades the surrounding soil and vegetation. the torn up wetlands leave south louisiana home to some of the nations biggest ports and key energy sector infrastructure - more vulnerable to flooding and destruction from extreme weather events like hurricanes. chevrons lead attorney, mike phillips, said the company had operated lawfully and blamed land loss in louisiana on other factors, namely the extensive levee system that blocks the mississippi river from depositing land regenerating sediment a widely acknowledged cause of coastal erosion. the way to solve the land loss problem is not suing oil companies, its reconnecting the mississippi river with the delta, phillips said during closing arguments. yet the lawsuit held the company responsible for exacerbating and accelerating land loss in louisiana, rather than being its sole cause. chevron also challenged the costly wetlands restoration project proposed by the parish, which involved removing large amounts of contaminated soil and filling in the swaths fragmented wetlands eroded over the past century. the company said the plan was impractical and designed to inflate the damages rather than lead to real world implementation. attorney jimmy faircloth, jr., who represented the state of louisiana, which has backed plaquemines and other local governments in their lawsuits against oil companies, told jurors from the parish that chevron was telling them their community was not worth preserving. our communities are built on coast, our families raised on coast, our children go to school on coast, faircloth said. the state of louisiana will not surrender the coast, its for the good of the state that the coast be maintained. what does this mean for future litigation against oil companies? carmouche, a well-connected attorney, and his firm talbot, carmouche marcello have been responsible for bringing many of the lawsuits against oil companies in the state. louisianas economy has long been heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry and the industry holds significant political power. even so, louisianas staunchly pro-industry gov. jeff landry has supported the lawsuits, including bringing the state on board during his tenure as attorney general. oil companies have fought tooth and nail to quash the litigation, including unsuccessfully lobbying louisianas legislature to pass a law to invalidate the claims. chevron and other firms also repeatedly tried to move the lawsuits into federal court where they believed they would find a more sympathetic audience. but the heavy price chevron is set to pay could hasten other firms to seek settlements in the dozens of other lawsuits across louisiana. plaquemines alone has 20 other cases pending against oil companies. the state is running out of money to support its ambitious coastal restoration plans, which have been fueled by soon-expiring settlement funds from the deepwater horizon oil spill, and supporters of the litigation say payouts could provide a much-needed injection of funds.

  Content: this is an edition of the atlantic daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. sign up for it here. late last month, jonathan braun was arrested on allegations of shoving a 3-year-old, causing a red mark on his back and substantial pain. this is only his latest brush with the law over the past four years. he was banned by federal and new york state judges from working in debt collection fined 20 million and accused of punching his wife and father-in-law, groping a nanny, and attacking a nurse with an iv-bag holder. he also allegedly threatened a man at his synagogue who asked him to pipe down during services. this crime spree is stunning, but what makes it national news is that it has all happened since 2021, when president donald trump commuted brauns 10-year prison sentence for smuggling marijuana. braun, granted clemency during the last hours of trumps first term as president, is one of many recipients of a trump pardon who has found himself back in trouble with the law. some of them are people convicted of serious offenses on january 6, 2021, and then pardoned at the outset of trumps second term in office. despite trumps depiction of the rioters as peace-loving patriots, more than a few of them have proved to be repeat offenders. braun, who is now back in prison , is not the only first-term recipient of clemency to be rearrested. eli weinstein, a convicted ponzi schemer who received a last-minute 2021 commutation, was convicted on march 31 in a 41 million fraud case. philip esformes, whose sentence for his role in a 1.3 billion medicare fraud was commuted in 2020, was arrested last year on domestic-violence-related charges, but the state dropped them a month later. the rapper kodak black has also been repeatedly arrested since receiving a commutation. but the group of people convicted in connection with january 6 has been particularly likely to have found more trouble. former proud boys leader enrique tarrio, who was sentenced to 22 years for seditious conspiracy and other crimes, was arrested for assault just a month after being pardonedat the capitol, no less. d.c. prosecutors declined to pursue charges. he also tried unsuccessfully to stir up conflict at a conference of trump critics in february. matthew huttle, an indiana man who received a pardon for entering the capitol on january 6, was fatally shot by a deputy on january 27 after reaching for a gun. emily hernandez, a missouri woman, was convicted for causing a fatal drunk-driving crash in 2022 the sentencing came days after her pardon for january 6 offenses. andrew taake of texas was pardoned in january, then arrested in february on an outstanding charge for allegedly sending explicit messages to an undercover cop he believed was an underage girl. its not just that clemency recipients have been accused of crimes since their pardons theyve also tried to use the pardons to get off for other offenses. edward kelley argued that his pardon from trump for january 6 also covered his plot to kill the fbi agents who investigated him a judge disagreed. daniel ball said that charges of illegally possessing a gun should be thrown out because the weapon was discovered in a search related to now-pardoned january 6 charges, and the acting u.s. attorney agreed , but dan wilson, a pardoned capitol rioter who made a similar argument, had less luck with a federal appeals court. other defendants have made similar claims, with varying results . david daniel, who was charged with producing and possessing child pornography, also argued that a search that turned up the material was invalid because of his january 6 pardon, but the u.s. attorney in the case disagreed . daniel has pleaded not guilty to the charges. seeing so many people who received pardons get back in trouble with the law should be deeply embarrassing for trumpthough to be fair, pardoning people for a violent assault on the capitol should have been embarrassing to him as well. he is not the first president to issue clemency for personal reasons, but presidential administrations usually carefully administer commutations and pardons, in part to avoid recidivism. the trump white house, however, has shown little regard for the process. last month, it fired justice department pardon attorney elizabeth oyer after she opposed restoring gun rights for the actor mel gibson, then tried to block her from testifying to congress. trump, the first convicted felon to serve as president, has long claimed that he will restore law and order in america, but his definition is highly selective. some of the presidents commutations and pardons are simply favors granted to people who are well connected, but in the case of the january 6 commutations, he was eager to reward loyalty and to make a political point that he and they had both been subjects of political persecution. this creates a nauseating contrast with statements this week in which administration officials have claimed that kilmar abrego garcia, a maryland resident living under protected legal status who was deported to el salvador, is a terrorist, despite a total lack of evidence and despite the fact that the government has previously acknowledged his deportation was an administrative error . the search for some offense to pin on abrego garcia is also being done to make a political point. if trump is eager to find dangerous criminals, he could do so more easily by looking at his pardon list. related here are four new stories from the atlantic todays news 1. a federal judge found probable cause to hold the trump administration in contempt over its willful disregard of his

  Content: by kanishka singh reuters - los angeles county said on friday it reached a 4 billion tentative agreement to settle more than 6,800 sexual abuse claims dating back to 1959, calling it the costliest financial settlement in the countys history. the deal will settle lawsuits filed by thousands who alleged sexual abuse and mistreatment in foster care and juvenile detention facilities. it is subject to approval by the la county claims board and the board of supervisors, la county said in a statement. on behalf of the county, i apologize wholeheartedly to everyone who was harmed by these reprehensible acts, the countys chief executive officer, fesia davenport, said. the historic scope of this settlement makes clear that we are committed to helping the survivors recover and rebuild their lives and to making and enforcing the systemic changes needed to keep young people safe. the majority of the claims date from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s and are alleged to have happened at probation department facilities and at the maclaren childrens center, which was permanently closed in 2003, la county said. the financing will require annual payments totaling hundreds of millions of dollars through 2030 and substantial continuing annual payments through fiscal year 2050-51. the countys juvenile halls and camps came under scrutiny following reports of abuse and unsafe conditions, including by the u.s. department of justice in 2007, which forced la county probation into federal oversight for six years, according to an abc news affiliate. reporting by kanishka singh in washington editing by leslie adler

  Title: In unprecedented payout, L.A. County will settle sex abuse claims for $4 billion - Los Angeles Times
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-04 22:24:33)
  Content: los angeles county plans to pay 4 billion to settle nearly 7,000 claims of childhood sexual abuse that allegedly occurred inside its juvenile facilities and foster homes, dwarfing the largest sex abuse settlements in u.s. history. the mammoth settlement, which still needs to be approved by both the county claims board and county supervisors, is a billion dollars more than what county officials had anticipated as the worst-case scenario to resolve a flurry of lawsuits and far more than other organizations notorious for allowing unchecked sex abuse have paid victims. the boy scouts of america, by comparison, agreed to pay 2.46 billion. the archdiocese of los angeles has paid out about 1.5 billion for alleged abuse at the hands of catholic priests. victims of usc gynecologist george tyndall got 1.1 billion. michigan state university paid 500 million to victims of team doctor larry nassar. this is the largest sex abuse settlement in history, said adam slater, a lead attorney in both the l.a. county and boy scouts settlements. the unprecedented settlement arose from assembly bill 218, a 2020 state law that gave victims of childhood sexual abuse a new window to sue, even though the statute of limitations had expired. many california counties, which are responsible for the care of children in foster homes and juvenile halls, saw an uptick in lawsuits. for l.a. county, it was a deluge that still hasnt stopped. thousands of men and women came forward to say they had been molested or raped by probation officials decades ago while incarcerated as children in the countys sprawling network of juvenile halls and camps. thousands more alleged sexual abuse at the now-shuttered maclaren childrens center, a county-run home for foster children that plaintiffs attorneys have compared to a house of horrors. a report found that the facility went decades without doing criminal background checks on its staff. when i heard the news, it felt like my heart had a door and it slammed shut, said maryalice ashbrook, 65, who was sent to maclaren as an 8-year-old in the early 1960s. ive gone to great lengths to block this out, and still, i deal with reoccurring nightmares. both ashbrook and her friend shirley bodkin, 58, who filed some of the earliest ab 218 cases against l.a. county, said the hall where they spent part of their childhoods was rife with predatory staff. im in total shock, said bodkin, who recalled being drugged, beaten and sexually abused in bathtubs and closets. ive been waiting all these years for this outcome. taken together, the thousands of lawsuits, most of which involve alleged abuse from the 1980s through the 2000s, paint a picture of a government that failed to intervene as its facilities turned into hunting grounds for predators, who held immense power over the children in their custody. on behalf of the county, i apologize wholeheartedly to everyone who was harmed by these reprehensible acts, said l.a. county chief executive officer fesia davenport in a statement. she said the county has worked in recent years to crack down on sexual abuse of minors. improvements touted by the county include bolstering the vetting of foster parents and probation staffers and winding down the use of group homes like maclaren childrens center. davenport made headlines in 2023 when she estimated in a public budget hearing that the county could be looking at 1.6 billion to 3 billion in liability for the roughly 3,000 sex abuse claims it expected. her estimate was met with shock and a dash of skepticism from seasoned attorneys suing the county, who said it would blow any previous sex abuse payout out of the water. since then, thousands of additional victims have sued, with more coming forward every month. in addition to creating a three-year window for victims, which closed at the end of 2023, the new state law let plaintiffs sue if they were under the age of 40 or had recently discovered the abuse they suffered as children. the county said the 4-billion settlement covers most but not all of the childhood sexual abuse lawsuits. some attorneys were not willing to participate in the global mediation process, and negotiations are underway with plaintiffs in those cases, according to the county. the settlement does not include any of the 150 cases filed by manly, stewart finaldi, one of the most high-profile sex-abuse law firms negotiating with the county, according to courtney thom, a partner with the firm. resolving those cases could end up costing the county millions more. patrick mcnicholas, whose law firm is representing 1,200 plaintiffs, said he was mindful during settlement discussions to reach for a number that would bring some justice to the thousands of victims without bankrupting the county, which serves as the regions social safety net. he reasoned that the government could stay solvent with a 4-billion payout and yet it was still the largest sex abuse payout he has ever heard of. this is a historic settlement, he said. it recognizes the horrific harm that has been done. the 4-billion payout will be a huge blow to a county already in tumultuous financial waters, thanks to threats of funding cuts from the trump white house and the cost of recovering from the devastating palisades and eaton wildfires. davenport has warned that the county government, which has a roughly 49-billion budget, could face a fiscal crisis unless hiring is frozen. county officials have said the money will come from draining the countys rainy day fund and taking out bonds. the county is expected to owe hundreds of millions of dollars in interest on those bonds, which have to be paid off by 2051. the county budget will also need to be slashed, davenport warned department heads in a friday email. it is unprecedented by all accounts, she wrote. after you recover from the shock of the settlement amount and how it will impact your budgets, we must regain focus and turn towards the work ahead of us. the county said it will pay out the money between january 2026 and jan. 30, 2030, providing the billions to independent allocators who will decide how to divvy it up among the roughly 6,800 plaintiffs. we hope that this settlement, once approved, can bring some measure of healing to those who experienced abuse and help them in rebuilding their lives, the board of supervisors, which is expected to approve the settlement later this month, wrote in a joint statement. there have been few criminal prosecutions of county staffers accused of abuse in the lawsuits. the probation department presented the l.a. county district attorneys office with evidence against two staff members, thomas jackson and altovise abner, in december 2023. the status of those cases was not immediately available. some of the employees accused of being the most prolific abusers were on the county payroll until recently. jackson resigned from the probation department in fall 2023, ending a 33-year career during which at least 20 women accused him of sexually abused them when they were girls.

  Title: Under Trump, Texas firm pushes to restart Santa Barbara oil drilling. Is it skirting California laws?
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-06 10:00:14)
  Content: more than 50 years ago, a catastrophic oil spill along santa barbaras coastline served to galvanize the modern environmental movement and also helped to usher in one of the states strongest conservation laws the california coastal act. now, as the trump administration seeks to encourage oil and gas production within federal lands and waters, that watershed conservation law is being tested along the same stretch of coastline and in a way it never has before. for months, a texas-based oil company has rebuffed the authority of the california coastal commission the body tasked with enforcing the act and has instead pushed forward with controversial plans to revive oil production off the gaviota coast. ten years after another spill brought oil production here to a halt, sable offshore corp. has begun repairing and upgrading the network of oil pipelines responsible for that 2015 spill, without coastal commission approval and ignoring the commissions repeated demands to stop its work, officials say. crews bag oiled sand and kelp at refugio state beach in may 2015, after a ruptured pipeline near santa barbara leaked an estimated 140,000 gallons of crude oil. al seib los angeles times this is the first time in the agencys history that weve had a party blatantly ignore a cease and desist order like this and refuse to submit a permit application, cassidy teufel, deputy director of the california coastal commission, told a packed town hall recently. aggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health and science. explore the section sable has accused the commission of overreach and insists that it has acquired the necessary approvals for its work. the company intends to revive operations at three oil platforms known as the santa ynez unit, which connects to pipelines that have been the focus of the ongoing repair work after a corroded section of those pipes ruptured near refugio state beach in 2015. that pipeline failure, which occurred under different ownership, spewed an estimated 140,000 gallons of crude oil, harmed hundreds of miles of coastline and cost millions to clean up. in a new report, coastal commission staff allege that sables activities which include excavation, grading, removing vegetation and placing cement bags on the seafloor have adversely impacted, and continue to adversely impact, coastal resources as a result of sables outright refusal to comply with the coastal act. the report recommends that commissioners fine sable almost 15 million, issue another cease and desist order for all development along the pipelines and require restoration work. the requested sanctions will be considered next week at a public hearing one of the first such venues for citizens to weigh in on reactivation of the offshore oil rigs and how that could affect the local environment, which has long concerned santa barbara residents and climate activists. sable insists it does not need to comply with the latest coastal commission requests. the repair and maintenance work done to ensure the safe condition of the santa ynez unit and onshore pipelines was fully authorized by coastal development permits previously approved by the california coastal commission and santa barbara county, steve rusch, sables vice president of environmental and governmental affairs, said in a prepared statement. commission staffs unreasonable overreach is an attempt to exert influence over the planned restart of the santa ynez unit oil production operations. in a statement of defense submitted to the coastal commission, sable noted that due to updated requirements, this pipeline will meet more stringent environmental and safety requirements than any other pipeline in the state. the company called the commissions findings on environmental impacts exaggerated, and noted that it has implemented several construction best management practices to limit impacts to coastal resources, biological resources, and archaeological resources, sable wrote. cleanup workers pile bags of oil-soaked sand at refugio state beach in goleta after a 2015 oil pipeline rupture. mel melcon los angeles times so whos in charge of such projects? if sable succeeds in restarting operations, it would mark a surprising reversal for californias oil and gas industry in recent years, as climate-focused policies have slowly reduced the states production of fossil fuels. the houston-based company estimates that once the santa ynez unit is fully online, it could produce an estimated 28,000 barrels of oil a day, according to an investor presentation. the unit has three offshore platforms hondo, harmony and heritage located in federal waters a few miles off the coast. these platforms are connected to the las flores canyon processing facility, inland from el capitan state beach, and other distribution lines that run onshore. the 2015 refugio oil spill was caused by the rupture of a buried onshore pipeline. sable has said it anticipates restarting offshore oil production in the second quarter this year, but the company acknowledges that some regulatory and oversight hurdles remain. most notably, its restart plan must be approved by the state fire marshal. though sable has already cleared some of that agencys major regulatory steps, state fire marshal daniel berlant has said the companys final restart plan wouldnt be approved without agreement from a handful of other state agencies, including the coastal commission. before we would ever sign off on a pipeline, we will make sure that each of these departments has agreed that all of the rules have been followed, berlant said at the march town hall. berlant also assured santa barbarans that since the 2015 spill, the fire marshals office has implemented more stringent standards for oil infrastructure, which are part of sables plan. he said his office requires 67 new conditions focused on safety and corrosion protection, stricter and more frequent monitoring and repair standards. sable, however, has most heavily relied on recent approval from santa barbara county planning development, which in october said the company could proceed with its corrosion repair work under the pipelines original county permit from the 1980s. the company contends it is still relevant because its work is only repairing and maintaining an existing pipeline, not constructing new infrastructure. after concern from the coastal commission and environmental groups, county officials confirmed its position in february, concluding that sables repair work on the corroded pipeline is authorized by the existing permits . and was analyzed in the prior environmental impact reportenvironmental impact statement. a worker cleans oil from the rocks and beach at refugio state beach in goleta, calif. in 2015. mark ralstonafp via getty images coastal commission staff have questioned how a permit from nearly 40 years ago can adequately take into account current technology, requirements to remedy corrosion issues and environmental conditions. the removal of the pipelines insulation and implementation of this new strategy for managing corrosion risk represents such a fundamental shift in the pipelines design and operation that resuming operations under this new system would not be consistent with the existing permit, the staff report said. it also argues that old permits dont take into account current habitats or sensitive species in the area, including those newly considered endangered or threatened, such as the steelhead, the tidewater goby and the california red-legged frog. climate environment is california government considering oil refinery takeovers? yes, it is as oil companies shut down refineries, california policymakers are weighing whether the state should get into the refinery business to ensure steady supplies. an industry group says its not so simple. ultimately, the matter may be determined in court. in february, sable sued the coastal commission claiming it doesnt have the authority to oversee its work. sables representatives have told us that theyll only stop if a court makes them, so weve been working with the attorney generals office for the past month to move in that direction, teufel said at a town hall last month in santa barbara. the event drew hundreds of attendees clearly divided between those donning sable hats and others holding signs that read, no polluting pipeline and no coastal permit, no restart. but as of yet, california atty. gen. rob bonta hasnt weighed in. a spokesperson for the office declined to respond to questions from the times, referring inquiries to the coastal commission. a controversial legacy since 1969, when the blowout of on an offshore oil platform spewed more than 3 million gallons of crude oil into the santa barbara channel and devastated the coastline, environmentalists have fought to shut down offshore oil rigs along the gaviota coast. in their view, sables behavior has been beyond the pale. so far this has been happening with no environmental review, said alex katz, the executive director of the the environmental defense center, which was founded after the 1969 spill. for a project thats this big and has this much risk, its very strange. at the same time, other residents see economic value in oil extraction. 1 2 3 1. men in boats and on shore gather in straw being used to soak up oil in santa barbara harbor. a boom helps contain the worst of the oil slick, which has stained 30 miles of coastline. this photo was published in the feb. 10, 1969 los angeles times. the santa barbara oil spill of 1969 don cormierlos angeles times 2. cormorants bill is held by rubber band during bath to remove oil after the santa barbara oil spill. this photo was published in the feb. 10, 1969 los angeles times. mary framptonlos angeles times 3. workman dave kirkwood sprays live steam rocks at the harbor at santa barbara breakwater to clear oil smears. this photo was published in the feb. 10, 1969 los angeles times. the santa barbara oil spill of 1969 don cormierlos angeles times santa barbara county supervisor bob nelson has called much of the concern around the pipeline political theater. he said he generally agrees that sable has the necessary permits to restart oil production, and noted that local oil is better than the alternative, especially when theres still demand for such fuel. if you really cared about climate change, youd want to use this oil, nelson said in an interview, arguing that its better to use local resources than oil shipped from around the world, where there are likely fewer environmental regulations and no local tax revenue or jobs. sable has reported it expects the project to initially generate 5 million a year in new taxes for the county and, upon restart, would support an additional 300 jobs. at the town hall last month, assemblymember gregg hart d-santa barbara called on californias attorney general to get involved in this process to uphold the states environmental laws, noting that there are clear risks, as with any offshore drilling project. it is a false choice to say we have to choose between protecting our environment and growing our economy, hart said at the packed hearing that included representatives from at least eight state agencies. we have experience here in this community of the tragedies that come from companies that dont operate responsibly. we have some serious concerns about whats being proposed with the sable pipeline. some of those state agencies, including the california department of fish and wildlife, the state water resources control board and the california department of parks and recreation, have also raised concerns about sables work. the regional water board in december issued sable a noncompliance notice for unauthorized discharge into waterways, while wildlife officials alerted the company of a potential fish and game code violation. sables response to those issues remain under review. yet, the full extent of completed or possible environmental damage from this project remains unclear, the coastal commission argues, because sable hasnt shared detailed plans or applied for permits. and thats a precedent that should be concerning for all californians, said linda krop, chief counsel for the environmental defense center. this is the biggest threat to the california coast, krop said. they should not be allowed to operate when theyre violating state laws. staff writer tony briscoe contributed to this report.

  Title: Coca-Cola under fire after bombshell report exposes ties to controversial industry: 'The cost is irreversible damage to our children's health'
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-22 11:30:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying the concept of Externalities, the article highlights how the social costs of fracking and plastic production (environmental damage, health issues) are not fully borne by the companies involved (Coca-Cola, Unilever, etc.). The text states, 'the fracking process creates environmental damage and can significantly impact local communities' and mentions 'irreversible damage to our childrens health'. This suggests a market failure where the price of plastic does not reflect its true cost to society, leading to overproduction and consumption.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Coca-Cola's 'World Without Waste' initiative but then states 'its link to fracking operations suggests it is still looking to create new plastics.' This juxtaposition creates a contradiction. What are the specific mechanisms preventing Coca-Cola from fully transitioning to recycled plastics, and could these mechanisms be related to the profitability of fracking-derived plastics?
