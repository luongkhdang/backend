  Title: Challenge to ACA preventive-care panel draws skepticism from Supreme Court
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-21 19:59:15)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: This case can be interpreted through the lens of Separation of Powers doctrine. The article highlights the central question of whether the Preventive Services Task Force's members are 'principal officers' requiring presidential appointment and Senate approval, or 'inferior officers' who can be appointed by department heads. The text states, 'the constitutions appointment clause requires the president to appoint and get senate approval for principal officers...but allows congress to vest authority in department heads and other officials to appoint inferior officers.' This directly reflects the core concern of the Separation of Powers: preventing any one branch from accumulating excessive power. The debate over the task force's independence ('their coverage mandates are neither directed nor supervised by the secretary of health and human services') suggests a potential blurring of lines between the executive and legislative branches, as the task force's recommendations have significant policy implications. This raises concerns about accountability and the potential for unchecked power within the administrative state.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions the plaintiffs' objection to 'being forced to offer pre-exposure medications intended to prevent the spread of hiv among at-risk populations' because they believe 'the medications encourage and facilitate homosexual behavior.' This framing of HIV prevention as enabling 'homosexual behavior' is a noteworthy textual clue. Why does the article include this specific detail about the plaintiffs' beliefs? Could this inclusion be intended to subtly influence the reader's perception of the plaintiffs' motives, potentially framing them as discriminatory or biased, thereby undermining their legal arguments? What are the broader implications of allowing religious beliefs to dictate healthcare coverage decisions, particularly concerning public health initiatives?; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article focuses on the legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act, specifically the preventive care mandate. The fact that the Supreme Court is hearing this case, and the details of the arguments presented ('the justices sharply questioned an attorney for the challengers,' 'that argument seemed to resonate with some justices'), indicate that the issue is gaining prominence in the public discourse. The article also mentions previous unsuccessful attempts to overturn the ACA ('conservatives have tried unsuccessfully to overturn the law several times in recent years'). This repeated litigation, as reported in the media, keeps the ACA and its provisions on the public agenda, potentially influencing public opinion and future policy decisions. The framing of the issue – whether it's about religious freedom, executive power, or healthcare access – can further shape how the public perceives the ACA and its impact.; Intriguing_angles: The article states that 'the appeals court did not invalidate the task forces mandates universally but only as they applied to the plaintiffs.' This limited ruling is intriguing. Why did the appeals court choose to restrict the scope of its decision in this way? Could this suggest a strategic compromise, perhaps reflecting differing views among the judges or a desire to avoid a broader disruption of the healthcare system? What are the potential implications of this limited ruling for other individuals or organizations who may share similar objections to the preventive care mandates?

    - Christian-owned business:
      > Snippet: a lawsuit brought by a christian-owned business and individuals argued that the mandates were unenforceable
  Content: the supreme court appeared skeptical monday of a challenge to a section of the affordable care act that requires health plans to provide no-cost preventive care such as cancer screenings, immunizations and contraception to millions of americans. a lawsuit brought by a christian-owned business and individuals argued that the mandates were unenforceable because members of the expert committee that decides what measures health plans must cover were improperly appointed. health-care providers and nonprofit organizations say the closely watched case could affect critical health services for many americans who might otherwise not have access to them. during oral argument monday, the justices sharply questioned an attorney for the challengers, who said the preventive services task force was unconstitutional because its members should have been appointed by the president and approved by the senate. the plaintiffs sued over the preventive-care provision because they objected to being forced to offer pre-exposure medications intended to prevent the spread of hiv among at-risk populations. the plaintiffs contend that the medications encourage and facilitate homosexual behavior, which they say conflicts with their religious beliefs. the constitutions appointment clause requires the president to appoint and get senate approval for principal officers such as cabinet secretaries, federal judges and ambassadors, but allows congress to vest authority in department heads and other officials to appoint inferior officers. since 2023, the health and human services secretary has made appointments to the 16-member preventive services task force. jonathan mitchell, an attorney for the challengers, argued that task force members were principal officers, drawing skepticism from justice brett m. kavanaugh and some of his colleagues. your theory, i think, depends on us treating the task force as this massively important agency that operates with unreviewable authority, kavanaugh said. normally, before that kind of thing would happen, congress would have provided stronger indications. hashim mooppan, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices that task force members are inferior officers since they can be fired at will by the secretary of the department of health and human services, who also has supervisory authority of the panel and decides when its recommendations take effect. they are subject to ample supervision by the secretary, mooppan said. mitchell keyed in on another section of the law that states that the task forces recommendations must be independent, to the extent practicable and free from political pressure, maintaining that this language indicates that task force members operate with the type of independence that requires senate confirmation. they cannot be inferior officers because their coverage mandates are neither directed nor supervised by the secretary of health and human services or by anyone else who has been appointed as a principal officer, mitchell said. that argument seemed to resonate with some justices. justice samuel a. alito jr., for example, questioned how much authority the hhs secretary really has over the task force. if the task force rates something a or b, then thats it, alito said. even if the members are removable at will, the only way you can get around that is through some really jerry-built arguments. a texas district court originally sided with the challengers, ruling that the task force was unconstitutional and that all mandates it had imposed since 201o were invalid. the government appealed, and the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit affirmed the district courts ruling with one major caveat. the appeals court did not invalidate the task forces mandates universally but only as they applied to the plaintiffs. both the plaintiffs and the government then asked the supreme court to take up the case, with the government saying the lower-court decisions could allow other plaintiffs to seek a nationwide ruling that would invalidate the preventive-care provision. nicholas bagley, an expert in administrative and health law at the university of michigan law school, said there appeared to be a small chance the justices might kick the case back to the 5th circuit to clear up one question whether congress had properly vested the hhs secretary with the ability to appoint task force members. there were at least some justices interested in remanding, bagley said. but it seems likely the government will emerge with a partial victory, if not more than that. the case is just the latest to put the affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare, in the legal crosshairs. conservatives have tried unsuccessfully to overturn the law several times in recent years. in a landmark ruling in 2012, the supreme court upheld its legality.

  Content: more older adults are staying in the workforce. as people live longer, many older adults are forgoing retirement at the traditional age of 65. while many want to continue working to stay engaged and connected, others can not afford any alternative. today, over 11 million older adults are in the workforce. by 2030, when all baby boomers are 65 and older, nearly 10 of the workforce will comprise older adults. with significant demographic changes already at play in the five-generation workforce, finding a place to work into older age is more relevant than ever. seniorly, a digital senior living directory platform, analyzed data from the bureau of labor statistics, the census bureau, and the federation of tax administrators to rank the best and worst states plus the district of columbia, for older workers. after factoring in a states median income, income tax, remote work policies, labor force participation, business growth rate, and age-related workplace discrimination, states in the northeast and west were rated highest as the best places for older adults to work, while southern states were at the bottom. washington topped the list due to its strong business environment, with no personal income tax and the highest rate of new business growth last year 88.6, according to the report. it also has a high median income for senior households 63,963 and a strong work-from-home culture 22.4 of older adults are remote. it was followed by new hampshire and alaska. in mississippi, the worst state for older workers, labor participation among older workers was low, and there were 188 complaints of age-based discrimination per 100,000 workers. here are the top 10 best states for older workers here are the top 10 worst states for older workers

  Title: Dodgers collaborate with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami on merchandise again. Here's how to get it
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 11:00:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article highlights how the collaboration between Takashi Murakami and the Dodgers, along with the MLB Tokyo Series, successfully captured public attention. The text states, "the overall success of the tokyo series collection delighted murakami" and "i was surprised by the overwhelming response." This suggests that the media coverage and marketing efforts surrounding the event effectively placed it on the public's agenda, leading to increased interest and demand.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions the merchandise hitting the secondary market for four times the purchase price. This suggests a potential imbalance between supply and demand, and raises the question: Was the limited availability of the merchandise intentional to drive up prices and create hype, and if so, what are the ethical implications of such a strategy?; Intriguing_angles: The article notes Murakami's surprise at the overwhelming response in Japan, stating, "honestly, i had thought baseball wasnt as major a sport in japan these days." This suggests a potential disconnect between the artist's perception and the reality of baseball's popularity in Japan. What other assumptions might be influencing the collaboration, and how might these assumptions affect its long-term success?

  Content: a month ago, dodgers gear festooned with colorful flowers in the unmistakable designs of acclaimed japanese artist takashi murakami sold out in minutes at a pop-up on fairfax avenue. a couple hundred angelenos lined up overnight to purchase gear, generating 40 million. the pop-up, called the mlb tokyo series collection, preceded the two-game, season-opening series in japan between the dodgers and chicago cubs, and items soon hit the secondary market for four times the purchase price. the merchandise was so popular that murakami and the dodgers responded by approximating the famous words of hall of fame cubs shortstop ernie banks lets play two! a new collection presented by complex and fanatics will be available april 28 during japanese heritage night at dodger stadium and the dodger clubhouse store, then can be purchased only online. murakami, 63, will throw out the ceremonial first pitch as he did before an exhibition between the dodgers and yomiuri giants at the tokyo dome on march 15. its been two months since i started practicing for the first pitch in tokyo, but given my age, its not so easy to pick up new skills, murakami said playfully in an interview with the times. still, compared to the first day when i couldnt throw the ball at all, ive improved significantly. my hope this time is to throw the ball without it bouncing. some of the dodgers merchandise created in collaboration with japanese artist takashi murakami is shown. complex murakami is unquestionably adept with a brush, a pen or a computer, creating iconic art that features manga, anime, cartoons and brightly colored anthropomorphic cherry blossoms, mushrooms and assorted flowers. he began delivering commissioned projects for luxury brands and celebrities 20 years ago, and a financial pinnacle came in 2008 when his provocative life-size figure my lonesome cowboy sold for 15.1 million at auction. since then murakami has integrated his art on louis vuitton handbags, a kanye west album cover, and the kid cudi collaboration kids see ghosts. he also had a solo exhibition in 2022 at the broad titled takashi murakami stepping on the tail of a rainbow that included sculpture, painting, wallpaper and immersive installations. now his attention has turned to baseball. the mlb tokyo series collection had his familiar colorful flora sprinkled across jerseys, bats, balls, hoodies, flip-flops and a shohei ohtani bobblehead. the surprise medium might have been collaborating with topps on baseball cards. since 2023, i have been creating trading cards and trading card games with my team, so i felt i approached this project with a good understanding of the context, murakami said. but when we filmed the unboxing event for the topps complex series and tokyo series on youtube, i recognized anew how profound the world of american sports trading cards is, which shook me with excitement. the overall success of the tokyo series collection delighted murakami, who said he remembers playing catch with his father as a child. honestly, i had thought baseball wasnt as major a sport in japan these days, so i was surprised by the overwhelming response, he said. i received messages from childhood friends and was approached by neighbors afterwards, which made me realize that baseball remains the beloved sport among the japanese public. the addition of japanese megastars ohtani, yoshinobu yamamoto and roki sasaki made collaborating with the dodgers a natural. the teams popularity in japan has never been greater. the dodgers are the team hideo nomo joined when he first played major league baseball, overcoming various obstacles, murakami said. his success had a significant impact on japanese players entering the majors, and his achievements are vivid in my memory. shohei ohtani joining the dodgers feels like a fateful story for japanese baseball, and im deeply moved by it. in that sense, i consider myself a dodgers fan. murakami added that he has felt comfortable in l.a. since his exhibition at the museum of contemporary art in 2007-2008. i believe my career as an artist in the contemporary art world took off in los angeles, he said. the moca exhibition, curated by paul schimmel, was pivotal in establishing my career in america. whenever i visit los angeles, i feel a strong connection, as if its my second hometown, with fans saying hello to me around the city. so im especially grateful for this new relationship with the dodgers in los angeles.

  Title: Why Trump Is Standing by Hegseth, for Now
  Source: www.theatlantic.com (2025-04-21 20:40:02)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Principal-Agent Theory, the article highlights the challenges the President (Principal) faces in controlling the Secretary of Defense (Agent). Evidence includes Trump's conditional support ('for now, is willing to support him'), internal speculation about Hegseth's tenure ('speculating about hegseths shelf life'), and external calls for Trump to act ('suggested that trump should remove the secretary'). This suggests the Agent's actions (Signal use, management) create agency loss and monitoring costs for the Principal, forcing a calculation between loyalty, political cost, and effective bureaucratic control.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative demonstrates Agenda-Setting Theory, where unexpected events disrupt the administration's planned focus. The text explicitly states 'signalgate the sequel is not what they had in mind' and describes the White House's prior efforts to push messaging on 'deportations, immigration, even greenland'. The 'revelations rattled washington' and 'talk in washington revolves around' Hegseth, showing how the Signal issue forced itself onto the political agenda, overriding attempts at narrative control and distraction.; Intriguing_angles: The article heavily relies on anonymous sources ('senior white house aides', 'close outside advisers', 'a white house official', etc.) to convey internal speculation, mood ('mood in the west wing has grown dark'), and strategy ('discuss internal strategy'). What might be the motivations of these anonymous sources in leaking this specific information? Could the strategic use of anonymity and attributed roles ('outside allies') be intended to shape the narrative or pressure specific individuals within the administration?; Intriguing_angles: The text presents conflicting descriptions of the situation at the Pentagon, simultaneously calling it 'dysfunction', 'meltdown', and 'disarray', while also including Hegseth's framing of 'changing the defense department' and the White House press secretary's dismissal of 'disarray' as 'fake news' and resistance to 'monumental change'. How does the juxtaposition of these competing frames influence the reader's perception of the events? What political objectives might each framing serve within the context of the ongoing conflict?

  Content: trump is currently supporting his defense secretary, but some in the administration are speculating about how long pete hegseth will last. secretary of defense pete hegseth shared sensitive attack plans in a signal group chat. no, not that onea different one. some of his top pentagon aides have been ousted, but few in the building are sure what they were ousted for, or even by whom. and the talk in washington revolves around who might be on the short list to replace him, even as president donald trump delivered a firm defense of hegseth today while standing a few feet away from a giant bunny. that surreal sightat the white house easter egg roll this morningseemed oddly fitting on a day when the worlds largest military was enveloped in a level of dysfunction that bordered on the comical, except for the hundreds of billions of dollars of fighter jets and tanks involved. an organization dependent on clear lines of communication was in a state of confusion, while questions surrounding hegseths fitness for the post that first surfaced during his contentious confirmation became relevant again. their revival was thanks to revelations about hegseths wider-than-previously-known use of the nongovernmental messaging app signal to communicate sensitive war plans, this time to an audience that included his wife, his brother, and his personal lawyer. the new disclosure, reported yesterday evening by the new york times, prompted the first republican lawmaker to call for hegseths ouster. and it came just days after a meltdown at the pentagon that led to the abrupt departures of several top senior aides, one of whom took the extraordinary step of openly questioning hegseths fitness for his post and calling for his dismissal. read the double standard at the center of the signal debacle trump spoke with hegseth late last night and, for now, is willing to support him, two senior white house aides and three close outside advisers told me on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy. but some in the white house and the pentagon have begun speculating about hegseths shelf life and have even begun circulating the names of possible replacements, according to one of the white house aides and one of the outside allies. the overall mood in the west wing has grown dark. trump and his inner circle are frustrated at having to revisit a damaging storyline that they believe slowed their momentum last month, the sources told me, even as the president remains loath to fire a cabinet member under pressure. here we go again. just a waste of time. he is doing a great job, trump said of hegseth at the easter event, telling reporters that he has great confidence in the secretary of defense. ask the houthis how he is doing. all of last week, the white house had told staffers to hammer home its messaging about deportations, immigration, even greenlandreally, any issue that could distract from an economy left quaking by trumps trade warinducing tariffs. signalgate the sequel is not what they had in mind. read here are the attack plans that trumps advisers shared on signal it was questionable signal use that ignited the first major scandal of the second trump term. the editor in chief of the atlantic, jeffrey goldberg, revealed last month that national security adviser mike waltz had accidentally added him to a signal group chat to coordinate u.s. plans to strike the houthi rebels in yemen. on march 15, hegseth, a former fox news host, used the chat to share details of the houthi strikes, including precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing. the revelations rattled washington, with bipartisan condemnation for the use of an app to share information that could have put u.s. service members lives in jeopardy. but although trump was privately annoyed at the sloppiness, the white house publicly pushed back, making semantic arguments over whether war plans or attack plans were texted and implausibly denying that any classified information had been shared. the president refused to give in to pressure from democrats or the media to fire any of the offending officials. a white house official told me at the time, the last thing he wants to do is give you guys in the media a scalp. since then, trump world has used the phrase no scalps repeatedly. the unlikely rallying cry was texted to me today both by one of the senior officials and by one of the outside advisers the adviser told me that much of trumps inner circle wants to avoid any high-profile firings in the first 100 days of the administration. capitol hill republicans rallied around the administration last month, but this time, one has broken rank. representative don bacon, a prominent member of the house armed services committee, told politico that the chaos now on display at the pentagon is one reason that many hill republicans had been privately uneasy with hegseths nomination in the first place. i had concerns from the get-go because pete hegseth didnt have a lot of experience, said bacon, a former air force general. i like him on fox. but does he have the experience to lead one of the largest organizations in the world? thats a concern. bacon went on to say that although he wasnt making specific recommendations to trump, he found hegseths management unacceptable, and i wouldnt tolerate it if i was in charge. with congress still out for easter break, most other gop lawmakers seem to be lying low and trying to avoid crossing trump by commenting on hegseth. a number of democrats, though, were eager to put out statements calling for hegseths dismissal. how many times does pete hegseth need to leak classified intelligence before donald trump and republicans understand that he isnt only a fcking liar, he is a threat to our national security? senator tammy duckworth, a combat veteran and a member of the armed services committee, wrote on x. read the trump administration accidentally texted me its war plans during his nomination fight earlier this year, hegseth faced questions about his alcohol use, personal conduct, and management ability. that confirmation battle reminded some of the presidents supporters of the push to confirm supreme court justice brett kavanaugh. the maga movement touted hegseths combat experience and threatened holdout senators with primary challengers if they didnt support him. eventually, three gop senatorssusan collins, mitch mcconnell, and lisa murkowskivoted against hegseth. all three, as well as joni ernst and thom tillis, the two republican senators perceived as the key swing votes for hegseth, did not respond to requests for comment today about the latest signal group chat. some of maga worlds biggest stars, including donald trump jr., have rallied to hegseths defense. and the pentagon chief himself blamed his just-fired aides for the negative stories, declaring, big surprise that a few leakers get fired, and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out. were changing the defense department, putting the pentagon back in the hands of warfighters, hegseth told reporters as he stood near his children and the pastel eggs that dotted the white house lawn. slash and burn doesnt work with me. but others in trumps orbit feel that the latest signal story has put hegseth on shaky ground. the times reported that hegseth had shared details about the houthi attack plans with the chat that included his two family members and his lawyer. in this case, hegseth himself launched the chat, a white house official confirmed to me today. its members included hegseths wife, jennifer, a former fox news producer who is not a defense department employee but has often traveled with hegseth overseas and drawn criticism for at times accompanying her husband to meetings with foreign leaders. others in the chat include the secretary of defenses brother phil and his personal lawyer, tim parlatore, a naval reservist. both have pentagon jobs but serve in positions that would not require knowledge of the houthi-strike details. even before this week, the frequent presence of hegseths family had raised eyebrows among some in the pentagon and the white house. a pentagon spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. also in the chat were a number of hegseths closest aidessome of whom were among those abruptly ousted last week. two of them, dan caldwell, a senior advisor, and darin selnick, a deputy chief of staff, were accused, as part of an internal probe, of leaking unauthorized information and were fired and escorted from the pentagon. another top aide, joe kasper, hegseths chief of staff, is being reassigned elsewhere in the pentagon. and yesterday, a fourth recently departed defense department official, john ullyot, wrote in an opinion essay for politico that the pentagon is in disarray under hegseths leadership and suggested that trump should remove the secretary. the last month has been a full-blown meltdown at the pentagonand its becoming a real problem for the administration, ullyot wrote. the purge was as mysterious as it was sudden. in a joint statement on social media, the ousted dod officials declared their confusion as to why they had been fired and who had fired them. hegseth, who has little managerial experience, had already been viewed as somewhat isolated in the pentagon and was now suddenly without some of his senior advisers. read pete hegseth declines to answer the pentagons acting inspector general announced earlier this month that he would review hegseths houthi-strike disclosures in the original signal chat, which included top trump aides. it was unclear today if that probe will broaden to include the second signal conversation. but one of the white house officials i spoke with speculated that other departures could be forthcoming, whether related to the leak probe or to perceived disloyalty to trump. hegseth and trump previously oversaw the firings of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and other top military generals. karoline leavitt, the white house press secretary, declared fake news when asked on fox news today if hegseths job is in jeopardy, and she downplayed any notion that the department of defense is in disarray. this is what happens when the entire pentagon is working against you and working against the monumental change you are trying to implement, she said. one official familiar with the newly discovered chat told me that hegseths aides had previously warned him against using signal, including on his personal phone, to discuss operational details. signal, although encrypted, is not considered as secure as government channels typically used for discussing highly sensitive war planning and combat operations. a number of former pentagon officials have in recent weeks expressed public concern about hegseths use of signal and his leadership. youre seeing the secretary of defense basically fire his entire senior team around him, so its unclear whos sort of keeping the ships running at the staff level, and that is really concerning, sabrina singh, a deputy pentagon press secretary in the biden administration, told me. theres a chaos that is continuing to permeate through the pentagon.

portfolio. but the trio were united, according to one defense official with knowledge of the situation, in the fact that kasper had a deep vendetta against them. kasper issued a memo in late march directing the pentagon to investigate unauthorized disclosures to reporters and to go so far as using lie detector tests if necessary. the three had raised concerns to hegseth about kaspers leadership, and kasper believed they were trying to get him fired, according to the official. those tensions had boiled into shouting matches in the front office, the official said. trump, hegseth

classified information. pentagon officials dan caldwell, left, and darin selnick are being investigated amid the probe. concerned veterans for america department of defense legal experts say the employees dont need to be notified of what theyre accused of doing until the investigation is concluded. being placed on paid leave is not considered a disciplinary decision. its considered a preliminary step to conduct an investigation, so if they think theyre being railroaded or hosed, theyll have some due process opportunity to respond when theres a formal decision, said sean timmons, a legal expert in military and employment law. theyve been humiliated in the media to some extent. however, this happens every day in the federal government. generally speaking, whats happened so far is not necessarily considered discipline. its just considered a security protocol step to suspend their authorization, suspend their access to their emails, and a full, thorough independent investigation can be conducted. the three aides are civilian political appointees, meaning they could be fired at-will regardless of the investigation. but if they are found to have engaged in unauthorized leaking, they could have their security clearances yanked away. there are very few protections when it comes to political appointees versus career civilian staff, said libby jamison, an attorney who specializes in military law. for appointees, there is very broad discretion to be placed on administrative leave or reassigned. colin carroll, chief of staff to deputy secretary of defense stephen

defense information system for security, and then there is an independent review of their eligibility for access to sensitive information. theyll get a chance, potentially, to try to keep their clearance and show that they didnt violate any security clearance protocols when it comes to handling sensitive information, said timmons. if it is found they were leaking information in violation of the rules, and then theres a guideline violation for personal misconduct and for breaching of sensitive information. so they could be possibly criminally prosecuted and certainly terminated from their employment and have their clearance stripped and revoked. or, if the independent officer does not find sufficient evidence to tie them to the leaks, they could return to their positions and maintain clearances. ullyot, meanwhile, said that he had made clear to hegseth from the beginning that he was not interested in being number two to anyone in public affairs. to get the fox news app ullyot ran the public affairs office on an acting basis at the start of the administration, leading a memo that yanked back workspaces for legacy media outlets and reassigned them to conservative networks. ullyot also took a jab at former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mark milley, saying his corpulence set a bad example for pentagon fitness standards. but as his temporary chief role came to a close and sean parnell took the pentagon chief spokesperson job, ullyot said he and hegseth could not come to an agreement on another good fit for me at dod. so i informed him today that i will be leaving at the end of this week. ullyot said he remains one of hegseths strongest supporters. the office of the secretary of defense and the three aides who were placed on leave this week either

  Title: Fears grow SIGNAL leaks make Hegseth top espionage target...
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-23 17:16:37)
  Content: as more develops about the us defense secretary, pete hegseth, and his repeated disclosures of sensitive military intelligence in unsecured signal group chats, there are growing concerns his behavior has weakened the pentagon in the eyes of its foreign adversaries and made him and his entourage a top espionage target. allies, already concerned by donald trumps aggressive tariffs, have also begun to see the us as an intelligence-sharing liability. there are fears that the mounting firings and leak inquiries in hegseths orbit, along with his inability to manage these internal crises, exposes the entire global us war footing especially, if a geopolitical and external crisis comes across his desk. what if a foreign entity, whether it be a state actor or non-state actor, is able to intercept the movements of troops or department personnel, or something like that, capture them and hold them to ransom, said kristofer goldsmith, an iraq war veteran and ceo at task force butler. that kind of thing could very easily happen. earlier in the week, news broke that hegseth had personally created a signal group chat including his wife, brother and about a dozen other people who he then texted highly sensitive information on active strikes in yemen. previously, he discussed similar intelligence in a group chat on the same app, which included top officials in the trump administration and a journalist from the atlantic. former officials serving in national security positions under joe bidens administration also told the guardian on background that the situation is perilous and that hegseth has endangered the secrets of the defense department and the white house. one person said russian and chinese spies were no doubt directly targeting susceptible people in hegseths inner circle. goldsmith, a threat intelligence expert, said there were many scenarios wherein a foreign government could gain access to those chats, without the need to directly compromise hegseths devices. pete hegseth is texting his wife and his wife is posting on instagram, clicks a link, and gets malware on her phone, said goldsmith, describing a hypothetical scenario. then the chinese or the iranians or the russians just happen to be like, oh, shit, weve got mrs hegseth, without even targeting her. to goldsmith, hegseth, who came into power on the heels of publicly characterizing the pentagon as a woke shambles after years of ignoring war fighters, has already undermined the overall power of the us military in his months-long reign. these kinds of leaks, anticipating troop movements, anticipating attacks those can put our adversaries in position to intercept pilots or convoys or ships, which could create an international incident, he said. it could mean a nuclear or a biological or a chemical crisis of some kind. within the geopolitical competition between the us, russia and china, assigning teams of capable intelligence agents trailing, hacking and spying on the every move of your top officials is an open secret. protecting those officials and the sanctity of their communications from those interventions is a well-trodden and technical mission that calls in some of americas most secretive agencies. but if the advice, devices and apps provided to those officials go ignored, foreign adversaries have an opening. hegseths adherence to operational security, opsec for short among national security professionals, referring to the general tradecraft of preventing sensitive information from being leaked, has advertised to foreign adversaries how to compromise him. well, they know what hes operating on, said joe plenzler, a retired veteran of the united states marine corps who served in the wars in iraq and afghanistan. signal is better than most other commercial apps, but its not military-grade encryption. plenzler, who was a public affairs officer in the iraq war under the former secretary of defense gen james mattis, a senior figure in trumps first administration, said he and his boss understood the importance of respecting the secrecy of communications in the field. if any officer or enlisted member had passed classified information over an unsecured or unauthorized device, we would have been immediately removed them from our position, investigated, most likely prosecuted, he said. for an officer, its a career killer. plenzler said mattis told his subordinates when youre leading marines you have to lead by example. the fastest thing that will crack the morale of any unit is the leader that says, do as i say, not as i do. plenzler added that hegseths conduct was inexcusable, especially when divulging some of the kinds of sources and methods, gleaned from intelligence-gathering, that can put peoples lives in danger. what sources are getting burned when secrets get out? people are risking their lives to help the united states, to protect our citizens and our allies, and when these things go sideways, some people are very literally running for their lives, he said. when my former boss was sitting in the chair, i felt a lot better. on monday, during the white house easter egg roll event, hegseth was chatty and defiant with the press in attendance. signal chat controversy? he said to reporters. this is what the media does they take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees, and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations. trump agreed, backing hegseth. hes doing a great job, trump said, dismissively, at the same event.

  Content: washington ap defense secretary pete hegseth created another signal messaging chat that included his wife and brother where he shared similar details of a march military airstrike against yemens houthi militants that were sent in another chain with top trump administration leaders, the new york times reported. a person familiar with the contents and those who received the messages, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, confirmed the second chat to the associated press. the second chat on signal which is a commercially available app not authorized to be used to communicate sensitive or classified national defense information included 13 people, the person said. they also confirmed the chat was dubbed defense team huddle. the new york times reported that the group included hegseths wife, jennifer, who is a former fox news producer, and his brother phil hegseth, who was hired at the pentagon as a department of homeland security liaison and senior adviser. both have traveled with the defense secretary and attended high-level meetings. the white house late sunday dismissed the report as a non-story, suggesting that disgruntled former pentagon employees were spreading false claims. no matter how many times the legacy media tries to resurrect the same non-story, they cant change the fact that no classified information was shared, said anna kelly, white house deputy press secretary. recently-fired leakers are continuing to misrepresent the truth to soothe their shattered egos and undermine the presidents agenda, but the administration will continue to hold them accountable. the revelation of the additional chat group brought fresh criticism against hegseth and president donald trumps wider administration after it has failed to take action so far against the top national security officials who discussed plans for the military strike in signal. the details keep coming out. we keep learning how pete hegseth put lives at risk. but trump is still too weak to fire him, senate democratic leader chuck schumer posted on x. pete hegseth must be fired. the first chat, set up by national security adviser mike waltz, included a number of cabinet members and came to light because jeffrey goldberg, editor-in-chief of the atlantic, was added to the group. the contents of that chat, which the atlantic published, shows that hegseth listed weapons systems and a timeline for the attack on iran-backed houthis in yemen last month. the national security council and a pentagon spokesperson did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment about the additional chat group. hegseth has previously contended that no classified information or war plans were shared in the chat with the journalist. the times reported sunday that the second chat had the same warplane launch times that the first chat included. multiple former and current officials have said sharing those operational details before a strike would have certainly been classified and their release could have put pilots in danger. hegseths use of signal and the sharing of such plans are under investigation by the defense departments acting inspector general. it came at the request of the leadership of the senate armed services committee republican chairman roger wicker of mississippi and ranking democratic member jack reed of rhode island. reed urged the ig late sunday to probe the reported second signal chat as well, saying that hegseth must immediately explain why he reportedly texted classified information that could endanger american servicemembers lives. i have grave concerns about secretary hegseths ability to maintain the trust and confidence of u.s. servicemembers and the commander-in-chief, he added. the new revelations come amid further turmoil at the pentagon. four officials in hegseths inner circle departed last week as the pentagon conducts a widespread investigation for information leaks. dan caldwell, a hegseth aide colin carroll, chief of staff to deputy defense secretary stephen feinberg and darin selnick, hegseths deputy chief of staff, were escorted out of the pentagon. while the three initially had been placed on leave pending the investigation, a joint statement shared by caldwell on x on saturday said the three still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of leaks to begin with. caldwell was the staff member designated as hegseths point person in the signal chat with trump cabinet members. former pentagon spokesman john ullyot also announced he was resigning last week, unrelated to the leaks. the pentagon said, however, that ullyot was asked to resign. ___ ap writer michelle l. price in washington contributed to this report. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: White House slams ‘fake news’ report that search is underway for Pete Hegseth replacement amid Pentagon chaos
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-21 18:36:14)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying the lens of Bureaucratic Politics, the article highlights how internal power struggles and competing interests within the Pentagon bureaucracy (as described by Ullyot's op-ed detailing 'disarray' and 'dysfunction') can significantly impact policy execution and stability, potentially distracting from core functions ('a major distraction for president trump'). The conflict between Hegseth and his sacked staffers, and Ullyot's defense of the latter, exemplifies how factionalism and information control ('accused unnamed pentagon officials of having slandered their character', 'denied that any of the fired officials had been found to have leaked anything') become central dynamics when formal authority is contested or perceived as weak.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article demonstrates aspects of Agenda-Setting Theory, where media outlets (NPR, New York Times, Politico) bring specific issues (Hegseth's group chats, Pentagon disarray, staff firings) to public attention, forcing political actors (White House, Trump, Hegseth, Don Bacon) to respond and shaping the public discourse around the Pentagon's leadership. The White House's 'aggressively pushing back' and labeling the NPR report 'total fake news' is a direct attempt to counter the agenda set by the media reports and control the narrative, illustrating the dynamic interplay between media reporting and political communication strategies.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents conflicting accounts regarding the source of the controversy and staff departures. Trump suggests the issues stem from Hegseth 'get[ting] rid of a lot of bad people' and 'disgruntled employees,' while Ullyot and the sacked staffers imply the problem lies with Hegseth's leadership and false accusations ('accused unnamed pentagon officials of having slandered their character', 'accused hegseth and his remaining team of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods'). This internal contradiction within the narrative raises questions about the true nature of the conflict: Is it a necessary house-cleaning effort, or is it symptomatic of deeper leadership failures and political maneuvering? What interests might be served by promoting one version of events over the other?; Intriguing_angles: The article notes that the initial report about the search for a replacement came from NPR, citing 'a single u.s. official,' which the White House vehemently denied as 'total fake news based on one anonymous source'. Simultaneously, the New York Times reported on the 'signal chat scandal' over the weekend, and Politico published Ullyot's op-ed. The focus on discrediting the *NPR* report specifically, while the *Times* and *Politico* reports detailing controversial actions and internal chaos are presented as factual basis for the controversy, is noteworthy. Why is the White House's counter-narrative so heavily focused on dismissing the *replacement search* report from a single source, rather than directly addressing the substance of the *other* reports detailing Hegseth's actions and the alleged dysfunction? Could this selective focus indicate which specific piece of information is perceived as the most politically damaging, or perhaps the most accurate?

aggressively pushing back on a report claiming that a search has begun for a suitable candidate to replace secretary of defense pete hegseth after it was revealed that hed been involved in yet another group chat to discuss sensitive defense information with people who had no need to know anything about it. press secretary karoline leavitt took to x at 132 pm on monday to denounce an npr report, citing a single u.s. official, that stated how the white house was starting the process to find a successor for the former fox news weekend host, who trump tapped to lead the massive agency shortly after winning the 2024 presidential election. she called the npr report total fake news based on one anonymous source who clearly has no idea what they are talking about and referenced trumps statements from earlier in the day when he reiterated his confidence in hegseth, despite the newly-unearthed signal chat scandal, which was reported on over the weekend by the new york times. as the president said this morning, he stands strongly behind hegseth, she added. open image in gallery pete hegseth dismissed the new reports from the white house lawn on monday morning. epa hegseths tenure at the defense department has been mired in controversy from the start, but the pentagon leadership was rocked this past weekend not just by the times report on how hegseth had shared details of an upcoming airstrike against iran-backed houthi rebels in yemen with his wife, brother and personal lawyer, but also by a first-person op-ed by his former top spokesperson describing chaos at the headquarters of the u.s. defense establishment. john ullyot, a veteran of the first trump administration who worked in the pentagon public affairs shop for the opening months of the new administration but recently left government service, wrote in politico magazine that the department was in disarray under hegseths leadership and described dysfunction that he called a major distraction for president trump. ullyots bombshell op-ed came just days after hegseth sacked three of his top staffers senior adviser dan caldwell, deputy chief of staff darin selnick and colin carroll, chief of staff to the deputy defense secretary purportedly for leaking information to the press. in a statement, the trio of former officials said they were are incredibly disappointed by the manner in which our service at the department of defense ended and accused unnamed pentagon officials of having slandered their character with baseless attacks on their way out the door. ullyot, the former pentagon spokesperson, denied that any of the fired officials had been found to have leaked anything and accused hegseth and his remaining team of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door. open image in gallery press secretary karoline leavitt dismissed a report suggesting the white house was seeking a new secretary of defense as total fake news. epa for now, trump appears fully supportive of the former television personality, telling reporters at the white house on monday that he thinks hegseth is doing a great job. its just fake news. they just bring up stories. i guess it sounds like disgruntled employees. he was put there to get rid of a lot of bad people and thats what hes doing so you dont always have friends when you do that, trump said. yet not all republicans are singing from the presidents hymnal on the fate of the controversial defense boss. don bacon, a former u.s. air force general and a key gop member of the house armed services committee, told politico on monday that hegseths antics would not fly if he were running things at the pentagon. im not going to tell the white house how to manage this but i find it unacceptable, and i wouldnt tolerate it if i was in charge, he said, citing what he described as a meltdown at the defense department. theres a lot a lot of smoke come out of the pentagon, and i got to believe theres some fire there somewhere, he said.

  Title: Info Pete shared with wife, brother came from top general's secure messages...
  Source: www.nbcnews.com (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Principal-Agent Theory, the article highlights General Kurilla (the agent) following protocol by sending information securely to Secretary Hegseth (the principal). The text states Kurilla 'was doing exactly what he was supposed to providing hegseth, his superior, with information he needed to know and using a system specifically designed to safely transmit sensitive and classified information.' Hegseth's alleged subsequent actions ('used his personal phone to send some of the same information... to at least two group text chats') represent a potential deviation by the principal from expected secure behavior, suggesting a possible breakdown in the principal's adherence to the very protocols agents are expected to follow.; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant as the article itself, citing NBC News and New York Times reporting, brings Hegseth's information sharing to public prominence. The text notes the sequence 'has not been previously reported' and was 'first reported sunday afternoon' by the NYT, demonstrating the media's role in selecting and highlighting this issue. Hegseth's defensive comment, 'This is what the media does,' also acknowledges the media's power to shape the public agenda around his actions.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Hegseth was allegedly warned by an aide beforehand about using unsecure systems. The text states, 'hegseth shared the information on signal even though... an aide warned him in the days beforehand to be careful not to share sensitive information on an unsecure communications system'. This detail suggests the alleged security lapse may not have been an accidental oversight but occurred despite explicit internal advice. Why might this warning have been disregarded? Does this imply a deliberate choice or a failure to heed counsel within his office?; Intriguing_angles: There is a notable tension between the description of the shared information's sensitivity and the official denial of its classification. The text describes the information as 'detailed information about the operation' including timing details that 'could... put the pilots... in grave danger,' yet Sean Parnell states, 'No classified material was ever shared via signal,' and Hegseth calls it 'informal, unclassified coordinations'. How is 'classified' being defined here, and does that definition fully capture the potential risks described? Could the focus on 'unclassified' status serve to minimize the perceived severity of sharing sensitive operational details?

  Content: washington minutes before u.s. fighter jets took off to begin strikes against iranian-backed houthi rebels in yemen last month, army gen. michael erik kurilla, who leads u.s. central command, used a secure u.s. government system to send detailed information about the operation to defense secretary pete hegseth. the material kurilla sent included details about when u.s. fighters would take off and when they would hit their targets details that could, if they fell into the wrong hands, put the pilots of those fighters in grave danger. but he was doing exactly what he was supposed to providing hegseth, his superior, with information he needed to know and using a system specifically designed to safely transmit sensitive and classified information. but then hegseth used his personal phone to send some of the same information kurilla had given him to at least two group text chats on the signal messaging app, three u.s. officials with direct knowledge of the exchanges told nbc news. the sequence of events, which has not been previously reported, could raise new questions about hegseths handling of the information, which he and the government have denied was classified. in all, according to the two sources, less than 10 minutes elapsed between kurillas giving hegseth the information and hegseths sending it to the two group chats, one of which included other cabinet-level officials and their designees and, inadvertently, the editor of the atlantic magazine. the other group included hegseths wife, his brother, his attorney and some of his aides. hegseth shared the information on signal even though, nbc news has reported, an aide warned him in the days beforehand to be careful not to share sensitive information on an unsecure communications system before the yemen strikes, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. no classified material was ever shared via signal, said the pentagons chief spokesman, sean parnell, who called the allegations an attempt to sabotage president trump and secretary hegseth. appearing tuesday morning on fox friends, the fox news show whose weekend edition hegseth previously hosted, hegseth said, what was shared over signal, then and now, however you characterize it, was informal, unclassified coordinations for media coordination, other things. thats what ive said from the beginning. president donald trump tapped hegseth, a former fox news personality, for a job for which democrats and even some republicans worried he was not qualified. now, in the wake of the revelation of the second signal chat that included his wife and his brother, which the new york times first reported sunday afternoon, he faces calls for his dismissal even as trump stands behind him. petes doing a great job everybodys happy with him, trump said monday at the white house easter egg roll. theres no dysfunction. hegseth was also defiant at the event, dismissing the reports, though not specifically denying them. this is what the media does, he said, adding, its not going to work with me, because were changing the defense department, putting the pentagon back in the hands of war fighters, and anonymous smears from disgruntled former employees on old news doesnt matter. at least one member of trumps own party sees it differently. rep. don bacon, of nebraska, who is on the house armed services committee, on monday became the first sitting republican member of congress to publicly call on hegseth to resign. i had concerns from the get-go because pete hegseth didnt have a lot of experience, said bacon, a retired air force general. i like him on fox, but does he have the experience to lead one of the largest organizations in the world? thats a concern. two trump advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity monday, dismissed the idea that hegseth will be fired. there is no talk right now of removing or replacing him. we have been through this before, and as of the moment, its just not something we are talking about, one said. the other said the idea something like this would force him out is not reality. the president still supports him. a former senior official in trumps first administration, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fear of retaliation, expressed bafflement at hegseths decision to share the information about the yemen strike with his wife and his brother. i cant imagine a scenario where national security officials would see fit to share sensitive details about policy and planning with family members who dont have a need to know, the former official said. to do it over an unclassified messaging app is even more egregious.

  Title: GOP Rep. Don Bacon fries Pete Hegseth over Signal chats: ‘Acting like he’s above the law’
  Source: nypost.com (2025-04-21 16:11:55)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Principal-Agent Theory, the article illustrates the challenges faced by a 'principal' (the President/Administration) in overseeing the actions of an 'agent' (the Defense Secretary). The text highlights this through the agent's alleged unauthorized information sharing ('hegseth sent details... to a signal chat group') and the principal's public defense ('the white house has publicly stood by hegseth, with president trump telling reporters... Hes doing a great job'), despite concerns raised by other actors ('rep. don bacon became the first sitting house republican monday to suggest president trump should fire defense secretary'). This dynamic suggests potential information asymmetry and differing priorities between the principal and agent, impacting accountability and control within the executive branch.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article strongly reflects elements of Agenda-Setting Theory, where media outlets (New York Times, National Public Radio) play a significant role in determining which issues are considered important and become subjects of public and political debate. The narrative is structured around media reports ('late sunday, the new york times reported...', 'a report by national public radio monday') which trigger political reactions ('bacon said monday', 'the white house also denied a report'). Hegseth's counter-narrative ('a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out from the same media') explicitly acknowledges the media's power to frame the issue, suggesting the focus on his communication method is a result of deliberate media action, thereby shaping the public agenda around personnel conduct rather than potentially other defense-related matters.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents conflicting accounts regarding the sensitivity of the information shared. The Pentagon spokesperson states 'there was no classified information in any signal chat,' while Rep. Bacon asserts that Hegseth was 'putting secret stuff on his phone.' This direct contradiction within the text itself is noteworthy. Why is there such a stark difference in how the information's classification is described by different sources quoted in the article? Does the article provide sufficient context for the reader to evaluate these competing claims about the nature of the shared information?

  Content: rep. don bacon became the first sitting house republican monday to suggest president trump should fire defense secretary pete hegseth following another controversy over unauthorized disclosure of war plans. i had concerns from the get-go because pete hegseth didnt have a lot of experience, bacon r-neb., a former air force brigadier general who has criticized trump over his handling of the war in ukraine, told politico. i like him on fox. but does he have the experience to lead one of the largest organizations in the world? thats a concern. late sunday, the new york times reported that hegseth sent details of a march 15 strike against iran-backed houthis in yemen to a signal chat group that included his wife, brother and personal attorney. the report followed controversy last month over the inclusion of atlantic magazine editor-in-chief jeffrey goldberg on a signal thread detailing the plan of attack. that chat group included vice president jd vance, national security adviser mike waltz and white house deputy chief of staff and homeland security policy adviser stephen miller. 3 pete hegseth alleged that disgruntled fired staffers leaked dirt about him to the press. getty images if its true that he had another signal chat with his family, about the missions against the houthis, its totally unacceptable, bacon said monday. im not in the white house, and im not going to tell the white house how to manage this, he went on, but i find it unacceptable, and i wouldnt tolerate it if i was in charge. pentagon spokesperson sean parnell was emphatic in a statement responding to the times report that there was no classified information in any signal chat, but bacon was not swayed. russia and china put up thousands of people to monitor all these phone calls at the very top, and the no. 1 target besides the president would be the secretary of defense, he said. russia and china are all over his phone, and for him to be putting secret stuff on his phone is not right. hes acting like hes above the law and that shows an amateur person. 3 pete hegseth had shared strike plans against the houthis in a private signal chat that leaked last month. when asked for a comment about bacons remarks, a pentagon spokesperson told the post, we do not comment on remarks from political leaders. the white house has publicly stood by hegseth, with president trump telling reporters monday questions about his job status were a waste of time. hes doing a great job, the president said at the white house easter egg roll. ask the houthis how hes doing. 3 don bacon described the purge at the pentagon as a meltdown and questioned pete hegseths management. getty images what a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out from the same media that peddled the russia hoax, hegseth told reporters at the same event. this is what the media does. they take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations. the white house also denied a report by national public radio monday that it has begun the search for a new defense secretary. bacon represents nebraskas 2nd congressional district, which vice president kamala harris won in 2024. the republican narrowly held the battleground district by about 1.8 percentage points this past november.

  Title: State Department wants staff to report instances of alleged anti-Christian bias during Biden's term
  Source: abcnews.go.com (2025-04-13 21:02:10)
  Content: as the christian world commemorates holy week leading up to easter sunday, the state department has issued an appeal for its employees to report instances of alleged anti-christian bias, including actions taken for opposition to vaccines or personal pr. washington - as the christian world commemorates holy week leading up to easter sunday, the state department has issued an appeal for its employees to report instances of alleged anti-christian bias, including formal or informal actions due to opposition to vaccines or personal pronoun choice, that may have occurred during the biden administration. the call comes amid heightened fear and anxiety in the american diplomatic corps, which is bracing for a new update on the department of government efficiency -inspired budget and staff cuts that is due to be presented to the white house on monday. that update is expected to include the state departments latest estimates of voluntary retirements and separations and how those will affect potential future layoffs to meet benchmarks from elon musks doge and the governments human resources agency, according to officials familiar with the process. in an unexpected move, pete marocco, a trump administration political appointee who oversaw the dismantling of the u.s. agency for international development, has left the state department, the officials said. he had moved to state as the director of foreign assistance in march after the remaining usaid programs were shifted under the department. department spokeswoman tammy bruce told reporters at the time that marocco was filling an indispensable role in aligning all u.s. government foreign assistance with the presidents priorities. but in confirming maroccos departure on sunday, the officials said marocco left after completing the job he was brought on board to do, which was to dismantle usaid. the update to be presented monday also is expected to add clarity to plans to fold any surviving usaid programs into the department. but these officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters, said the update to the white house office of personnel management would not be the final word on the reorganization of the state department. and, they denied speculation among the rank and file that secretary of state marco rubio had refused to sign off on the document. while foreign and civil service employees await word on their futures, the state department has moved ahead with an initiative aimed at rooting out religious bias in its policies and hiring practices with a specific emphasis on anti-christian activity that may have occurred under president joe biden. there is no immediate indication that such discrimination, as defined by president donald trumps state department, took place under biden. in a cable sent friday to all u.s. diplomatic missions, rubio asked that staffers report any perceived discriminatory actions taken against christians or employees advocating on their behalf between january 2021 and january 2025. the cable, copies of which were obtained by the associated press, says that all reported allegations will be investigated by a government-wide task force on anti-christian bias and if discrimination is found the culprits may be disciplined. it also makes clear that allegations can be submitted anonymously. the task force will collect information and ideas from individuals and groups, including department employees, affected by anti-christian bias or other religious discriminatory conduct, the cable says. the task force is soliciting examples of anti-religious bias, particularly from the past four years, where the department targeted anyone for their religion, including discrimination, harassment, exclusion, disciplinary action, adverse security clearance determinations, or any other adverse action, or in retaliation for exercising their religious rights, the cable said. this includes anti-religious bias committed by department employees in their official duties against members of the public. examples of potential violations include formal or informal actions taken against a person because they requested religious accommodation from taking mandatory vaccines or observing religious holidays and mistreatment for refusing to participate in events and activities that promoted themes inconsistent with or hostile to ones religious beliefs, including policies or practices related to preferred personal pronouns, according to the cable. others include mistreatment for opposing displays of flags, banners or other paraphernalia on or in government facilities because of religious objection or for opposing official media content due to religious objections, forcing employees to remove personal displays of religious faith or conscience, whether as part of clothingaccessories items on desks or in personal workspace, the cable said. in non-governmental chat groups and elsewhere, some state department employees expressed alarm over the cable, particularly as it was issued shortly after the promotion of a junior foreign service officer to temporarily run the departments human resources office, the bureau of global talent management. lew olowski assumed that job last week and in his first comments to employees gave a welcome address to a new class of incoming diplomats that cited both biblical verses and religiously themed quotes from president abraham lincoln. after swearing in the new class with the oath to constitution, olowski told them oaths and words are different. words are for talking. dolphins can talk. oaths are covenants. animals do not covenant. only god and man can make covenants. to an officer of the united states like you and me, the constitution is our commandment. its words are like the word of god and the words of the oath are our creation as officers, he said, according to a transcript of his remarks. and these words are our beginning. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god, he said, before praising foreign service officers who have died while in service to the country. in a perhaps unusual coincidence, reports of anti-christian or other religious bias are to be reported to olowskis wife, heather, who is the head of the state departments office of civil rights. last week, the american foreign service association, which represents u.s. diplomats, and the american academy of diplomacy said olowskis appointment was an affront to the long-held standard that the post be occupied by either a current senior or retired career diplomat. his numerous pro-trump and anti-immigrant writings in conservative publications over the past several years had been been widely shared among internal group chats. ___ associated press writer sam mednick in jerusalem contributed to this report.

  Title: Predawn firing spree at HHS leaves agencies gutted and Congress frustrated

ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows

not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. tuesday marked the beginning of the end for the federal governments public health authorities, with a 5am wave of reduction-in-force rif emails placing thousands of employees on notice for imminent termination. whole sub-agencies at the department of health and human services hhs are gone, according to furious and despondent current and former employees who flooded reddit boards with firsthand accounts. the cuts gutted or wholly shut down regional offices, the agencys it infrastructure, the food and drug administration fda and even an agency that mobilizes after natural disasters, like hurricanes the administration for strategic preparedness and response. the website for that agency was already down by noon. im overwhelmed with messages about the firings. the fda as weve known it is finished, wrote former fda commissioner dr robert carliff on linkedin. i believe that history will see this as a huge mistake, he said. i will be glad if im proven wrong, but even then there is no good reason to treat people this way. it will be interesting to hear from the new leadership how they plan to put humpty dumpty back together again. lines appeared outside of hhs offices in washington dc as well as at regional offices around the country. six regional offices were already confirmed to be closing in march. many employees appeared to be learning of their terminations in real time as they arrived for work. on tuesday, it appeared that hundreds of employees had missed the early-morning emails announcing the terminations and were ushered in to see if their security badges still granted access. cuts appeared to hit administrative divisions at the agencies, including communications staff, particularly hard. robert f kennedy jr, the nations health secretary, hadnt issued a public statement about the reduction-in-force emails by early tuesday afternoon. the secretary was in washington, however, celebrating the swearing-in of dr. jay bhattacharya as director of the national institutes of health nih and dr. marty makary as head of the fda, per a post from the main hhs twitter account. democrats on the house oversight committee said that members had staff outside various hhs offices around the district of columbia passing out whistleblower resources to fired employees. congressional republicans, meanwhile, seemed caught on the back foot by the news once again. im trying to understand it, senator bill cassidy, chair of the senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions, told cnn. they say that they are consolidating duplicative agencies, the senator added. he didnt take a position on supporting the cuts, which number around 10,000 hhs employees in total. cory booker, a democratic senator from new jersey, was still speaking as part of a marathon address on the senate floor he began monday evening denouncing republican threats to cut medicaid and the effects of doges campaign to reduce the size of the federal government. with a few assists from other democrats, the senator held the floor through noon on tuesday, more than 18 hours one of the longest in senate history. bookers faux filibuster, which didnt block any legislation, followed a decision by a number of the senators democratic colleagues to break a democratic filibuster on a funding bill in march. senator bernie sanders and cassidy, the top democrat and republican on the senate committee overseeing hhs, sent a letter on tuesday to kennedy urging his testimony on the reduction in force at an upcoming hearing. he isnt required to attend, and congress has no direct authority to force him to reverse any cuts. with many employees themselves unsure of the scope of cuts to the nations public health authority and some likely to challenge their terminations in court, its not yet set in stone what the final toll of tuesdays action will be. but its clear that elon musks doge effort is continuing to move at a breakneck pace across the federal government, undeterred by ongoing attempts to mitigate its work. experts warn that rebuilding will take much more time. at some point in the future, a democratic president and secretary of hhs will probably try to rebuild the department following the major staffing cuts happening now. it wont be easy, and will likely require congress, wrote larry levitt, executive vice president for health policy at kff formerly the kaiser family foundation. the general public likely wont feel the results of these hhs layoffs immediately, levitt added. but eventually, these layoffs will affect the health information available to people, access to care and prevention, and oversight of health and social services. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: HEGSETH ISOLATED AND DEFIANT...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Principal-Agent theory illuminates the dynamic between President Trump (the principal) and Secretary Hegseth (the agent). The text highlights Trump's public support ("declaring the embattled defense secretary is doing a great job") juxtaposed with the precariousness of this support ("the president always expresses support for his team right until he doesnt"). This suggests the principal's evaluation of the agent is based on perceived loyalty and public performance rather than solely on bureaucratic effectiveness or adherence to standard procedure (like handling classified information), creating uncertainty for the agent and those around him.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article exemplifies aspects of Bureaucratic Politics theory, where different factions within the Pentagon and administration compete for influence and control. The text describes "seismic dysfunction within the pentagon amid political infighting," "pentagon officials have watched the unraveling... with alarm," and claims like "the entire pentagon is working to undermine him." This suggests policy outcomes and personnel decisions are not purely rational choices but results of power struggles and competing interests among various bureaucratic actors.; Intriguing_angles: The text repeatedly mentions "anonymous sources" as the basis for reports critical of Hegseth, while Hegseth and his allies frame these sources as "disgruntled former employees colluding with journalists" and claim the "leaks investigation was weaponized." This highlights a core conflict over the legitimacy and motivation of information dissemination, suggesting a battle for control over the public narrative. What are the specific interests potentially served by portraying the leaks as either legitimate concerns or politically motivated attacks?; Intriguing_angles: The discussion of Ricky Buria's potential appointment notes his prior service under Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in the Biden administration and states "it is unclear whether the white house will accept buria." This detail, seemingly minor, raises questions about the criteria for key appointments beyond professional qualifications, hinting at political vetting processes and potential ideological or loyalty-based barriers to advancement even for career military personnel. What does the uncertainty surrounding Buria's acceptance reveal about the administration's approach to staffing the Defense Department?

  Content: president donald trump on monday dismissed a deepening controversy surrounding pete hegseth, declaring the embattled defense secretary is doing a great job despite seismic dysfunction within the pentagon amid political infighting, numerous firings, and reports he divulged to his wife, brother and lawyer the highly sensitive details of an imminent military operation. the turmoil elicited a rebuke from at least one republican lawmaker, who labeled the situation a meltdown, and called into question how long trumps affection for the increasingly isolated and defiant cabinet pick will last. pentagon officials have watched the unraveling of hegseths inner circle with alarm, concerned how it would function in a national security emergency and wondering whether the president may be forced to act. the president always expresses support for his team right until he doesnt and you read about it in the tweet the next day, said one person familiar with trumps thinking, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the crisis. speaking outside the white house, hegseth, a former fox news personality and national guard veteran, defended himself angrily. he lambasted the news media for publishing a bunch of hit pieces that were seeded, he suggested, by the officials whom he had fired for leaking to reporters. the anonymous sources in those stories, hegseth assessed without providing evidence, are disgruntled former employees colluding with journalists to slash and burn people, and ruin their reputations. its not going to work with me, hegseth vowed on the sidelines of the annual white house easter egg roll, saying the newly surfaced accusations about his advance disclosure of attack plans doesnt matter. he added that he and trump had spoken and that they are on the same page all the way. the uproar follows a report sunday by the new york times indicating hegseth on march 15 had shared the timing and other key aspects of a bombing campaign in yemen with a small group of people that included his wife, jennifer, brother, phil, and personal lawyer, tim parlatore, using the encrypted but unclassified messaging application signal. that coincided with a related controversy in which trumps national security adviser, michael waltz, unwittingly included the atlantic magazines top editor in a separate signal group used by numerous senior administration officials to coordinate the yemen strikes. hegseth disclosed highly sensitive details there, too information that former defense officials have assessed typically would be highly classified and restricted to only a small number of people. the upheaval in the pentagon dates back at least a month, to another unflattering report that the billionaire elon musk was due to receive a briefing that would include closely guarded secrets revealing how the u.s. military would probably conduct a war with china. trump himself was troubled by the idea and intervened, officials familiar with the matter said, though the administration reacted publicly by questioning the accuracy of the reporting and launching an investigation into leaks officials suspected of arising from the defense department. the incident marked an inflection point, with hegseth and senior aides becoming increasingly paranoid, two officials familiar with the matter said. about a week later, the atlantic published its first account of the signal debacle, exacerbating the acrimony and distrust that has taken hold at the highest levels of the pentagon. the discord spilled into public view last week with the ouster of three senior defense officials dan caldwell, colin carroll, and darin selnick for allegedly making unauthorized disclosures to the news media. in a joint statement saturday, the three fired political appointees accused hegseths team of slander and said they have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of leaks to begin with. the firings of caldwell and selnick, longtime associates of hegseth whom he had asked to join his team, were especially disquieting, several people who know them said. caldwell said in an interview with conservative journalist tucker carlson that aired monday evening that he had not leaked information to the media and has not been provided with a reason for his firing. despite the allegations against him, he said he has not received a polygraph test or been asked to provide his phone to authorities to be examined for potential leaks. caldwell added that he believes the leaks investigation was weaponized against him, selnick and carroll. he said that when he was first escorted out of his office, he thought he was about to be asked to testify against hegseth in an ongoing inspector general investigation about his use of signal. he had access to highly classified information until right before he was removed, he added. if i actually did some of the things that anonymous people on the internet and people in the pentagon said i did, id be in handcuffs, caldwell said. hegseths team also intends to remove his chief of staff, joe kasper, and shift him to a less visible but as yet undefined defense department role, people familiar with the matter said. that development, first reported by politico, followed weeks of friction between kasper and other colleagues, these people said. defense officials have declined to acknowledge kaspers impending move or address questions about who is fulfilling the duties of the defense secretarys chief of staff. sean parnell, a spokesman for hegseth, did not respond to requests for comment. a former hegseth spokesman, john ullyot, also has turned on the defense secretary, saying in an opinion piece published by politico that he had doubts about his ability to do his job. ullyot, who was removed from his position last month after colleagues questioned his judgment, wrote that it has been a month of total chaos at the pentagon and that trump deserved better from his senior leaders. karoline leavitt, a spokeswoman for trump, portrayed hegseth as the victim of expansive opposition from within the department, alleging that the entire pentagon is working to undermine him. to reinforce his inner circle of political aides, hegseth plans to make marine corps col. ricky buria, most recently his junior military assistant, a senior adviser and possibly even chief of staff or deputy chief of staff, two people familiar with the matter said. defense officials said buria unexpectedly submitted paperwork last week to leave the marine corps and is now considered on terminal leave, transitioning out of the service. buria was promoted to his current rank last fall, meaning that, without a waiver, he will revert back to his previous rank lieutenant colonel in retirement. with few exceptions, a service member must hold a rank satisfactorily for two years to retire at that pay grade and receive benefits commensurate with it. the person familiar with trumps thinking questioned whether buria is suited for such a job, noting that he first served as a junior military aide to defense secretary lloyd austin in the biden administration. while it is common for military officers to hold nonpartisan roles that bridge presidential administrations, it is unclear whether the white house will accept buria. on monday, rep. don bacon r-nebraska, a retired air force general, said that the military should always pride itself on maintaining operational security and that it is unacceptable if the new reports about hegseths handling of sensitive information are true. if a democrat did this, wed be demanding a scalp, bacon said. i dont like hypocrisy. we should be americans first when it comes to security. missy ryan and abigail hauslohner contributed to this report.

  Title: I worked in Trump’s first administration. Here’s why his team is using Signal | Kevin Carroll
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-04 14:00:55)
  Content: no senior us government official in the now-infamous houthi pc small group signal chat seemed new to that kind of group, nor surprised by the sensitivity of the subject discussed in that insecure forum, not even when the defense secretary, pete hegseth, chimed in with details of a coming airstrike. no one objected not the director of national intelligence, tulsi gabbard, who was abroad and using her personal cellphone to discuss pending military operations not even the presidential envoy steve witkoff, who was in moscow at the time. yet most of these officials enjoy the luxury of access to secure government communications systems 247365. reasonable conclusions may be drawn from these facts. first, trumps national security cabinet commonly discusses secret information on insecure personal devices. second, sophisticated adversaries such as russia and china intercept such communications, especially those sent or received in their countries. third, as a result, hostile intelligence services now probably possess blackmail material regarding these officials indiscreet past conversations on similar topics. fourth, as a first-term trump administration official and ex-cia officer, i believe the reason these officials risk interacting in this way is to prevent their communications from being preserved as required by the presidential records act, and avoid them being discoverable in litigation, or subject to a subpoena or freedom of information act request. and fifth, no one seems to have feared being investigated by the justice department for what appears to be a violation of the espionage acts section 793f, which makes gross negligence in mishandling classified information a felony the fbi director, kash patel, and attorney general, pam bondi, quickly confirmed that hunch. remarkably, the cia director john ratcliffe wouldnt even admit to congress that he and his colleagues had made a mistake. the knock-on effects of this are many. the secretary of state, marco rubio, needs to address his colleagues characterization of european partners as pathetic with foreign ministers now dubious of the uss intentions. allies already hesitant to share their countries secrets with the us, because of valid counterintelligence concerns regarding trumps affinity for vladimir putin, will clam up even more rather than risk their sources being compromised by trumps appointees. gabbard and ratcliffe may have perjured themselves before congress regarding whether their signal chat included classified national defense information certainly, their credibility on capitol hill is shredded. as a former cia case officer, i suspect these directors own subordinates will prefer not to share restricted handling information with them going forward. hegseth, confirmed as secretary by a vote of 51-50 despite concerns over his character and sobriety, lost any moral authority to lead the defense department by reflexively lying about his misconduct, claiming that the story by jeffrey goldberg, the unsuspecting atlantic editor improvidently included in the text chain, is somehow a hoax despite the fact the white house contemporaneously confirmed its authenticity. trump dismisses this scandal, now under investigation by the pentagons inspector general, as a witch-hunt, and his followers will fall in line. but every senator who voted to confirm these national security officials, despite doubts regarding their temperaments and qualifications, quietly knows that they own part of this debacle. for fear of facing republican primary challengers funded by elon musk, these senators failed in their solemn constitutional duty to independently provide wise advice and consent regarding nominations to the uss most important war cabinet posts. how would the senators have explained their misfeasance to service members bereaved families their constituents, perhaps had the houthis used information from the signal chat, such as the time a particular target was to be engaged, to reorient their antiaircraft systems to intercept the inbound aircraft? i happen to have served in yemen as a sensitive activities officer for special operations command central. conspicuous in their absence from the signal chat were uniformed officers responsible for the recent combat mission the acting chair of the joint chiefs of staff adm christopher grady, central commands gen michael kurilla and special operations commands gen bryan fenton. these good men would have raised the obvious objection loose talk on insecure phones about a coming operation jeopardizes the lives of us sailors and marines standing watch on warships in the red sea and gulf of aden, naval aviators flying over the beach towards the target, and likely special operators, intelligence officers and human sources working in the shadows on the ground. you dont need 30-plus years in uniform to know that holding a detailed yet insecure discussion about a pending military mission is wrong the participants in the chat knew, too. they just didnt care, not as much as they cared about keeping their communications from being legally discoverable. theyre safe in the knowledge that in a new era without benefit of the rule of law, patels fbi and bondis justice department will never bring charges against them, for a crime which uniformed service members are routinely prosecuted for vastly smaller infractions. as the attorney general made plain in her remarks about this matter, federal law enforcement is now entirely subservient to trumps personal and political interests. most senior us government officials in 2025 are, unfortunately, far gone from the fine old gentlemans tradition of honorable resignation. but participants in the signal chat should consider the hollywood producer character jack woltzs pained observation to the mafia lawyer tom hagen in the godfather about his indiscreetly wayward mistress a man in my position cannot afford to be made to look ridiculous. trump, the justice department and the republican congress may not make them resign, but to the uss allies and adversaries, and to their own subordinates, these officials now look ridiculous.

  Title: ‘Full-blown meltdown’ at Pentagon after Hegseth’s second Signal chat revealed
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-21 15:28:27)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory. The New York Times' report, followed by amplification in outlets like 'The Guardian,' directly brought the 'second signal chat' and Ullyot's critique to public attention. As the text states, 'the new york times reported that hegseth shared details...in a second signal chat' and 'the guardian has independently confirmed the existence'. This initial reporting, focusing on Hegseth's actions and Pentagon 'chaos,' frames the subsequent public discourse and political reactions, pushing the issue onto the agenda for debate and potential action.; Theories_and_interpretations: Bureaucratic Politics. The article highlights a power struggle within the Pentagon, evidenced by 'mass firings' and 'disgruntled former employees' cited by both Hegseth and the media. Ullyot's 'opinion essay' in 'Politico' explicitly describes 'staff drama and turnover' and a 'full-blown meltdown'. This suggests that policy decisions and information flow are being shaped by internal bureaucratic conflicts and personal agendas, rather than purely rational or strategic considerations, impacting the department's effectiveness and potentially national security.; Intriguing_angles: Contradictory narratives. President Trump's public defense of Hegseth at the 'easter egg roll' ('Petes doing a great job') directly clashes with Ullyot's portrayal of 'total chaos' and a 'full-blown meltdown' at the Pentagon. This stark contrast, both presented within the same article, raises questions about whose account is more accurate and what motivations might underlie these divergent perspectives. Is Trump downplaying the severity for political reasons, or is Ullyot exaggerating his claims due to personal grievances?; Intriguing_angles: Omission of specifics. While the article repeatedly mentions 'sensitive military operations' and 'classified information,' it provides no concrete details about *what* information was actually shared in the Signal chats.  Phrases like 'details of a us attack on yemeni houthi rebels' and 'flight schedules for the fa-18 hornets' remain vague. This lack of specificity, despite the gravity of the accusations, prompts questions about the actual nature and sensitivity of the leaked information. Could the ambiguity be intentional, serving to amplify the perception of wrongdoing without risking further disclosures?

  Content: pressure was mounting on the us defense secretary, pete hegseth, on monday following reports of a second signal chatroom used to discuss sensitive military operations, while a former top pentagon spokesperson slammed the uss top military officials leadership of the department of defense. john ullyot, who resigned last week after initially serving as pentagon spokesperson, said in a opinion essay published by politico on sunday that the pentagon has been overwhelmed by staff drama and turnover in the initial months of the second trump administration. ullyot called the situation a full-blown meltdown that could cost hegseth, a 44-year-old former fox news host and national guard officer, his job as defense secretary. its been a month of total chaos at the pentagon. from leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings, the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president who deserves better from his senior leadership, ullyot wrote. donald trump jr pushed back on the opinion piece, saying the author is officially exiled from trumps political movement. this guy is not america first, trump jr wrote on x. ive been hearing for years that he works his ass off to subvert my fathers agenda. that ends today. the warning came as the new york times reported that hegseth shared details of a us attack on yemeni houthi rebels last month in a second signal chat that he created himself and included his wife, his brother and about a dozen other people. the guardian has independently confirmed the existence of hegseths own private group chat. according to unnamed sources familiar with the chat who spoke to the times, hegseth sent the private group of his personal associates some of the same information, including the flight schedules for the fa-18 hornets that would strike houthi rebel targets in yemen, that he also shared with another signal group of top officials that was created by mike waltz, the national security adviser. the existence of the signal group chat created by waltz, in which detailed attack plans were divulged by hegseth to other trump administration officials on the private messaging app, were made public by the atlantic magazines jeffrey goldberg, who had been accidentally added to the group. the existence of a second signal chat, coupled with ullyots devastating portrait of the pentagon under hegseth, is likely to increase pressure on the white house to take action. trump defended hegseth at the annual easter egg roll at the white house. petes doing a great job, the president said. just ask the houthis how hes doing. its just fake news. they just bring up stories. it sounds like disgruntled employees. he was put there to get rid of a lot of bad people and thats what hes doing. you dont always have friends when you do that. hegseth himself blamed disgruntled former employees in remarks to reporters at the same event. what a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out from the same media that peddled the russia hoax, hegseth said. this is what the media does. they take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees, and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations. he continued not going to work with me, because were changing the defense department, putting the pentagon back in the hands of war-fighters. and anonymous smears from disgruntled former employees on old news doesnt matter. the pentagons chief spokesperson, sean parnell, issued a statement in a post on x on sunday night following the new york times report. another day, another old story back from the dead, parnell said. the trump-hating media continues to be obsessed with destroying anyone committed to president trumps agenda. this time, the new york times and all other fake news that repeat their garbage are enthusiastically taking the grievances of disgruntled former employees as the sole sources for their article. there was no classified information in any signal chat, no matter how many ways they try to write the story. what is true is that the office of the secretary of defense is continuing to become stronger and more efficient in executing president trumps agenda. weve already achieved so much for the american warfighter, and will never back down. tammy duckworth, a democratic senator from illinois and combat veteran, said in a statement that the second signal chat put the lives of us men and women in uniform at greater risk how many times does pete hegseth need to leak classified intelligence before donald trump and republicans understand that he isnt only a fcking liar, he is a threat to our national security? every day he stays in his job is another day our troops lives are endangered by his singular stupidity, duckworth said. he must resign in disgrace. jack reed, a democratic senator from rhode island and a senior member of the senate armed services committee, said the report, if true, is another troubling example of secretary hegseths reckless disregard for the laws and protocols that every other military service member is required to follow. reed called on hegseth to immediately explain why he reportedly texted classified information that could endanger american service members lives on a commercial app that included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. reed said he had warned that mr hegseth lacks the experience, competence, and character to run the department of defense. in light of the ongoing chaos, dysfunction, and mass firings under mr hegseths leadership, it seems that those objections were well-founded. ullyot warned that under hegseth the pentagon focus is no longer on warfighting, but on endless drama and said the president deserves better than the current mishegoss at the pentagon.

  Title: Abcarian: Pete Hegseth says he knew what he was doing. In that case, he should resign
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-03-30 10:08:01)
  Content: well, america, who you gonna believe? the trump administration officials who royally screwed up with their signal group chat about combat plans, or your lyin eyes? there was no classified information as i understand it, said president trump on tuesday, a day after the atlantics jeffrey goldberg reported that hed been accidentally added to a group chat on the messaging app signal in which the countrys top national security officials were blabbing about imminent plans to drop bombs on houthi rebels in yemen. i can attest to the fact that there were not classified or intelligence equities that were included in that chat group at any time, the dictator-curious director of national intelligence tulsi gabbard testified in a senate intelligence committee meeting hearing. nobodys texting war plans, insisted defense secretary pete hegseth to reporters in hawaii on wednesday. and yet, as goldberg reported, hegseth described airstrikes that would be carried out by navy f-18s based on an aircraft carrier in the red sea, and drone attacks launched from the middle east. giving an exact time, he wrote, this is when the first bombs will definitely drop. sounds like classified or intelligence equities to me. among the lineup for the rest of chat group vice president jd vance, secretary of state marco rubio and national security advisor mike waltz, who has taken responsibility for somehow including goldberg. the trump administration, with its irrational destruction of critical services and institutions, with its incompetence and willful ignorance, is playing jenga with our lives and american democracy. remove a few more pieces of what holds this country together the social safety net, the ability of our courts to protect us from tyrannical overreach, the facts about current events and u.s. history and its all going to come crashing down. maybe it already has. i know exactly what im doing, said hegseth, the fox news weekend host elevated by the president to one of the most important jobs in the world because, its been suggested, he looks good on tv. in the short time the former national guard infantryman has been the face of the mighty united states military, he has consistently shown he does not, in fact, know what he is doing. during his first appearance on the world stage in brussels, hegseth foolishly ruled out nato membership for ukraine and suggested its borders could never be restored to what they were before russia annexed crimea in 2014. what a negotiator! he threw away ukraines leverage before peace talks had even begun. he made a rookie mistake, said republican mississippi sen. roger wicker, who compared hegseths comments to something that could have been written by tucker carlson and carlson is a fool. in any case, since when does the person in charge of the american military its 2.8 million people, its 750 bases in 80 countries, its 850-billion budget get to enjoy a learning curve? mr. hegseths lastest mistake could have led to catastrophic consequences, said the new york times in a news story about the defense secretarys constant missteps. in disclosing the aircraft, targets and timing for hitting houthi militia sites in yemen, mr. hegseth risked the lives of american war fighters. arguing, as trump and his allies have, that the information was not classified therefore no laws were broken is simply specious. it was sensitive information, not classified, and inadvertently released, atty. gen. pam bondi told reporters thursday, appearing to rule out any sort of criminal investigation. and yet, the espionage act makes it a crime to handle national security secrets with such gross negligence that they fall into the hands of an unauthorized person, as the signal chat did. it was also set to disappear after a set period of time, a violation of the federal law that requires all official communications to be archived. its by the awesome grace of god that we are not mourning dead pilots right now, said connecticut rep. jim himes, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee during a hearing wednesday. everyone here knows that the russians or the chinese could have gotten all of that information, and they could have passed it on to the houthis, who easily could have repositioned weapons and altered their plans to knock down planes or sink ships. if the government officials in charge of keeping us safe dont think details of an upcoming bombing mission should be held as tightly as possible and not splashed around an app that is vulnerable to enemy hackers, they have no business keeping their jobs. if this arrogant group had an ounce of integrity or humility, someone and it ought to be hegseth would resign. at the very least, he should apologize for this colossal screw up and plead for forgiveness from the americans he put in harms way. bluesky rabcarian.bsky.social threads rabcarian

  Title: Pentagon watchdog to review Hegseth’s use of Signal app to convey plans for Houthi strike
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-03 23:50:30)
  Content: u.s. secretary of defense pete hegseth attends a joint news conference with japans defense minister gen nakatani at the ministry of defense in tokyo sunday, march 30, 2025. kiyoshi otapool photo via ap follow live updates on president donald trump and his administration washington ap the pentagons acting inspector general announced thursday that he would review defense secretary pete hegseths use of the signal messaging app to convey plans for a military strike against houthi militants in yemen. the review will also look at other defense officials use of the publicly available encrypted app, which is not able to handle classified material and is not part of the defense departments secure communications network. hegseths use of the app came to light when a journalist, jeffrey goldberg of the atlantic, was inadvertently added to a signal text chain by national security adviser mike waltz. the chain included hegseth, vice president jd vance, secretary of state marco rubio, director of national intelligence tulsi gabbard and others, brought together to discuss march 15 military operations against the iran-backed houthis. the objective of this evaluation is to determine the extent to which the secretary of defense and other dod personnel complied with dod policies and procedures for the use of a commercial messaging application for official business, the acting inspector general, steven stebbins, said in a notification letter to hegseth. the letter also said his office will review compliance with classification and records retention requirements. hegseth and other members of the trump administration are required by law to archive their official conversations, and it is not clear if copies of the discussions were forwarded to an official email so they could be permanently captured for federal records keeping. the pentagon referred all questions to the inspector generals office, citing the ongoing investigation. president donald trump grew frustrated when asked about the review. youre bringing that up again, trump scoffed at a reporter. dont bring that up again. your editors probably thats such a wasted story. in the chain, hegseth provided the exact timings of warplane launches and when bombs would drop before the men and women carrying out those attacks on behalf of the united states were airborne. the review was launched at the request of sen. roger wicker, r-miss. , chairman of the senate armed services committee, and rhode island sen. jack reed, the committees top democrat. in congressional hearings, democratic lawmakers have expressed concern about the use of signal and pressed military officers on whether they would find it appropriate to use the commercial app to discuss military operations. both current and former military officials have said the level of detail hegseth shared on signal most likely would have been classified. the trump administration has insisted no classified information was shared. waltz is fighting back against calls for his ouster and, so far, trump has said he stands by his national security adviser. on thursday, trump fired several members of waltzs staff after far-right activist laura loomer urged the president to purge staffers she deemed insufficiently loyal to his make america great again agenda, several people familiar with the matter said. in his senate confirmation hearing tuesday, trumps nominee for chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, lt. gen. dan caine, would not say whether the officials should have used a more secure communications system to discuss the attack plans. what i will say is we should always preserve the element of surprise, caine told senators.

  Title: Laura Loomer’s Role in NSC Firings Shows Rising Sway of Fringe Figures on Trump
  Source: www.nytimes.com (2025-04-04 22:03:40)
  Content: laura loomer had president trumps full attention. sitting directly across from the president in the oval office, ms. loomer, the far-right agitator and conspiracy theorist, held a stack of papers that detailed a litany of accusations about disloyal members of the national security council. the national security adviser, michael waltz, had arrived late and could only watch as ms. loomer ripped into his staff. fire them, mr. trump instructed mr. waltz, according to people with knowledge of the meeting on wednesday. the president was furious and demanded to know why these people had been hired in the first place. the events of wednesday and thursday, with more than a half-dozen national security officials fired on the advice of ms. loomer, unsettled even some veteran trump officials. but the situation perfectly encapsulates mr. trumps longtime penchant for soliciting information from dubious sources. the difference now, in mr. trumps second term, is that he has fewer people around him who try to keep those voices away. in a social media post on friday, ms. loomer explained why two of the people who lost their jobs this week were on her list. gen. timothy d. haugh, the head of the national security agency and u.s. cyber command, had been chosen by gen. mark milley, the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, whom ms. loomer called a traitor. and general haughs deputy, wendy noble, was close to james clapper, a former director of national intelligence and fierce critic of mr. trump. people close to general haugh said he did not know how he ended up in ms. loomers cross hairs. he was traveling in japan when the pentagon told him that his services would no longer be needed, without any further explanation, according to two former u.s. officials. white house officials did not respond to questions about the meeting. in a statement, the white house press secretary, karoline leavitt, said president trump has assembled a great team of people who work tirelessly to better our country. as we have always said, and the president maintained last night when speaking with reporters on air force one, he continues to have confidence in mike waltz and his national security team. during mr. trumps first term, some aides, in particular john f. kelly, the former marine general who was the presidents longest-serving chief of staff, spent a large portion of their days blocking off people they described as the crazies. but by the end of 2020, those efforts had entirely broken down. mr. trump had fired his gatekeepers, or they had resigned in disgust, and a parade of fringe figures had easy access to the oval office. people eager to feed into his belief that the november presidential race had been stolen from him had freewheeling access to mr. trump in the final weeks of his first term. they included mike lindell, the chief executive of mypillow, and sidney powell, a former federal prosecutor who spread wild conspiracy theories about foreign interference in the 2020 election. with mr. trump now more confident in his executive power and instincts and bolstered by a team that shares his sense of persecution, there is no pretense that he can be controlled or managed. the door to the oval office is wide open and seated just outside it is natalie harp, a former far-right television presenter who lives in the internets fever swamps and is deeply devoted to the president. ms. loomer was not alone with the president during the meeting on wednesday. also in the room at various points were vice president jd vance susie wiles, the chief of staff howard lutnick, the commerce secretary and sergio gor, the head of presidential personnel. at some point, they were joined by representative scott perry of pennsylvania, a congressman who, like ms. powell and mr. lindell, was a key player in mr. trumps efforts to cling to power after his 2020 loss. mr. perry was appointed months ago to the house intelligence committee, giving him a level of visibility into intelligence and activities in mr. trumps government, including inside some of the agencies under discussion in the meeting. but while mr. perry is an elected lawmaker, ms. loomer, who twice ran unsuccessfully for congress, is the kind of blunt-force operative that mr. trump has been drawn to since 1973, when he hired roy m. cohn, first as a lawyer and then as a mentor and fixer. ms. loomer calls roger j. stone jr., another of mr. cohns acolytes and mr. trumps longest-serving political adviser, her mentor. but while mr. stone had worked for mainstream political candidates over several decades and mr. cohn was close with top levels of business and political elites, ms. loomer, just 31, had operated entirely on the fringes until mr. trumps first presidency. and in her version of political warfare, nothing is out of bounds. during the 2024 republican primary contest, when she was arguably mr. trumps most aggressive online advocate, she floated the baseless conspiracy theory that the wife of his rival, gov. ron desantis of florida, had faked her breast cancer. mr. trump and some in his orbit view ms. loomer as a talented researcher, capable of finding dirt others cannot, or will not, excavate. and mr. trump has long liked having allies who are willing to lob attacks that even he might consider too risky, allowing the president to distance himself. ms. loomer has fashioned herself as a loyalty enforcer from outside the administration, but she has solid enough relationships inside to be added to mr. trumps calendar for a meeting. several weeks ago, she incorporated an opposition research firm called loomered strategies, and frequently posts information on social media to discredit and question the loyalty of people working for mr. trump. recently, she has focused on targeting judges who have opposed mr. trump and named several administration staff members she insisted were subversive or didnt belong there. in the days before the meeting originally scheduled for monday but moved when she couldnt get to washington in time ms. loomer had posted about several n.s.c. aides she insisted needed to be removed. shortly after, the n.s.c. began sending some of those people back to their home agencies. typically, in previous administrations, the n.s.c. staff does not go through the presidential personnel vetting process that other aides do. but in this iteration of the trump white house, n.s.c. staff members were vetted by administration officials. one hire was stopped midway through the hiring process when mr. trumps personnel team discovered the person had been somewhat critical about the pro-trump riot at the capitol on jan. 6, 2021. but the intense focus on who is deemed loyal and who isnt has been a factor since the transition. the criteria are often confusing, with senior officials sending mixed messages in public and private. on thursday, ms. loomer defended mr. gor on the social media site x, saying, sergio is 100 correct to implement loyalty oaths. leave sergio alone! speaking to reporters aboard air force one on thursday, the president insisted that ms. loomer had nothing to do with the firings. but he also said, she makes recommendations of things and people, and sometimes i listen to those recommendations. reached by phone in los angeles on friday morning, ms. loomer advocated even more dismissals. in my opinion president trump should re-evaluate his entire national security council, she said as she prepared for a deposition of the tv host bill maher. ms. loomer sued the comedian for defamation in october, because of remarks he had made on air about her relationship with mr. trump. she added that if the president still has confidence in michael waltzs ability to be an effective n.s.c. director, then michael waltz needs to either take a course on vetting or learn to do a better job at vetting. julian e. barnes contributed reporting.

  Title: Why Pete Hegseth’s Troubles Are Giving Republicans Serious Heartburn
  Source: time.com (2025-04-22 19:20:35)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: This situation can be viewed through the lens of the Principal-Agent Problem. The text highlights President Trump (the principal) facing challenges controlling Secretary Hegseth's (the agent) actions, particularly regarding information handling ('shared military targets... from his personal phone'). The leaks ('fallout of news', 'leaked information') serve as imperfect monitoring mechanisms, revealing the agent's behavior to the principal and public. The interpretation is that the principal struggles to ensure the agent acts in the organization's best interest, complicated by information asymmetry and the principal's own political calculations regarding loyalty versus competence.; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is clearly at play here. The article details how reports from specific media outlets ('New York Times on Sunday published a bombshell story', 'NBC News reported on Tuesday') have brought Hegseth's actions and the state of the Pentagon to the forefront of political discussion. This media focus ('constant pummeling', 'growing sense', 'Republicans are bracing', 'Democrats are planning') forces political actors to react and address issues they might otherwise prefer to ignore, demonstrating the media's power in shaping the political agenda.; Intriguing_angles: The article states the White House 'has not disputed the accuracy of those stories, only the interpretation about just how bad they are.' This textual clue is significant because it indicates the administration concedes the factual basis of the reports but seeks to control the narrative around their severity. What criteria are being used to judge the 'badness' of sharing sensitive information, if not the inherent risk? Could this framing prioritize political damage control over the substance of national security breaches?; Intriguing_angles: The text recalls Hegseth's difficult confirmation, noting past reports of 'alcohol abuse, hush money... sexual assault allegation, and organizational mismanagement' and a 'dead tie' vote with opposition from key figures like McConnell. This historical context, presented alongside current issues, suggests a pattern of concerning behavior and significant political resistance predating his tenure. How do these persistent concerns about character and competence influence the current debate about his leadership and fitness for office?

  Content: this article is part of the d.c. brief, times politics newsletter. sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. the knives are out for defense secretary pete hegseth. while top white house officials insist the growing questions surrounding the defense secretarys behavior is proof hes threatening the status quo, the sentiment across much of the capital is far less charitable. amid the fallout of news that he shared military targets to a second group chat, this time from his personal phone and to family members, there is a growing sense that the former fox news weekend host is poised to be one of the first senior members of the administration to be shown the exit. the only real question at this point is the length of trumps fuse amid the constant pummeling hegseth and others are facing for being so reckless with highly sensitive information that, in another timeline, could have cost americans their lives. by tuesday afternoon, it seemed this might well be a slow burn. the new york times on sunday published a bombshell story that revealed hegseth last month shared flight schedules for fa-18 hornets en route to bomb iranian-backed houthis in yemen with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. nbc news reported on tuesday that hegseth had shared that info after receiving it from a top u.s. general using a secure u.s. government system intended for sensitive and classified information. privately, republicans are bracing for further embarrassing disclosures in the wings, as first reported by notus. many in the party never really liked the former tv personality for the role of running the worlds largest employer. the department of defense employs more than 3 million people in military or civilian roles. his confirmation hearings dealt with reports of alcohol abuse, hush money to settle a sexual assault allegation, and organizational mismanagement with a veterans group. his confirmation vote was a dead tie in the senate, requiring vice president j.d. vance to drag hegseth across the finish line past unified democratic opposition and nay votes from sen. mitch mcconnell, the influential former republican leader, and sens. lisa murkowski of alaska and susan collins of maine. since breezing into the pentagon with promises of de-woke-ifying and re-warrior-izing, hegseths tenure hasnt exactly been confidence inspiring. national security hawks in both parties are watching the pentagon for daily dust-ups that shake americas image and remake its top ranks. he was sharing bombing details on a first group chat that somehow included the top editor of the atlantic, and then on another one with his family. his inner circle was dismantled last week, ostensibly over leaked information about a pending briefing on china for elon musk. and hegseths top spokesman went rogue and published a highly critical assessment of the secretarys tenure in short, the building is in disarray under hegseths leadership. hill republicans are begrudgingly grateful that the news of the second group chat emerged while most are out of town, at home for a holiday work period that continues through this week. but several lawmakers have been using their best stage whisper to urge leadership teams in the house and senate that this sort of sloppy handling of sensitive information cannot become normalized. so far, just one republican lawmakerformer air force general and current rep. don bacon of nebraskahas put his name on pointed criticism of hegseth but there is a sense that the time for choosing will come when congress comes back next week. its going to get tougher to stay silent, especially as democrats are planning a coordinated effort to suss out just how trump administration officials are using third-party platforms like signal and gmail to potentially skirt keeping a full record of their correspondence. yet even some republicans tired of hegseth are wary of seeing him pushed out. after all, as one republican who helped hegseth salvage his nomination told me, there is little reason to think trump would turn to a polished pro for that role now, or that a quick confirmation process is in the offing. a hegseth-run dod may look positively orderly compared to what follows, some fear. at the white house, a tone of public defiance has settled in. trump and hegseth spoke just hours after the times report went online sunday and they seemed simpatico in a belief that the revelations were coming from disgruntled employees and so-called deep state defenders of business as usual. but the contradiction was apparent for anyone willing to scratch the surface the three public suspensions and one defection from the pentagons top ranks were all, until very recently, hegseth loyalists. its not clear that they would have been behind the leak about hegseths chat history and its worth noting that the white house has not disputed the accuracy of those stories, only the interpretation about just how bad they are. for his part, hegseth returned to the morning show he hosted for years to bat away the furor, but noticeably did not deny the underlying story, either. once a leaker, always a leaker, often a leaker, hegseth said tuesday. i dont have time for leakers. i dont have time for the hoax press that peddles old stories from disgruntled employees. speaking to reporters on tuesday afternoon, white house press secretary karoline leavitt called the latest reports part of a smear campaign against a change agent and again denied reporting that says those close to trump are looking for a replacement. instead, she cast all of this as a betrayalby the people who told the times about the signal group chat in the first place, suggesting they would be held to criminal account. we are not going to tolerate individuals who leaked to the mainstream media, particularly when it comes to sensitive information, leavitt said. the president stands strongly behind secretary hegseth and the change that he is bringing to the pentagon. the results he has achieved thus far speak for themselves. that may be the case at present, but betting on trump to stay the course is seldom a good wager. republicans who have spoken with the white house say trump is committed to keeping hegseth, although there is the long-running understanding that the presidents loyalty is inviolable until it isnt. during his first term, trump dumped just about anyone at any timefor bringing bad headlines, for getting headlines that were too good, for inching too close to the spotlight, or bumping trump from the front page. this time, trump seems determined not to give his critics a single win, doubling down when other presidents would have ditched the trouble. remember when barack obama ditched the top general in afghanistan for a series of disparaging comments to rolling stone about his team? stanley mccrystal sure does. so, for now, there is merely the constant glare on hegseth, who seems to be atop a fast-flaking camp of defenders. trump, who has made this his weekly waterloo, has stood by cabinet officials far longer with far less threatening incoming. now, washington is just waiting to see where a second-term trump has parked his pain threshold. with reporting by nik popli make sense of what matters in washington. sign up for the d.c. brief newsletter.

  Title: The Cardboard-Carrying Opposition Arrives
  Source: www.theatlantic.com (2025-04-05 18:30:00)
  Content: the hands off protest in washington, d.c., drew thousands of people with a lot of feelingsbut as-yet-inchoate anger at the trump administration. the opposition arrived in a flurry of painted cardboard. until this week, the 11th of donald trumps second presidency, the resistance has not exactly been uppercase r. any show of dissent by democratic leadership has been virtually nonexistent, and protests against trumps policies have been small and sporadic. citizen frustration with the new administration has registered nationally as little more than a distant rumble. todays hands off protest, organized by a coalition of left-wing groups, was an attempt to raise the volume. people carted their megaphones and rainbow flags to more than 1,200 sites across the country todayin d.c., of course, but also in helena, montana daytona beach, florida and dubuque, iowa. the events spanned all 50 states, the organizers said, plus a few more exotic locales, such as guadalajara, lisbon, and paris. washington had expected to draw about 10,000 protesters in the end, several times that showed up. in interviews with some of those gathered today on the national mall, demonstrators told me that they were under no illusion that trump or elon musk would be much swayed by their anger or creative signage. the point, they said, was to show the rest of america that the opposition existsand is widespread. this is not for them, gina king, a retired teacher from new york city, told me. this is for us. the first mass protest of this administration was well timed. the week began with cory bookers record-breaking 25-hour tirade against trump from the senate floor. the monologue accomplished nothing tangiblethough it threw bookers oura-ring readings out of whackbut it was a welcome stunt for voters who have been craving louder public rage against the administrations actions. what says outrage more than a man willing to hold it for 25 hours? then, on tuesday night, democrats in wisconsin won the first electoral test of trumps second presidency, by defeating a state-supreme-court candidate backed by trump and 20 million from musk. also on tuesday, one of the largest mass layoffs of federal workers to date began, when employees at the cdc and the fda were dismissed. finally, on thursday, trumps tariffs sent americans retirement savings plunging, triggered manufacturer layoffs, and forced cnbc to bring its bear-market graphic out of hibernation. king, the retired teacher, carried a sign thanking booker and wisconsinites for their efforts in the fight against trump. she protested the president during the womens march in early 2017, but this political moment is different, she told me. it feels more desperate, she said. we should all be standing in front of the supreme court every day, in front of the national institutes of health every day. half a dozen federal employees spoke with me at the protest, but none wanted to share their full name for fear of retribution from the trump administration. im here because i feel powerless, said a man named edward, who had just been forced out of his longtime government job. he carried a sign mocking the five bullet points that federal employees are now required to submit weekly to musks doge. in the original womens march, we were very concerned with womens rights, but now hes touching all areas, tracie, an employee in the department of veterans affairs, told me. she was willing to risk her job to show up at the protest, together with her daughter and granddaughter, she told me, because she wants america to see her anger. the administration is completely discounting us. theyre saying were bought, were paid for, were bused in. but the opposition to trump is real, she said. we are out here. on the mall, it was difficult to pinpoint a chief complaint or singular demand. hands off what, exactly? i asked. there were so many things to be furious about. no single piece of cardstock could contain it all. people carried posters about the administrations deportation of immigrants and dissident students laura loomers oval office influence musks taking a chain saw to the federal government the return of preventable diseases the technological ineptitude of trumps defense officials and attacks on abortion rights. many of those i spoke with cited creeping fascism. theres been a total disregard of habeas corpus, larry bostian, a retiree from silver spring, maryland, told me. democracy is in a death spiral. paul singleton, an air force veteran from stafford, virginia, agreed. i used to wonder, how did hitler do what he did? he said. when trump got into office and started appointing all these people, i stopped. given the stakes, people wanted to know, where was democratic party leadership? katrin hinrichsen, a retired computer engineer from connecticut, had brought a few signage options, including one that read time to chuck schumer. i want some effective leadership of the democratic minority, she told me. a few democratic lawmakers addressed the rally in d.c., including representatives jamie raskin of maryland and ilhan omar of minnesota. they were speaking on a stage somewhere amid the dense crowd gathered at the base of the washington monument. but most people couldnt hear them some had no idea there was a stage at all. instead, parts of the rally devolved into a kind of hippie picnic, where sign carriers chatted in circles or plopped on the grass to eat sandwiches. one woman handed out nuts and dried fruit cashews, anyone? another laughed with her friendsthe last time i felt safe in a crowd this big was at a taylor swift concert! weve been scattered weve been demoralized, bostian, the retiree from silver spring, told me, looking at the sea of people around him. but this is awesome. the 2017 womens march connected protesters who kept in touch, established resistance groups in their hometowns, and eventually helped elect a wave of new democrats during the 2018 midterms. todays protesters think that they can do it again. they just need the rest of america to hear them.

  Title: ‘None of this is based in reality’: Hegseth blames fired staffers for leaks and trying to sabotage Trump’s agenda
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 16:26:27)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Principal-Agent Theory, the article highlights potential agency problems within the executive branch. The text notes President Trump's continued support for Secretary Hegseth despite reports of operational security breaches and internal chaos described by former aide John Ullyot. This suggests a potential misalignment where the agent's (Hegseth's) actions or the environment under their control (Pentagon 'meltdown') may not align with the principal's (Trump's) stated goals or interests, raising questions about oversight and loyalty within the administration.; Theories_and_interpretations: The narrative demonstrates aspects of Agenda-Setting Theory. Reports from organizations like the New York Times, Politico, and NPR regarding the Signal chats and internal dissent bring these issues to the forefront of public and political discussion. The article shows how these media reports directly trigger responses from key figures like Hegseth, Trump, Bacon, and Leavitt, illustrating the media's power to elevate specific events and influence the political agenda surrounding the Defense Secretary's position.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents a direct contradiction regarding the state of the Pentagon under Hegseth. Hegseth claims he is "reestablishing standards and accountability," while former aide Ullyot describes "total chaos" and a "full-blown meltdown." Significance: This stark divergence, presented without independent verification within the text, forces the reader to weigh competing, irreconcilable accounts of the department's functioning, potentially reflecting a struggle for control over the narrative surrounding Hegseth's leadership. Probing Questions: What specific actions or conditions does Hegseth point to as evidence of 'reestablishing standards'? What specific events or conditions does Ullyot cite as evidence of 'chaos' and 'meltdown' beyond the leaks themselves?; Intriguing_angles: The repeated emphasis by both Hegseth and Trump on "disgruntled former employees" as the source of the leaks is noteworthy. Textual Basis: Hegseth blames "fired staffers" and "disgruntled former employees" for trying to "sabotage the presidents agenda," a point echoed by Trump who dismisses reports as "fake news" from "disgruntled employees." Significance: This framing attempts to discredit the leaked information by attributing it to personal vendettas rather than potential systemic issues or legitimate concerns about conduct or security, potentially diverting attention from the content of the leaks themselves. Probing Questions: What specific actions or policies under Hegseth might have led to employees becoming 'disgruntled'? Does the article provide any information that might corroborate or contradict the claim that the leaks are solely motivated by sabotage?

hegseth has blamed fired staffers for the leaks about the second signal chat group he created about strikes against houthis in yemen, as he accused them of trying to sabotage president donald trumps agenda. hegseth is fighting to hold onto his position after a bombshell report that he shared details of military strikes in yemen in another signal chat that included his own wife and brother. none of this is based in reality, hegseth said during an appearance on tuesdays fox friends, where he worked as co-host for the best part of a decade. when asked whether the report was leaked as a way to get back at him, hegseth agreed. those folks who are leaking, who have been pushed out of the building, are now attempting to leak and sabotage the presidents agenda, hegseth said. were for the war fighters. were for the president. and none of this is based in reality. open image in gallery pete hegseth is fighting to hold onto his position after a bombshell report that he shared details of military strikes in yemen in another signal chat that included his own wife and brother. he spoke about his recent missteps during a tuesday interview on fox friends fox hegseth characterized the plans that were shared in the signal group chats as informal, unclassified coordination for what he said was media coordination of events. he also claimed he was reestablishing standards and accountability at the pentagon. the warfighters are behind us. our enemies know they are on notice, hegseth said. our allies know we are behind them, and that, in this dangerous world, for the american people, is what it is all about. the new york times first reported the details of the second signal group chat, which included flight schedules for the warplanes involved in the march operation, and reported that hegseth used his personal phone. hegseth shifted the blame to disgruntled former employees while speaking to reporters in a defiant display monday at the white house easter egg roll event. they take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees, and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations, hegseth said. not going to work with me, because were changing the defense department, putting the pentagon back in the hands of war fighters and anonymous smears from disgruntled former employees on old news doesnt matter. hegseths job appears safe for now after trump continues to stand by him and dismissed the report. its just fake news. they just bring up stories, trump said monday. i guess it sounds like disgruntled employees. he was put there to get rid of a lot of bad people and thats what hes doing so you dont always have friends when you do that. open image in gallery hegseth blasted disgruntled former employees who he claimed were behind the reports of the second signal group chat. the defense secretary was animated as he defended himself at the white house easter egg roll event monday. epa the embattled defense secretarys denial follows explosive claims by a recently resigned pentagon aide that the department is experiencing a full-blown meltdown under his leadership. john ullyot, who resigned last week as a pentagon spokesperson, described a month of total chaos under hegseth. chaos inside the pentagon is now a major distraction for the president, ullyot wrote in the scathing politico op-ed. president donald trump has a strong record of holding his officials to account, ullyot said. given that, its hard to see secretary of defense pete hegseth remaining in his position for much longer. responding to ullyots claims, hegseth accused him of misrepresenting the situation at the pentagon. we did right by him, we tried to help, hegseth said on fox friends of ulloyt. hes spinning it otherwise. while democrats bolted out of the gate to call for hegseths resignation, nebraska rep. don bacon became the first house republican to suggest that trump should fire hegseth. bacon pointed out that if a democrat did this, wed be demanding a scalp in stern words to politico. the military should always pride itself on operational security. if the reports are true, the secretary of defense has failed at operational security, and that is unacceptable, bacon, a member of the house armed services committee, also told axios. meanwhile, white house press secretary karoline leavitt issued a swift denial of an npr report monday claiming that a search is underway to replace hegseth following the second signal chat fiasco. she called the npr report total fake news based on one anonymous source who clearly has no idea what they are talking about. it emerged last month that hegseth texted sensitive war plans involving a wave of u.s. air strikes in yemen in a signal chat called houthi pc small group that inadvertently included the atlantic editor-in-chief jeffrey goldberg. the chat was created by trumps national security adviser mike waltz.

  Title: In Trump 2.0, the mistakes are multiplying - CNN
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 22:19:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The recurring theme of internal conflicts and personnel changes, such as the 'purge of Hegseth loyalists' and Gary Shapley's departure after Scott Bessent 'complained about being cut out of the process,' aligns with **Bureaucratic Politics Theory**. This theory posits that policy outcomes are often the result of bargaining and competition among different actors within the government bureaucracy, each pursuing their own interests and perspectives. The text suggests that these internal dynamics, rather than just simple mistakes, contribute significantly to the administration's operational challenges and potentially influence policy execution, as seen in the handling of the IRS and Pentagon affairs.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article's description of the administration's actions regarding climate findings, social programs (Head Start, home heating oil), and disaster relief funding, particularly the note about speeding money to 'GOP-led states,' can be viewed through the lens of **Public Choice Theory**. This theory suggests that political actors, like bureaucrats and politicians, are primarily motivated by self-interest (e.g., re-election, power, budget maximization) rather than purely public interest. The specific examples provided in the text, such as prioritizing funding for politically aligned states or targeting programs that may not serve core political constituencies, could be interpreted as actions driven by political or partisan self-interest rather than an objective assessment of public need or scientific findings.; Intriguing_angles: The article explicitly contrasts 'high-profile mistakes' and 'unforced errors' with actions the administration 'does on purpose,' listing examples like minimizing climate findings and directing funds to GOP states. The textual basis is the sentence: 'Its ultimately what the administration does on purpose that might worry Trumps critics more than a perception of sloppiness.' This juxtaposition is significant because it subtly reframes the narrative from one of mere incompetence (errors) to one potentially involving deliberate, politically motivated actions. Could the emphasis on 'errors' earlier in the article serve to downplay or distract from the potentially more concerning 'on purpose' actions described later?

      > Snippet: high-profile mistakes and the ensuing headaches are piling up for president donald trumps administration.
  Content: a version of this story appeared in cnns what matters newsletter. to get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. high-profile mistakes and the ensuing headaches are piling up for president donald trumps administration. it was an administrative error that led to the mistaken deportation of a maryland man and kicked off the most visible legal challenge to trumps deportation policy, at least so far. the supreme court ruled the white house must facilitate the return of kilmar abrego garcia, but the white house has made no real effort to bring him back to the us. it was the mistaken addition of a reporter to a signal chat by trumps national security adviser that first uncovered the sharing of sensitive information by his defense secretary pete hegseth. the signal chat mistake seemed to have blown over, but then drama returned to the pentagon with a purge of hegseth loyalists still new in their jobs. now there are reports that hegseth had shared sensitive information in a second signal chat. it was the sending of a letter, perhaps by mistake, that kicked off a legal fight with harvard. that most recent incident, reported by the new york times, is not something the white house has acknowledged as an error, but administration officials have said the letter did not achieve its original goal, which apparently was not for harvard to file a lawsuit against trumps administration. it was a letter that was intended to have both parties sit down again and continue their negotiations, education secretary linda mcmahon said on cnbc tuesday. the letter, which was signed by three different government officials, was legitimate, but maybe sent too soon. there have been multiple acting irs commissioners in less than 100 days of trumps second administration. some quit in protest when the administration decided to give tax data to immigration officials. the most recent acting commissioner to leave, gary shapley, was a whistleblower at the irs and alleged the justice department slow-walked an investigation of president joe bidens son hunter. shapley was out within a few days, apparently after treasury secretary scott bessent complained about being cut out of the process. it was not a mistake when trump announced retaliatory tariffs, which have since been paused for all countries but china. but the large board trump used to argue his case included wild figures that confused economists. markets responded favorably tuesday after the wall street journal reported bessent told investors he believes the trade war with china will de-escalate. the white house also sought to reassure wall street and americans when press secretary karoline leavitt told reporters at a white house press briefing tuesday that the administration has made progress in reaching the outlines of new trade agreements with 18 countries. its not clear when any new deals might be finalized. sen. john kennedy, the louisiana republican, gave the administration some backhanded support on meet the press sunday when he said the mistaken deportation of abrego garcia was a screwup but did not represent a pattern of mistaken deportations. there is clearly an emerging pattern of unforced errors that are complicating trumps already controversial and divisive policies. the abrego garcia case humanized the mass deportation effort, even if he currently seems unlikely ever to return to the us. hegseths signal problem and the merry-go-round of acting irs commissioners highlight that trump brought in outsiders to disrupt the federal bureaucracy. harvards lawsuit is being cheered by those who fear the impacts of trumps effort to cut research funding and strong-arm universities to cut down on campus protests and chill dissent. mistakes are built into the dna of the ad hoc department of government efficiency led by elon musk. nobodys going to bat a thousand, musk said in the oval office in february. we will make mistakes, but we will act quickly to correct any mistakes. musk admitted to at least one. one of the things we accidentally canceled, very briefly, was ebola prevention. i think we all want ebola prevention, he said at a cabinet meeting, although independent reports have questioned whether the aid is in fact flowing again. musk did not acknowledge other doge mistakes, like the firing and then rehiring of government workers focused on nuclear safety in texas and power grid security in the pacific northwest. other workers appeared to be fired indiscriminately, but were told it was because of their performance. after a decision by a judge in california, they may now be re-fired. trumps efforts to shrink the government are not over there is an expectation that multiple agencies will continue with reduction in force efforts to further cull the number of federal workers. its ultimately what the administration does on purpose that might worry trumps critics more than a perception of sloppiness. here are a few cnn reports from recent days the administration appears to have minimized federal climate scientists findings of record carbon dioxide growth in the atmosphere, for instance. trumps budget proposal targets head start and home heating oil programs that could hurt american children and seniors who need assistance. at a time when disaster relief money is stalled, the trump administration sped money to gop-led states, according to another cnn report.

    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
