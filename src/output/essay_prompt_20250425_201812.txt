  Title: Karen Read's second murder trial revives debate over who killed her Boston police officer boyfriend
  Source: abcnews.go.com (2025-04-22 00:14:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article highlights the prosecution's focus on 'drinking, driving, deadly consequences,' echoing a common public safety narrative. This suggests an attempt to frame the case in a way that resonates with pre-existing public concerns, potentially influencing jury perception and minimizing focus on the defense's conspiracy claims.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the defense was prevented from implicating Colin Albert in their opening statements. This is intriguing because it suggests a limitation on the defense's ability to present their full case. What is the justification for this limitation, and how might it impact the jury's perception of the defense's claims?

  Title: Spain unveils €11bn plan to reach long-delayed Nato defence spending target
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-22 13:24:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: Spain's increased defense spending, spurred by pressure from NATO and the perceived threat from Russia ('vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security'), aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize their security in an anarchic international system. This action demonstrates a shift towards self-reliance and power balancing within Europe.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Spain's commitment to increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP, but also mentions criticism from coalition partners who describe the plans as 'incoherent and absolutely exorbitant.' This suggests internal political divisions regarding defense priorities and resource allocation. What are the specific concerns of the coalition partners, and how might these internal disagreements affect the implementation and effectiveness of the defense plan?

  Content: spain has announced a 10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed nato commitment of spending 2 of its gdp on defence this year, saying it has become obvious only europe will know how to protect europe from now on. the country which lags well behind other western nations by dedicating about 1.3 of its gdp to defence spending is one of the nato members that has been pressured by the trump administration to increase its spending, and had previously committed to hitting the 2 threshold by 2029. but speaking on tuesday morning, spains prime minister, pedro sánchez, unveiled a 10.5bn 9bn industrial and technological plan for security and defence that will allow spain to meet the 2 commitment in 2025. sánchez said the plan, which has been approved by his cabinet and will now be submitted to the eu and nato, was needed to address the current and future defence challenges. its main focus will be telecommunications, cybersecurity and buying military equipment. the enemies of europe are not just using missiles as we have seen in ukraine over the past three years, he said. theyre also using unmanned drones and paramilitary forces to sabotage supply chains and to cut gas lines and underwater cables. theyre using social networks to issue disinformation and to polarise people and spread disaffection towards democratic institutions. theyre using ai cyber-attacks and quantum computers to compromise out telecommunications, our supply networks, and our public services in order to target our way of life. the prime minister who pointed out that his administration was finally making good on the 2 commitment pledged by its conservative predecessor in 2014 said the new plan would help reinforce european security in record time. in a world thats dominated by uncertainty, europe is hope and it is certainty and that certainty must be protected by strengthening our security and defence systems because given whats going on, its obvious that only europe will know how to protect europe, he added. and spain will contribute to protecting europe. sánchez said vladimir putins neo-imperialism was a threat to european security, no matter how far any eu member state was from the frontlines of the conflict in ukraine. the security and stability of ukraine, of eastern europe and the baltic and nordic countries, is also the security and the safety of spain, he said. the people who live in those countries know that putin is serious and that his words are backed by deeds and thats why they look to europe for protection. theyre looking for something important, and that is unity. spain will not be indifferent to that demand. ukraine resists, europe responds and spain fulfils its obligations. sánchez also repeated his assurances that the additional spending would not lead to increased taxes, raids on the welfare state budget, or deficit increases. the plan has faced criticism from coalition partners in the leftwing sumar platform, who described the plans as incoherent and absolutely exorbitant. in january, donald trump increased pressure on nato, claiming the us had shouldered the global defence burden for too long and saying he would ask all nato members to increase defence spending to 5 of gdp. the nato secretary-general, mark rutte, has urged member states to use the threats from washington as an incentive to take unilateral action on raising defence contributions. last month, rutte said the pressure was already paying off in countries such as spain, portugal, belgium and italy. i tell them that, well, now i am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2 by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2 because we have to spend much, much more than 2 but now i am calling you, but you might get a very, erm, patient man from washington on the line if you dont listen to me, he said.

  Title: Is Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated (CORT) Among the Best Guru Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts?
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-23 17:17:07)
  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. we recently published a list of 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. in this article, we are going to take a look at where corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort stands against other guru stocks to invest in. wall street seems to be breathing a little easier after the initial panic over president trumps tariffs earlier this month, but the rollercoaster is not over just yet. all three major indexes closed last week in the red, with the dow and nasdaq both dipping over 2, and the broader market down more than 1. even though markets remain closed on april 18 for good friday, the general consensus is that the worst of the trade war headlines might be dying down. marko papic, chief strategist of geomacro strategy at bca research, remains cautiously optimistic, noting that while the idea of president trump striking 90 trade deals in 90 days sounds ambitious, they will likely be small, symbolic wins that still help calm markets. that said, volatility is expected to continue, and papic predicts the broader market could dip again before bouncing back, potentially giving investors a buying opportunity. investors are deep in earnings season right now, and some of wall streets biggest banks have reported solid first-quarter results. a big part of their success came from their trading desks, which cashed in on the recent market volatility, especially in equities. however, despite strong numbers on paper, bank ceos remain cautious and are hesitant to make big moves right now because of the market uncertainty. the us dollar also just had its worst weekly performance since 2022. meanwhile, investors are playing it safe and rapidly buying bonds, which pushed the 10-year treasury yield down to around 4.28. while some investors are seeing the current market dip as a buying opportunity, daniel von ahlen from globaldata ts lombard says otherwise. he believes the risks of a recession are being seriously underestimated. even though trumps recent tariff halt gave markets a bit of a boost, ahlen thinks that bounce will not last. in his view, this is not the time to scoop up stocks on the cheap, he is actually advising people to sell into rallies and avoid the usual buy-the-dip strategy. ahlen suggests getting a bit more cautious and selective. instead of jumping into the whole market, he recommends focusing on defensive sectors, like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare, that tend to hold up better in downturns. the market uncertainty is reflected in etfs as well, which are often considered wiser investment options due to active management strategies and lower risk compared to individual investing. for example, the guru etf is down 8.30 year-to-date as of april 18. however, over the last 12 months, the fund has posted share price returns of 13.38. similarly, five-year share returns stand at an impressive 51.57. guru gives retail investors a way to tap into the top stock picks of major hedge funds at a relatively low 0.75 expense ratio. it offers a more affordable and flexible way to try and beat the broader market using expert insights. so, lets take a look at the best guru stocks to buy. a biologist in a lab coat studying a culture of cells to find a cure for metabolic disorders. for this article, we looked up the guru etf, which had 82 holdings as of april 18. next, we manually searched for the average upside potential of each stock and selected 11 stocks with the highest values. the list below is ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of april 18. we have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment as of q4 2024. why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

  Title: Bank of England rate-setter says US tariffs likely to push down on inflation
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 11:13:59)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article touches upon aspects of Realism in international relations, specifically concerning trade and tariffs. The US imposing tariffs on the UK, as mentioned in the text ('the us has imposed a 10 import tariff on goods coming from the uk, a policy which also applies to many other countries'), exemplifies a state acting in its perceived self-interest to protect its economy, regardless of the impact on other nations. This action, and the UK's subsequent economic considerations, reflect the competitive and often conflictual nature of international trade relations as described by Realist theory.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents Megan Greene's analysis of potential disinflationary effects of US tariffs on the UK, but also acknowledges 'a tonne of uncertainty around this.' This uncertainty, coupled with the mention of 'both inflationary and disinflationary forces,' suggests a more complex and potentially volatile economic situation than a simple cause-and-effect narrative. What specific factors contribute most to this uncertainty, and how might they interact to produce unexpected economic outcomes?; Intriguing_angles: The opening section discusses the importance of 'parsing out the facts from the messaging' in the context of US politics, while the latter part focuses on economic analysis of UK inflation. This juxtaposition, while seemingly unrelated, could subtly imply that economic narratives are also subject to manipulation or biased framing. To what extent might political messaging influence the interpretation and presentation of economic data, and what mechanisms might facilitate such influence?

  Title: SURVEY: Half Americans Have Given Up On Saving Money...
  Source: studyfinds.org (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights the prevalence of financial insecurity among Americans, influencing public perception and potentially shaping policy priorities. The repeated emphasis on savings shortfalls and reliance on savings for emergencies, "67 of americans feel theyre lagging behind their savings targets. even worse, 47 have completely given up hope," frames the issue as a widespread problem. This can lead to increased public concern and demand for solutions.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Gen Z's relatively high satisfaction with their banks (71%) but also their willingness to switch (45%). This juxtaposition is intriguing because it suggests a potential disconnect between perceived satisfaction and actual loyalty. What specific factors, beyond those mentioned, might be driving Gen Z's willingness to switch banks despite their reported satisfaction? Could this indicate a deeper dissatisfaction with certain aspects of banking services that aren't fully captured by the satisfaction metric?

calls the unveiling of its new trade policy is finally upon us. but what it actually means and what the impact will be is still not clear, as president donald trump keeps businesses and world leaders waiting until wednesday to unveil the next round of tariffs. while mr trump has suggested all nations will be hit with additional levies and sir keir starmer has admitted the uk is unlikely to escape the new measures its still far from certain exactly which industries will bear the brunt this time, with steel, aluminium and auto parts already subject to additional import costs. heres a look at whats already known, what could happen, and what investors are doing as uncertainty reigns. the top end of the uk stock market has performed relatively well this year, considering concerns over growth, inflation, still-high interest rates and the wider geopolitical landscape. the ftse 100 is up more than 5 per cent year-to-date, in contrast to the us sp 500 being down around the same amount. the uncertainty has hit smaller businesses more, with the ftse 250 down 5.2 per cent in 2025 and the aim all-share index down 4.3 per cent. more recently, while there was a sell-off on monday ahead of these new tariffs, it eventually wasnt as steep as had initially looked the case and tuesday saw investors buying once more on price weaknesses, perhaps hinting that some saw limited further downside in share price terms, even with new tariffs to come. it has always been a fools game at guessing the stock markets most immediate, very next move, but aj bell analysis notes that while the biggest tech stocks in america the so-called magnificent seven have lost a combined 2.3 trillion in the first quarter of this year, they have strong growth prospects well into the future and that status makes them natural candidates to attract widespread buying when markets are more upbeat. in the uk, defence stocks in particular have fared strongly so far, with a domestic political strategy based on increased spending in this area pushing share prices higher while the price of gold, a traditional safe haven for investors, has repeatedly hit new record highs this year and is predicted by some analysts to rise even further across 2025. price hikes and job losses could have a total global economic toll of 1.4 trillion 1.1 trillion under the worst-case scenario according to aston business school. that is if full global retaliation with reciprocal tariffs is the eventual outcome, which would see the us economy in particular hit. naturally, if the entire planet is affected to that scale, the uk wouldnt be exempt, but theres still scope for changing trade paths, perhaps seeking out partners to increase back-and-forth business with if a reliance on the us is no longer plausible. quite aside from the businesses involved, government spending could also be impacted. last week, rachel reeves noted the government was laying out savings to restore 9.9bn of headroom for government expenditure. one assessment of a worst-case scenario involving trump tariffs and the uk suggests that would be entirely and immediately wiped out. david miles, from the office for budget responsibilitys obr budget responsibility committee, told mps if tariffs at 20 25 per cent were put on the uk and maintained for five years, our assessment of what that does is that it will knock out all the headroom that the government currently has. had we made that a central forecast, and had the government not changed policy at all knowing that we were going to take that as our central forecast, then the headroom would have pretty much all gone. mr miles noted the improbability of the extreme scenario, which would include a term beyond the next us presidential elections, but the obr further noted the hit to business confidence across the uk caused by the uncertainty around tariffs and other costs. at the other end of the scale, theres the perspective that some changes could in fact mean the uk might actually benefit from a trade war. again, its important to note thats on a broad, all-encompassing term there would still be businesses or industries negatively affected within that. but the obr noted that if the uk avoided involvement in a trade war, reciprocal tariffs and the like, some redirected trade flows could end up increasing business this side of the water. much of that is based around the fact that the uk-us trade deficit is far more reasonably balanced than, for example, the eu-us one. professor irina surdu-nardella, of warwick business school, told cnbc tariffs could yet have a limited impact on the uk. effects would be relatively limited to industries such as fishing and mining, ms surdu-nardella said, pointing to the service-focused nature of the uk economy meaning much of it would be unscathed by import tariffs. of course, theres also the possibility that mr trump and mr starmer find an agreement whereby british companies end up entirely unaffected by the whole process, potentially giving them a foothold to gain further business with overseas customers. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see

  Title: FTSE 100 share prices sink after Trump tariffs announcement as analysts warn of high US recession risk
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-03 08:56:55)
  Content: analysts warning of high risk us now enters recession this year after unveiling blanket global tariffs from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. the london stock exchange has opened sharply, down one per cent as a whole by 930am bst, in the wake of donald trump applying a ten per cent tariff to imported goods from the uk. that includes a small amount of ground recovered following an even steeper opening, while around europe there are even bigger drops in evidence, with germanys dax down 1.3 per cent and frances cac 40 down almost 1.7 per cent. the hardest hit sectors in the ftse 100 include banks and investment trusts, with standard chartered suffering the biggest drop in share price of 7.5 per cent in early morning trading. hsbc 5.0 per cent, barclays 4.4 per cent and lloyds 1.96 per cent also suffered hits in the finance sector. those falls suffered by investment trusts are partly related to their own holdings of overseas stocks, in particular those stateside. earlier, stock prices fell sharply overnight in the us following donald trumps announcement of global tariffs. a blanket 10 per cent starting point and significant increases on certain countries means imports into the us will be more costly with almost instant effect, impacting manufacturers and consumers alike. as a result of the tariff announcement, analysts at barclays are foreseeing a high risk of a recession in the us this year, as well as increased inflation up to or beyond four per cent and higher than expected unemployment levels. in the more immediate term, investors reacted by sending share prices significantly lower, with the futures markets showing entire indices pointing lower and individual companies even harder hit in many notable cases. the sp 500 and the nasdaq are both more than three per cent down in after-hours trading, while smaller companies seem even harder hit, the russell 2000 down 4.38 per cent around 730 am uk time. thats after japans nikkei 225 ended the day more than three per cent lower in overnight trading, hitting an eight-month low following a strong run over the previous couple of years. after each ended between flat and two per cent up in trading on wednesday, the futures market show the so-called magnificent seven - alphabet, microsoft, amazon, nvidia, apple, tesla and meta - highlighting the dramatic drops and negative market reaction to trumps latest and biggest bout of tariffs. microsoft is faring best among that notable giant group and is down 2.92 per cent in pre-trading, while most of the others are in the five-to-six per cent bracket down. apple, however, is hardest hit initially - with a 7.14 per cent decline equivalent to around 240 billion 183bn being wiped off its market capitalisation value overnight. lindsay james, investment strategist at quilter, pointed out that the president deliberately waited until after the closure of the stock market stateside to announce his tariffs. trump has made it clear that this is the end of the established economic order, and he wants america calling the shots. these tariffs are stark and perhaps more aggressive than many in the market had been expecting. indeed, trump scheduled this press conference for after the stock market closes for good reason, with the us futures market falling sharply as a result of this speech, ms james said. ultimately, trump is playing a high risk game. he is risking stoking a fresh inflationary spiral in the hope that over time jobs and industry are restored to the us. this is following an election campaign where he promised to lower inflation and bring interest rates down. but, tariffs have rarely ended in positive outcomes, and signs are already pointing to weakening consumer and business sentiment and the risk of a slowing us economy. trump continues to tout tax cuts, but there remains very little detail on what this means or when they will come about. additionally, ms quilter reinforced the likelihood of further ups and downs in the stock market across the coming weeks, with the possibility of donald trump changing his mind one factor to go along with the potential for retaliation. markets will be wanting more detail on both this and further deregulation, and given the scale of these tariffs that may need to come sooner rather than later for us equities. for businesses it remains a very volatile and uncertain economic period, and this will be reflected by markets for the time being. investors will need be patient and calm, staying invested for the long-term, she said. at barclays, meanwhile, the risk for recession stateside is heightened - but also higher inflation is likely, along with further job losses. we estimate that higher tariffs will boost price and exert a drag on activity. this is because tariffs raise the price of final and intermediate imported products, adversely affecting domestic consumers raise the cost of investment in equipment and infrastructure generally result in retaliation from other countries, which hurts exporters and are associated with trade policy uncertainty, which causes businesses to delay capex investment and hiring. in the face of weaker growth in activity and employment, the unemployment rate tends to increase, read a report by analysts including marc giannoni. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Trump ‘Liberation Day’ live: President set to unveil secret tariff plan as world braces for its economic impact
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-02 14:47:57)
  Content: all eyes are on president trump as he prepares to reveal the next phase of his sweeping tariff agenda, leaving global markets fearing a trade war from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters

other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. donald trump is preparing to unveil a raft of new tariffs on wednesday afternoon in what the president has repeatedly billed as liberation day. trump has promised to roll out reciprocal dollar-for-dollar tariffs on nations that levy duties on u.s. goods as part of an aggressive attempt to fulfill his administrations america first agenda and correct years of what he deems unfair trade. international markets wait tentatively as the president is expected to unveil his plans at 4 p.m. wednesday at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden at the moment american markets close. plans remain under wraps with trumps team reportedly weighing options through tuesday. however, white house press secretary karoline leavitt stated that the president had already decided his course of action and that the tariffs would go into effect almost immediately. the only way to avoid the new levies, she said, is to move production to the u.s. it follows the liberal candidate for a critical seat on the wisconsin supreme court, susan crawford, who defeated conservative brad schimel in a race seen as a referendum on trump and his billionaire adviser elon musk. former republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is on board with an effort by democrats in the upper chamber led by senators tim kaine, amy klobuchar, and mark warner to end donald trumps made-up emergency that the president has declared against canada allowing him authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on the u.s.s northern neighbor. trump claims the authority by declaring a national emergency caused by the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migration from canada as well as mexico and china. president trump is saying that there is an emergency with canada. canada is a friend, not an adversary. canada is a sovereign nation, not a 51st state, senator kaine of virginia said on tuesday. this morning, cnns haley talbot reports that the list of republicans who will vote yes on a tariffs resolution up for a vote today at around 7 p.m. has grown to include the former gop leader of the senate. kaine said he approached mcconnell last night and didnt even get to the question before the kentucky senator said im with you. other republicans in support of the move to at least symbolically rebuke the president on his trade policy just a few hours after his liberation day announcement on reciprocal tariffs expected to cover a large swathe of u.s. trading partners include senators susan collins, lisa murkowski, and rand paul. senator thom tillis also told cnn that he doesnt plan on voting for kaines resolution, but has some concerns with the trade policies being discussed, adding, we need to see what comes out tomorrow wednesday and be instructed by that before we take action. earlier, trump wrote in part on truth social mitch mcconnell of kentucky, susan collins of maine, lisa murkowski of alaska, and rand paul, also of kentucky, will hopefully get on the republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize canada for the sale, into our country, of large amounts of fentanyl, by tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy. they are playing with the lives of the american people, and right into the hands of the radical left democrats and drug cartels. the senate bill is just a ploy of the dems to show and expose the weakness of certain republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the house will never approve it and i, as your president, will never sign it. after breaking the record for the longest senate speech in history, cory booker now seems to have broken the internet, with a slew of praise, memes and even tiktok videos commemorating his mammoth achievement. the new jersey democrat took to the senate floor on monday evening, saying he would remain there as long as he was physically able. the speech lasted a whopping 25 hours and 5 minutes. mike bedigan looks at some of the online reactions. it was fitting that cory booker was recounting a story about the late civil rights leader john lewis as he entered the 19th minute and 24th hour of a historic speech to the senate on tuesday evening. in that moment, the first black senator for new jersey broke a record for the longest speech ever made in congress, one that was set 67 years ago by the segregationist democrat strom thurmond, who spoke for a day and a night in opposition to the civil rights act. overcome with emotion, booker looked up to the ceiling and touched his heart as his fellow democrats in the chamber applauded his effort. one of msnbcs morning joe hosts is delighting in the fact that the wisconsin supreme court candidate backed by elon musks lost - even after the tech mogul dumped millions into the race. wisconsin voters elected liberal justice susan crawford to the states supreme court on tuesday, beating brad schimel by more than 200,000 votes in the most expensive judicial election in u.s. history. the vote keeps the high courts 4-3 liberal majority intact. musk repeatedly played up the stakes of the election, claiming it will direct the destiny of humanity and the future of the world is at stake. now, morning joe host joe scarborough is reveling in the massive loss musk suffered. katie hawkinson reports from washington, d.c. the u.s. has sent a three-person team to myanmar to help respond to the 7.7-magnitude earthquake, in a move criticized as weak and irrelevant by a former aid official. much larger russian and chinese teams have already been helping search-and-rescue efforts in the country for days. steffie banatvala reports. a mother and her three children were wrongfully detained by immigration enforcement agents in new york and taken to a detention facility in texas, a nonprofit says as it calls for their release. immigration and customs enforcement officers detained the mother - whose birth country was not disclosed - and her kids, one of whom is in third grade, on march 27 while they were executing an arrest on a farm in sackets harbor, new york, according to the new york immigration coalition. kelly rissman reports. elon musk broke his silence after suffering defeat in the wisconsin supreme court race, which cemented a liberal majority for the next three years. susan crawfords win keeps the court under a 4-3 liberal majority in the face of crucial litigation surrounding abortion access, voting rights and redistricting. like president donald trump, musk chose to focus on the background win of wisconsin voters approving the constitutional amendment to enshrine voter id laws, a vote that was being held at the same time as the supreme court race. this was the most important thing, musk posted on x in response to a post on voter id. madeline sherratt has the full story. kelly loeffler, former georgia senator and now head of the small business administration in the trump administration, hailed donald trumps liberation day as the single greatest salvation, for not just small businesses, but for america, during an appearance on fox business this morning. the president eagerly posted a clip of her conversation with maria bartiromo to his truth social account italys prime minister giorgia meloni and the countrys top business lobby warned on wednesday that impending u.s. tariffs could significantly impact the nations exports and its already struggling economy. it is clear that the introduction of new tariffs would have heavy repercussions for italian producers, meloni said while hosting a prize-giving ceremony for italian cuisine in rome. meloni added that she did not rule out adequate responses to protect the exports of the euro zones third largest economy, though she did not provide further details. italy recorded a trade surplus with the united states of 39 billion euros 42.14 billion in 2024, the third largest in the 20-nation euro area, according to eurostat data. earlier on wednesday, the business association confindustria reported that italys economy is expected to grow by 0.6 this year, half of the governments official target and down from a 0.9 forecast made by the group in october. the economy expanded by a modest 0.7 in both 2024 and 2023. it managed to achieve 0.1 growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the previous three months, after stagnating in the third quarter. most analysts do not foresee any significant rebound in the near term. confindustria indicated that while its forecasts accounted for the already-announced u.s. tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as what it termed record levels of uncertainty regarding trade policy, they did not consider the effects of an escalating trade war. in a worst-case scenario, with permanent 25 u.s. tariffs on all imports, rising to 60 for china, coupled with retaliatory measures against u.s. exports, italys growth could decline to around 0.2 this year, it said. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Trump warned US economy to be hit hardest by tariff war: Live updates - The Independent
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 15:31:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Realism, one might interpret the trade policy discussions as reflecting a state-centric view where national economic gain is prioritized, potentially at the expense of global stability. The text notes the 'aggressive tariff plans' and the claim that they 'would produce great benefits for american workers' while simultaneously acknowledging the negative impact on 'nearly all countries' and the risk of 'global recession'. This aligns with a realist perspective where states pursue self-interest in a competitive international system, viewing economic interactions through a zero-sum lens.; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory appears relevant in examining how specific issues gain prominence. The article highlights media reports (NBC News, Bloomberg, BBC) focusing on the Hegseth information leak and the economic consequences of tariffs, alongside official statements (Leavitt on student loans, Vance on tariffs, Bessent on China). This suggests that the selection and emphasis of these topics by both media and officials shape the public agenda, potentially diverting attention from or amplifying certain narratives over others.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents conflicting or potentially erroneous naming conventions for administration officials. Textual Basis: It refers to a 'press secretary karoline hegseth' and later 'white house press secretary karoline leavitt', and mentions 'treasury secretary scott bessent' immediately after discussing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a way that could cause confusion. Significance: Such inconsistencies, if not simple typos, could suggest reporting errors or a lack of clarity in official communication, potentially impacting the perceived reliability of the information presented. Probing Questions: Are these naming variations indicative of reporting inaccuracies, and how might such details influence a reader's trust in the overall narrative? What does the juxtaposition of the Defense Secretary and Treasury Secretary discussions imply about the article's structure or underlying connections the author perceives?

fund, told the bbc on tuesday. the u.s. economy will be one of the hardest hit by the aggressive tariff plans, the imf warned earlier in the day as it slashed forecasts for global economic growth, with the u.s. dropping to just 1.8 percent, from a previous forecast of 2.7 percent. the global economic growth forecast was cut by half a percentage point, with downgrades in nearly all countries amid ongoing uncertainty from the trump administrations trade policy. this came after vice president jd vance admitted that president donald trumps aggressive tariff increases will profoundly change the u.s. economy and other nations. in a speech in india, vance said the rebalancing from aggressive tariffs would produce great benefits for american workers. earlier, gold prices surged to a record high while the value of the u.s dollar plunged, following trumps latest attack on the federal reserve chair jerome powell. press secretary karoline hegseth was asked about embattled defense secretary pete hegseth at todays white house briefing. she told reporters that president donald trump continues to stand behind hegseth. white house press secretary karoline leavitt has announced that the education department will resume involuntary collections for defaulted student loans on may 5th. they will recoup loans and go after tax refunds, federal pensions and even their wages, of those who owe money. if you take out a loan, you have to pay it back very simple, leavitt said. defense secretary pete hegseth pulled the airstrike information he posted into signal chats with his wife, brother and dozens of others from a secure communications channel used by u.s. central command, raising new questions as to whether the embattled pentagon head leaked classified information over an open, unsecured network. nbc news first reported that the launch times and bomb drop times of u.s. warplanes that were about to strike houthi targets in yemen details that multiple officials have said is highly classified were taken from secure u.s. central command communications. a person familiar with the second chat confirmed that to the associated press. press secretary karoline leavitt confirmed president donald trumps upcoming travel plans at todays white house briefing. the president will depart washington, d.c., on friday to travel to rome for the funeral of pope francis on saturday,

their own preferred version of reality to that of adolf hitlers third reich. ariana baio reports from new york. kenneth rogoff, a former chief economist of the international monetary fund, says that if president donald trump doesnt retreat on his tariffs, the chance of a u.s. recession and subsequent global recession is almost 100 percent. rogoff was speaking to bbc radio 4s pm programme in the u.k. today. defense secretary pete hegseth doubled down during a tuesday morning fox and friends interview, insisting that the information on airstrike launches and bomb drop times that he shared with his wife, brother, and dozens of others in two separate signal chats was not classified. hegseth didnt deny the existence of a separate chat instead, he attacked the media and his former staff, whom he accused of leaking information about the chats. his repeat denial comes as nbc news reported tuesday that the information hegseth posted came directly from secure communications from the head of u.s. central command, gen. erik kurilla. the pentagons inspector general is investigating the chats. the material kurilla sent included details about when u.s. fighters would take off and when they would hit their targets details that could, if they fell into the wrong hands, put the pilots of those fighters in grave danger. but he was doing exactly what he was supposed to providing hegseth, his superior, with information he needed to know and using a system specifically designed to safely transmit sensitive and classified information. but then hegseth used his personal phone to send some of the same information kurilla had given him to at least two group text chats on the signal messaging app, three u.s. officials with direct knowledge of the exchanges told nbc news. the sequence of events, which has not previously been reported, could raise new questions about hegseths handling of the information, which he and the government have denied was classified. in all, according to the two sources, less than 10 minutes elapsed between kurillas giving hegseth the information and hegseths sending it to the two group chats, one of which included other cabinet-level officials and their designees and, inadvertently, the editor of the atlantic magazine. one of them was composed of hegseths wife, brother and attorney and some of his aides. treasury secretary scott bessent told a closed-door investor summit tuesday that the tariff standoff with china is unsustainable and that he expects the situation to de-escalate, bloomberg reports. bessent made the remarks at a jpmorgan chase event on the sidelines of the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings in washington, d.c. he added that negotiations between the u.s. and china have not yet started but that a deal is possible, according to people who attended his session, which wasnt open to the public or media. u.s. stocks rose after his comments, with the sp 500 index gaining as much as 2.9 as of 1228

  Title: Trump’s tariffs may be reduced but their impact will be felt in the UK and beyond
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-10 05:00:21)
  Content: donald trump may have stepped back from his huge tariff rises on every country, except china, which now faces at least 145, but the impact of the market chaos is likely to continue in the uk and beyond. the rest of the world still faces a blanket 10 tariff on all us exports. while much of the focus has been the direct impact of the tariffs on physical goods, trumps actions threaten to reach every corner of global finance and the economy. here, we examine the potential consequences of the tariffs and the fallout, from derailing deals and further undermining londons stock exchange, to risking a rise in corruption and pushing up prices for consumers. falling global growth view image in fullscreen workers make garments for export at a workshop in jiangsu province, china. photograph nurphotogetty the leading economic forecasters have yet to give their verdict, but the international monetary fund has already said the trade war will damage trade and business investment in most countries. china could fail to meet its 5 growth target for 2025, while germany could be pushed into recession. the uk is likely to escape relatively unscathed in terms of trade. uk goods exports to the us are significant, but businesses are expected to minimise the impact of tariffs, leading to a modest 0.1 percentage point reduction in uk gdp this year. however, with borrowing costs still high and consumer confidence at risk, the tariffs present a significant headache for keir starmer. soaring inflation and lower rates central banks have spent much of the past three years attempting to reduce inflation, which reached as high as 11 after russias full-scale invasion of ukraine in 2022. trumps tariffs threaten to send costs for consumers surging. it is why the eu and the uk have proved reluctant to respond in kind to washingtons barrage of tariffs. some estimates say us inflation currently at 2.8 could peak at 4.5 next year if tariffs remain in place and that the chances of a us recession have increased. to tackle this, central banks across the uk and europe are widely expected to cut rates soon to protect their economies. the us federal reserve has not signalled that interest rate cuts are on the way in the us, but it may be forced to if growth slows as anticipated. stock market listing delays view image in fullscreen it may take the china-founded, fast-fashion retailer shein longer to charge ahead with plans for a float on the london stock exchange photograph bloomberggetty the city has been waiting patiently for a market rebound that would help unleash pent-up plans for floats by some of the uks biggest fintech firms, including neobanks such as revolut, monzo and starling. the fintech lobby group innovate finance even convened a unicorn council in 2024 that has been loosely referred to as a group of uk companies seen as ipo candidates. the swedish buy now, pay later giant klarnas 15bn new york float was seen as imminent, with the company widely expected to launch an investor roadshow this week. but as a result of the market turmoil it has failed to announce any further progress. there are also questions about how long it may take for the china-founded, fast-fashion retailer shein to charge ahead with plans for a controversial float on the london stock exchange. shein reportedly filed papers with britains markets regulator in early june last year, though a date for its potential float has yet to be set. the valuation of the float has reportedly been cut from the 64bn-plus it had previously hoped for. meanwhile, the italian fashion group prada has reportedly negotiated a discount of more than 200m 156m on the purchase of versace in light of the trade war, the financial times reported. junk bonds the us investment firm blackrock has given junk bonds a clean bill of health, saying the loans made by companies that use them as a lifeline are not threatened by trumps tariffs. a junk bond is a grade of loan that pays a high interest rate because ratings agencies consider them risky. the two largest department stores in the us, saks and neiman, came together at the end of 2024 in a buyout funded by a 2.2bn junk bond paying 11 interest. there are other retailers in the us that almost exist just to finance their loans. however, choppy markets have left investors considering the implications of high tariff rates on deals in new york, freezing debt refinancing arrangements, bloomberg reported. skip past newsletter promotion sign up to business today free daily newsletter get set for the working day well

fighting renationalisation. photograph neil hallepa the uks biggest water supplier, which is struggling under a debt pile of close to 20bn, has selected the us private equity group kkr as a preferred partner as it seeks to secure fresh equity funding for its operations by the end of june, staving off nationalisation. it is understood the money is already in place. however, kkrs investment committee has a veto and the deal could be scuppered if the tariff war triggers further turmoil on financial markets. that said, kkr was part of a consortium that reached a 1.6bn deal to buy the nhs landlord assura on wednesday. banks preparing for bad debts profits at banks across the world could take a hit, with tariffs affecting business borrowers and large corporate clients that sell products to the us. it could dampen appetite for loans and weigh on demand for investment banking services, which help execute mergers and acquisitions, as well as fundraising through financial markets including ipos. but a drop in revenues could make it harder for companies to repay their debts. that could, in turn, force banks to start putting aside money for potential defaults in their first-quarter results, which are due later this month. natwest privatisation delayed the governments stake in natwest group the bank formerly known as royal bank of scotland has been rapidly dwindling, having fallen to 3.95 at the end of march as the government took advantage of the lenders strong share price. it fuelled speculation that the bank could be weeks away from completely ditching its taxpayer-owned shares. however, market ructions caused by the tariff backlash have likely put a temporary pause on the state sell-down, as the government aims to recoup as much of its cash as possible. the uk government originally spent 46bn bailing out rbs at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, leaving taxpayers owning about 84 of the lender. natwest shares have struggled to return to the 500p paid by the government 17 years ago, but managed to hit 480p in early march. increased corruption mary lovely, a trade expert at the peterson institute in washington, has raised the prospect of widespread fraud at us ports and airports as customs officials wrestle with a complicated tariff regime affecting tens of thousands of imported goods. the situation will get worse for border staff if trump scraps the de-minimis rule that allowed goods valued at less than 800 to enter the us tariff free. there could be huge pressure on customs officials from importers to wave through shipments for a fee to escape high tariffs.

  Title: ‘In economic terms, Trump’s tariffs make no sense at all’ - The Guardian
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-04 16:16:23)
  Content: presidents move has no historic parallels, but the deep uncertainty for the global economy may prove as destructive as the tariffs from world leaders, to the tiniest manufacturers thousands of miles from washington, decision-makers across the global economy are racked with uncertainty as they scramble to come to terms with donald trumps historic tariffs. experts are all but unanimous that the impact on global growth of wednesdays extraordinary rose garden press conference will be negative but just how bad remains highly uncertain. in economic terms, it makes no sense at all, said jordi gual, the former chair of caixabank, spains largest domestic lender, who is now an economics professor at iese business school in barcelona. it is hugely problematic, because we go back to a level we hadnt seen since the 1930s. trumps announcement that he would impose tariffs of 10 to almost 50 on the uss largest trading partners including a 34 additional border tax on chinese imports and a 10 levy on the uk was designed to encourage multinational companies to relocate their factories, jobs and supply chains to the us. the president promised it would usher in a new golden age, but financial markets responded with a jarring two-day sell-off, underlining the potential risks of such an unprecedented policy, which is expected to increase prices in the us, and weaken growth worldwide. the aggregate effects will depend on several factors, including how successful governments are in negotiating carve-outs from the tariffs and how the us currency responds. typically, economists would predict that the dollar would strengthen as a result of the tariff spree, cushioning the impact on us consumers in terms of higher prices but the greenback has weakened on foreign exchange markets since trumps announcement. that could exacerbate the situation by unleashing even more inflation than is already likely from higher import taxes, and complicating the task of the federal reserve in battling any slowdown in growth. the us central bank may be reluctant to cut rates in the face of rocketing prices. the ability of monetary policy to be the shock absorber may be more limited now because of the price impact of tariffs, and the stickiness of inflation, said gerard lyons, the chief economist strategist at netwealth. the scope for spending policy to offset any potential slowdown with tax cuts to boost demand, for example also looks constrained inside and outside the us, with many countries already struggling with the debt hangover from covid. another important factor driving the scale of the hit to growth is how aggressively us economic rivals hit back, with tit-for-tat tariffs likely to make a bad situation worse. part of the answer emerged on friday, when beijing announced that instead of a forensically targeted response, it would simply slap 34 tariffs on all us imports. markets plunged. researchers at the oxford economics consultancy predicted trumps measures could knock global gdp growth to below 2 this year, the weakest rate since the 2008 financial crisis, excluding the pandemic. after global growth of 3.2 in 2024, such an outcome would mark a significant decline, but would fall short of a global recession which economists view as gdp growth falling short of the 0.9 rate of world population growth. suggestions that the entire global trading system will be brought to a halt look wide of the mark, however. although the us has lengthy supply chains stretching into vital overseas markets, trade still stands as a relatively small proportion of its overall 30tn economy and as much as 80 of global trade in goods does not directly touch the us, according to research from the boston consulting group. although were focused on the us being the largest economy, and the largest importer, things have changed from 10, 20, 30 years ago, said butler. if you compare this with going back to the early 1970s, when nixon took the dollar off the gold standard and imposed a temporary 10 tariff on trade, the us was vastly more important then. the impact on countries will vary significantly, depending on the level of tariffs they face, and how reliant they are on exports to the us, and on trade more broadly. sign up to business today get set for the working day well point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion analysts at the capital economics consultancy reckon eu growth may be 0.25 lower as a result of the 20 levy its exports face, and chinese growth perhaps 0.75 lower, for example. they suggest the uk, which was not in trumps sights because it does not have a major trade surplus with the us and so faces the minimum 10 tariff, will not be among the worst hit. in the uk, the effect on growth is still a rounding error its 0.1, said capitals chief economist, neil shearing. it hits exporters in particular sectors but it doesnt necessarily hit the uk economy as a whole. for some economies in the global south facing eye-wateringly high tariffs, however, and with little negotiating power, the effects could be devastating. cambodia faces 49 tariffs, laos 48 and vietnam 46. back on trumps doorstep, in the medium term, experts say a radically more protectionist us is likely to be less competitive and more expensive and may encourage other economies to forge deeper trading links between each other. you have a doughnut, where the us is an island surrounded by tariffs of 10-60, while the rest of the world goes its own way, says creon butler, who leads the global economy and finance programme at chatham house, in london. look at how the soviet union performed in a state of autarky economic isolationism. if you do have this us island economy, you will have poorer quality, more expensive products, and international supply chains going elsewhere. economists fret that in the immediate future uncertainty itself is having a dampening effect which could end up as damaging as the tariff policy itself. gual said some people argue hes playing the madman strategy. or some sort of random behaviour so that rivals, enemies, cannot anticipate his next move. maybe that in geopolitics has some role. but in economics that increases the level of uncertainty and it is not supportive of economic growth and financial stability. how many thousands of individual businesses and consumers respond in the coming days and weeks, will be critical in determining the impact of liberation day. do multinationals rapidly reshape their supply chains or hold back from investment while they wait to see if trump changes his mind? and does the us consumer keep on spending, or balk against rising prices? as shearing said the issue is that not only is it, where does the tariff policy land, but the range of different outcomes is extremely wide. as economists, we dont have the tools to deal with the human side of economics and there really are no historical parallels.

  Title: Stock market rallies after closed-door remarks by Treasury Secretary Bessent - Fortune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 20:15:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The recurring mentions of 'Trump tariffs' and 'Trump policy changes' alongside discussions of corporate hits (RTX), market reactions ('volatility spike', 'markets open sharply higher'), and geopolitical shifts ('softens on china', 'china de-escalation') align with aspects of Political Economy theory. This perspective suggests that political decisions and the actions of key political figures (like Trump) are not merely isolated events but have direct, measurable consequences on economic actors (companies like RTX, markets) and international economic relations (China trade). The text provides evidence of this linkage by explicitly connecting policy actions (tariffs, changes) to economic outcomes (hits, market shifts).; Theories_and_interpretations: The juxtaposition of headlines about market reactions to political statements ('investors are finally taking trump seriously', 'markets open sharply higher after trump softens') and the mention of 'agenda-setting' in the context of financial news (implied by the focus on specific topics like tariffs, Fed Chair, China) could be viewed through the lens of Agenda-Setting Theory. While typically applied to media influence on public perception, here it highlights how the *focus* of political figures (Trump's statements on China, Powell) can directly influence the *agenda* of financial markets and news coverage, demonstrating the power of political rhetoric to shape economic attention and action, as evidenced by the immediate market response described.; Intriguing_angles: The text mentions 'doges staffing cuts' as a cause for the IRS's 'nightmare' tax season and potential refund delays. The term 'doges' is unusual in this context and lacks clear identification as a standard entity type (Organization, Government Agency). Its significance lies in being presented as a direct causal factor for a major government agency's operational failure, yet its nature remains undefined within the article. What entity or concept does 'doges' represent in this context, and why is it presented as a singular, impactful cause without further clarification?

steady, as expected. then, the fed lowered median projections for gdp and lifted those for inflation. still, powell said after the meeting that policymakers base case was that a tariff-induced inflation bump would be transitory. on friday, trump urged the fed to cut interest rates, one day after he said he welcomed the slide in 10-year yields. treasury secretary scott bessent has said repeatedly that lower treasury yields are a priority for the administration. trump will tell them to feel the market and eventually they will cut not in may, though, said neil dutta, head of us economic research at renaissance macro research. powell is focused on inflation expectations even as financial conditions have tightened. thats hawkish, all else equal. the ongoing reaction across markets has been stark. the sp 500 saw its worst two-day plunge since march 2020 in a rout that has shed about 5 trillion in value, with the gauge down 6 on friday. the nasdaq 100 entered a bear market. markets have priced in a roughly 50 probability of a quarter-point rate reduction at the next fed meeting in may. some traders are even betting on an emergency rate cut before the may 6-7 meeting, with open interest in the april fed funds futures soaring. many of the moves persisted even after march employment data released friday showed that 228,000 nonfarm jobs were created, exceeding the 140,000 median forecast of economists in a bloomberg survey. january and february job gains were revised lower, though, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2. what bloomberg strategists say. a lot of this bond market rally will have to be reversed in the next couple of months. and with no relief from discount rates implied by treasury yields, equities will suffer even more as a consequence. this is stagflation with inflation as the binding constraint. edward harrison, the everything risk newsletter, washington the bond market is seeming to keep its focus on the tariff news, said zachary griffiths, head of investment-grade and macroeconomic strategy at creditsights. european bonds have been swept up in the bond rally, anticipating a hit to growth from the 20 us tariff. germanys 10-year yield, the regional benchmark, has plunged this week, erasing the surge unleashed by the nations increased spending plans in march. traders also expect the european central bank to lower rates more sharply, with three quarter-point reductions fully priced in for this year and a chance of a fourth. the bank of england also is seen easing 74 basis points. the global bond surge even saw sub-zero rates return in some corners. the bid yield on two-year swiss government bonds turned negative for the first time since 2022. the swiss national bank cut its key policy rate to 0.25 from 1.75 last year, and traders are betting on at least another quarter-point cut by the end of 2025, with some hedging for further easing. bloomberg economics estimates us tariffs could reduce us demand for swiss goods goods by around 60. for mark dowding, chief investment officer at rbc bluebay asset management, the repricing has already gone far enough. he doubts that both the fed and ecb will be able to respond to tariffs with monetary easing, citing inflationary concerns in the us and an emphasis on fiscal support in europe, and is instead looking for entry points to bet against bonds once markets settle. the rally in bond yields appears overdone, he wrote in a note. we think the fed will do nothing for the foreseeable future, as long as there is not a large rise in unemployment. treasuries have already rallied 3.8 this year, according to a bloomberg gauge of us debt. in the us, fed officials have said that a resilient labor market and sticky inflation mean they can afford to stand pat, even as trumps tariffs sapped consumer and business confidence. this jobs report is going to create an absolute mess for the fed response to economic risks, said guy lebas, chief fixed income strategist for janney montgomery scott. the best case for risk assets is that the data deteriorate quickly enough to generate a fed response. the bad case for risk assets is that jobs muddle through in the face of warmer short-term inflation prints. economists generally expect that tariffs will lift inflation and slow growth, keeping the fed in wait-and-see mode. but the tariffs unveiled wednesday were larger than anticipated, clouding the picture. while morgan stanley now expects no cuts this year, down from one previously, citing inflation risks, ubs global wealth management see more easing this year. vineer bhansali, chief investment officer and founder of longtail alpha, said hes buying two-year notes and selling 30-year bonds, a trade known as a curve steepener. its a bet that a slowing economy will force the fed to lower interest rates, while elevated inflation would lead long-term bonds to underperform. that growing wager is reflected in the market, with the yield difference between two-year and 30-year bonds widening. the distribution of possible outcomes has gotten flatter, bhansali said. anything can happen. now that the us has

  Title: What are tariffs, how do they work and why is Trump using them? - BBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-04 10:46:51)
  Content: us president donald trump has announced sweeping new tariffs on goods imported from the rest of the world. trump claims that a 10 tariff on all nations and much higher rates of up to 50 on individual countries will boost the us economy and protect jobs. however, there are warnings that prices will rise for us consumers and that the move could harm the world economy. tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries. typically, they are a percentage of a products value. for example, a 25 tariff on a 10 7.59 product would mean an additional 2.50 1.90 charge. companies that bring the foreign goods into the country have to pay the tax to the government. firms can choose to pass on some or all of the cost to customers, or may decide to import fewer foreign goods. trump says tariff is his favourite word and for decades he has argued that the us should use them to boost its economy. he says tariffs will encourage us consumers to buy more american-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and lead to huge levels of investment in the country. trump wants to reduce the gap between the value of goods the us buys from other countries and the value of those it sells to them. he argues that america has been taken advantage of by cheaters and pillaged by foreigners. trump has also made other demands alongside tariffs. the first announced during his current presidential term targeted key us trading partners china, mexico and canada. he said he wanted them to do more to stop migrants and drugs reaching the us. trump said a minimum 10 tariff would apply to all imports to the us from 5 april. the uk, argentina, australia, brazil and saudi arabia are among the countries this applies to. however, many nations will face much higher tariffs, starting on 9 april. these tariffs include 49 on cambodian products, 46 on vietnamese imports and an extra 34 on those from china in addition to 20 tariffs previously announced. goods from the eu will be taxed at 20. white house officials described the higher tariffs - on countries trump called the worst offenders - as reciprocal. reciprocal would mean they were based on what countries already charge the us in the form of existing tariffs, plus non-tariff barriers such as regulations. however, this is not what has happened for all of the countries on the list. instead the tariff rate was calculated on the basis that it would eliminate the uss goods trade deficit with each country. the 2 april tariffs are not the first which trump has announced. he had previously introduced a 10 tariff on chinese goods, which was later doubled to 20. he also announced 25 tariffs on goods from mexico and canada, and a 10 tariff on canadian energy imports, before announcing some exemptions and delays. he has also introduced a 25 tariff on all steel and aluminium imports, and a 25 tariff on all foreign-made cars - with a 25 tariff on car parts due to come in at a later date. many economists expect tariffs to push up prices across a range of imported goods, as firms pass on some or all of their increased costs. the products affected could include everything from beer, whisky and tequila to maple syrup, fuel and avocados. some firms may also decide to import fewer foreign goods - or stop altogether - which could in turn make those which are available more expensive. the price of goods manufactured in the us using imported components may also rise. for example, car parts typically cross the us, mexican and canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled. car prices had already been expected to increase as a result of earlier tariffs. the cost of a car made using parts from mexico and canada alone could rise by 4,000-10,000 3,035 - 7,588 depending on the vehicle, according to analysts at the anderson economic group. the chance of a recession rose to 50 after trumps announcement on new tariffs, according to former international monetary fund chief economist ken rogoff. trump previously refused to rule out the possibility of a recession as a result of his trade policies. us commerce secretary howard lutnick said tariffs were worth it even if they led to an economic downturn. the uk exported around 58bn of goods to the us in 2024, mainly machinery, cars and pharmaceuticals. it was already due to be affected by the earlier tariffs targeting steel, aluminium and car imports. prime minister sir keir starmer said clearly there will be an economic impact from the new 10 tariff. however, he said us-uk trade talks are ongoing, and that he will fight for the best deal for britain. the uk government has so far not announced any taxes on us imports. however, it is drawing up a list of us products it could hit with retaliatory tariffs. economists have warned us tariffs could knock the uks economy off course and make it harder for the government to hit its borrowing rules. eu chief ursula von der leyen warned that the consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe. she said europe was finalising its response package to the steel and aluminium tariffs which had already been announced. china, which is facing tariffs totalling 54, said it will place an additional 34 tariff on us goods from 10 april. canadas prime minister mark carney said it was essential to act with purpose and with force. italys giorgia meloni - a trump ally - said the announcement was wrong but that she would work towards a deal with the us to prevent a trade war. in the republic of ireland, micheál martin said there was no justification for deeply regrettable tariffs which benefitted no-one. australias anthony albanese said this is not the act of a friend. south koreas acting president han duck-soo said the global trade war has become a reality. japan said its 24 levy was extremely regrettable and could violate world trade organization and us-japan agreements. the shuttle with four space tourists aboard was also the first to splash down in the pacific ocean in 50 years. kilmar abergo garcia, who had protected legal status in the us, was deported last month to an el salvadorian prison. the us president, who has vowed to remake the global trade order, dismissed concerns, noting the us jobs market is strong. workers are right to fear for their pensions, but the greater worry is the here and now - the economy they live in. the president has granted the app a second 75-day extension to comply with a law that requires it to either sell its us assets or face a ban. 2025 bbc. . the bbc is not responsible for the content of external sites. read about our approach to external linking.

  Title: Americans braced for era of uncertainty as Trump doubles down on tariffs
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-06 12:00:50)
  Content: since donald trump returned to the white house, americans have grown used to high drama and rapid-fire headlines, as executive orders from the oval office have reshaped the us, from stripping back lgbtq rights to gutting environmental regulations amid a sense that the us is slipping into authoritarianism. but even against that backdrop, last week stood out, as trump launched a fierce global trade war, imposed tariffs on its trading partners and triggered a global market meltdown, including on trumps own cherished wall street, where hundreds of billions of dollars of stock values evaporated. now, with all eyes nervously on mondays markets amid fears that the calamitous drops will continue, recession fears are mounting in america. jp morgan analysts last week boosted their odds on a global recession to 60 and americans are bracing for a return of inflation the thing that above all else likely doomed trumps predecessor, joe biden. but trump remained unmoved by market drops and the global political condemnation and even rare criticism from his own republican party saying now is a great time to get rich and that china played it wrong they panicked. on the streets of new york too, there was panic among some. in washington square park, two sisters from detroit were sitting on a park bench nearby the magnolia trees now in bloom. kathleen, a primary school teacher, said she worried about whether there was a plan in place before changes are made. i want to be optimistic, but i live under an umbrella of worry with this administration, kathleen said. i worry about the leadership, worry about a lack of continuity within the leadership, and so many changes at once without a plan. her sister, elizabeth, said shed grown so anxious shed stepped back from the news. our mum definitely had a huge jump in anxiety over this past week over her investments. she worked hard for those and she lives on them a retired schoolteacher, and the drop in stocks very much impacts her day-to-day feeling of security. but leo ezekiel, 39, had a different perspective. as a financier, he wasnt so worried about the stock markets. its mostly that big corporations are deciding to sell off, and that will affect people, but in the long run, if stocks go down, it gives room for them to move up. its part of the game and its always been like that in the united states. trump made his move because he dreams of a return of american manufacturing might, convinced that tariffs will force factories home to the us, even though almost all economists think that is highly unlikely. yet, for such a momentous decision which has rattled the entire world economy, trump reportedly only made up his mind at the last minute. according to the washington post, trump didnt arrive on an exact plan until just three hours before the rose garden announcement. the liberation day announcement from the white house was a choreographed event, and his speech drew cheers from audience, largely made up cabinet members and blue-collar workers from manufacturing sectors that have for decades been economically pummeled by foreign competition. he offered up a vision that tariffs would bring back an older american economy, reopening factories and returning prosperity to ordinary workers. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump complained. but it is not going to happen any more. vice-president jd vance said weve seen closing factories, weve seen rising inflation. weve seen the cost of housing so high that most americans cant afford to buy a home right now, vance said. president trump is taking this economy in a different direction. americas largest trading partners, mexico, canada, china, germany and japan, were less enthusiastic, to say the least. china has announced retaliatory duties of 34 the canadian prime minister mark carney announced a limited set of counter-measures and called the us moves a tragedy for 80 years of free and open exchange of goods and services, led by the us. the british pm keir starmer said nothing would be off the table when it came to the uks response to the tariffs the uk imports 76.2bn in us services but that just as with defence and security the world was entering a new era in economy and trade. it is one where answers to even the most basic questions remain unknown. will trumps tariffs on us trade partners go down as an act of economic self-sabotage? or are tariffs merely a negotiating ploy to influence other nations war by other means? or is trump finally getting to express his long-held economic view that the us has been making bad deals for decades?

doesnt give a fuck. hes going to do what hes going to do. hes going to do what he promised to do on the campaign trail. but even some former trump economic officials privately expressed doubts that returning the us to an era of manufacturing self-sufficiency was likely impossible. the author michael wolff, who has published four books about trump in power, says the us president will now be keenly gauging how his interruption into global trade norms is going down, with updates and live-action replays provided by aides. trump, wolff says, is likely caught between two opposing instincts. its great for him hes dominating the news once again. nobody is talking about anything else except tariffs. suddenly, tariffs, an arcane piece of trade policy, are the most dramatic thing in the world that hes imbued with reality-show stuff. hell be really pleased with that. but on the other hand, wolff predicts, trump will be watching the financial markets. hell have the business guys calling up saying what the fuck are you doing? im sure he hasnt come to any conclusion. so on the one hand its great hes the worlds leading guy again. on the other, it might collapse in on him. and that, he adds, is the essence of trump. hes fundamentally self-destructive, but that self-destructive impulse is exactly what keeps him at the forefront of the news.

  Title: Bank of England rate-setter says US tariffs likely to push down on inflation
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 11:13:59)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article touches upon aspects of Realism in international relations, specifically concerning trade and tariffs. The US imposing tariffs on the UK, as mentioned in the text ('the us has imposed a 10 import tariff on goods coming from the uk, a policy which also applies to many other countries'), exemplifies a state acting in its perceived self-interest to protect its economy, regardless of the impact on other nations. This action, and the UK's subsequent economic considerations, reflect the competitive and often conflictual nature of international trade relations as described by Realist theory.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents Megan Greene's analysis of potential disinflationary effects of US tariffs on the UK, but also acknowledges 'a tonne of uncertainty around this.' This uncertainty, coupled with the mention of 'both inflationary and disinflationary forces,' suggests a more complex and potentially volatile economic situation than a simple cause-and-effect narrative. What specific factors contribute most to this uncertainty, and how might they interact to produce unexpected economic outcomes?; Intriguing_angles: The opening section discusses the importance of 'parsing out the facts from the messaging' in the context of US politics, while the latter part focuses on economic analysis of UK inflation. This juxtaposition, while seemingly unrelated, could subtly imply that economic narratives are also subject to manipulation or biased framing. To what extent might political messaging influence the interpretation and presentation of economic data, and what mechanisms might facilitate such influence?

yeah, well, listen, that thats very good spinach what they serve. but you know, paul, to your point, you know, typically geopolitics sits well in the back seat of the car, if you will, and every once in a while, the driver, which is either interest rates or or corporate profits, who tends to sit shotgun, looks back and says, hey, pipe down. thats just not the case right now. we have this unfortunate series of events where we we obviously have the immediacy of tariffs, but we dont have the clarity on when well actually see tax reform, nor, as i mentioned earlier, when will we actually see more of an active dialogue across global officials. and so the initial salvo with respect to responses from macron, with responses to what we heard from china was, were not necessarily going to come immediately to the negotiation table. so what i think that means is theres probably some more spinach, if you will, being handed out by the by the passenger in the back seat to mix metaphors. but more importantly, what i think this challenges investors like us to think about is just, okay, where does that fundamental case ultimately kick in? what will consumers do? and wed already seen before the tariff announcements some bifurcation between higher income, middle income, and lower income consumers. and if anything, the risk is that gap widens and it widens more quickly. so some of the market reaction we think is that that time gap between moving from the the spinach course to the dessert course, but it also, i think, begs the question of when will we see a deterioration in consumer activity. were not going to learn a lot from the jobs data tomorrow. we will learn from what chair powell has to say with more of his forward views. but ill also just say this, this is actually not very well covered, but we had vice chair jefferson present today in atlanta. and again, very intelligent economist. he mentioned in the course of a 3,000 word presentation, this is the parsing that we do, he used the word tariff once in that entire presentation. so what i think that says is there may be a little bit of a of a hold off of a firm communication from the fed if were to use vice chair jeffersons guidance today. therell be a lot of focus on what we hear from chair powell tomorrow. reuters -institutional shareholder services has recommended pfizer investors reject a proposal on executive compensation at its upcoming annual meeting, citing concerns about certain changes made to long-term awards to its ceo and others. the modifications, including repeated changes to pfizers cash flow targets, and a lack of clarity about certain pipeline goals are concerning and undermine a pay-for-performance philosophy, iss said. annual incentives for executives are tied to achieving three financial goals, and payouts can be 30 percentage points higher or lower based on pipeline and esg-related goals achieved, iss said. cybersecurity stocks have not been immune from the recent market sell-off, opening up some attractive entry points for some of the top companies in the space. lets look at three cybersecurity stocks you might want to buy now and hold for the long term. while known for its next-generation firewalls, palo alto networks nasdaq panw has transformed itself into more of a complete cybersecurity company. buying high-quality dividend stocks is a great way to collect passive dividend income. the best ones increase their dividends each year, and they can help you more than offset the impact of inflation over the long run. federal realty investment trust nyse frt, nnn reit nyse nnn, and essex property trust nyse ess have elite records of growing their dividends. microsoft, alphabet, nvidia and amazon are part of the zacks top analyst blog. here are buffetts words on investing through a crisis. can you retire at 65 with 750,000 in a roth ira and 1,800 in monthly social security?

  Title: US Stocks Push Higher After Bessent’s Remarks: Markets Wrap - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 16:13:42)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article's emphasis on market reactions immediately following reports of potential policy shifts ('SP 500 rose... after bloomberg news reported closed-door comments') suggests that the *reporting* of information, even from private sources, is framed as a primary driver of financial sentiment. This highlights how media focus can influence what investors perceive as the most critical factors (trade tensions, Fed policy), potentially shaping market behavior based on perceived importance rather than solely on concrete economic fundamentals.; Theories_and_interpretations: The description of President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve ('berated powell for being slow to cut interest rates', 'concerns that trump may be preparing to fire powell') and the subsequent market 'reappraisal' of havens ('Trumps policies and his broadsides against the Fed have forced a reappraisal of the dollar and treasuries') aligns with aspects of Political Business Cycle theory. This perspective suggests that political actors may seek to influence monetary policy for short-term gains, and the market's reaction indicates a recognition of potential political interference impacting institutional independence and financial stability perceptions.

  Title: Global growth forecasts slashed in fallout from tariffs, IMF warns
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 14:39:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Economic Protectionism theory, the article details how the US imposition of tariffs ('us president donald trump unveiled a range of new and higher tariffs') is presented as a direct cause ('leading to global trade disruption', 'forced to change its projections') for predicted negative economic outcomes globally ('significantly slow growth', 'slashing its global growth forecast', 'sharp increase... will lead to a significant slowdown'). This aligns with protectionism's predicted consequences of disrupting trade flows and potentially harming overall global economic efficiency, as highlighted by the IMF's warnings.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article's structure, beginning with the IMF's report and its specific findings on growth forecasts and tariff impacts, suggests an application of Agenda-Setting Theory. The IMF, as a prominent international organization ('the international monetary fund imf has warned'), is positioned as the authoritative source defining the key economic problems (slowed growth, uncertainty, trade war risk) and their primary cause (US tariffs), thereby shaping the public discourse and political reactions presented later in the text.

global trade disruption and unprecedented uncertainty is set to significantly slow growth in economies around the world, the international monetary fund imf has warned. the organisation said it is slashing its global growth forecast by 0.5 percentage points this year, with nearly all countries seeing a downgrade. the latest world economic outlook report was produced under exceptional circumstances, with the imf being forced to change its projections after us president donald trump unveiled a range of new and higher tariffs earlier this month. the imfs top economist, pierre-olivier gourinchas, said we are entering a new era as the global system that has operated for the last 80 years is being reset. he added while many of the scheduled tariff increases are on hold for now, the combination of measures and countermeasures has hiked us and global tariff rates to centennial highs. for this reason, we expect that the sharp increase on april 2 in both tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a significant slowdown in global growth in the near term. global growth is projected to fall from 3.3 in 2024 to 2.8 in 2025, before edging up to 3 in 2026. this is lower than the imfs previous forecasts, published in january, by 0.5 percentage points for 2025 and 0.3 percentage points for 2026. the outlook for nearly all countries has been downgraded, reflecting the direct effect of new trade measures and the knock-on impact on uncertainty, which has surged to unprecedented levels, and deteriorating sentiment among consumers and businesses. the uk economy is predicted to grow by 1.1 this year, 0.5 percentage points less than januarys forecast, partly reflecting tariffs, as well as weaker consumption amid higher inflation driven by bills and energy price hikes. growth will nonetheless be stronger in the uk than germany which is predicted to flatline this year france, and italy. meanwhile, inflation forecasts have been revised upwards for advanced economies since january, with the uk and the us being hit hardest. uk inflation is set to be 0.7 percentage points higher this year, compared with the previous forecast, at 3.1 largely due to prices like water and electricity rising from april. this is higher than all other countries in the group of seven advanced economies g7, which incorporates germany, france, italy, japan, canada, and the us. chancellor rachel reeves said the new forecasts show the uk is still the fastest-growing european country in the g7. the imf have recognised that this government is delivering reform which will drive up long-term growth in the uk, through our plan for change, she said. the report also clearly shows that the world has changed, which is why i will be in washington this week defending british interests and making the case for free and fair trade. shadow chancellor mel stride said at a time when families are looking for stability and support, labours policies are stifling growth, pushing up the cost of living and leaving us vulnerable to external shocks. global trade growth projections have been slashed by 1.5 percentage points since the previous world economic outlook. the imf warned over the increased risk of a trade war, which would particularly hit china and the us but also many countries in asia and europe. the organisation stopped short of forecasting a recession in the us, but slashed its growth forecast for the worlds biggest economy to 1.8, down by 0.9 percentage points since its last prediction. it added that the risk of a recession in the us had increased sharply from about a 25 probability to around 40. china is predicted to grow by 4 this year, down from the imfs previous forecast of 4.6. the imf also stressed that central bank independence was important in the fight against rising inflation amid concerns over mr trumps renewed attack on us federal reserve chairman jerome powell, branding him a major loser for not cutting rates. mr gourinchas said at an imf press briefing the critical thing is to make sure that inflation expectations remain anchored and that central banks do whats necessary to bring inflation back to targets. central banks need to remain credible and part of that is built upon their central bank independence. from that perspective, its very important to preserve that. the imf report also showed that heightened uncertainty around trade policy has also weakened the overall outlook, with many global firms likely to react to tariffs by suspending or reducing investments and cutting spending. banks may also slow lending to businesses while they assess how exposed borrowers will be to the new trade environment. the global economy is being severely tested with the risk that trade retaliation may ratchet up tensions, while financial markets could continue to react sharply to lower growth prospects, according to the imf. however, the imf said there is also the opportunity for more positive consequences depending on how countries work together and address the new challenges. if countries de-escalate from their current tariff stance, and co-ordinate to deliver clarity and stability on trade policy, the outlook could immediately brighten, mr gourinchas said.

  Title: Team Trump defends tariffs as bipartisan opposition grows, markets slide
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-06 18:36:37)
  Content: trump administration officials blitzed television networks sunday to defend the presidents massive tariffs that have caused a sell-off in the stock market and triggered recession fears, arguing that the import taxes are already forcing dozens of countries to come to the bargaining table. fifty countries were burning the phone lines into the white house to negotiate with president donald trump, agriculture secretary brooke rollins told cnns state of the union. dont panic, white house senior counselor peter navarro said on fox newss sunday morning futures. and treasury secretary scott bessent, speaking on nbcs meet the press, dismissed predictions from economists and banks that there would be a recession. the full-court press from cabinet members and advisers came as the administration is under immense pressure to pull back on the tariffs, which have caused the biggest loss in american stock market wealth since the panicked sell-off as covid-19 spread in march 2020. a growing number of conservatives are pushing back against trumps moves, with a nonprofit backed by right-wing megadonor charles koch leading a lawsuit against the tariffs, while some republicans in both chambers of congress are organizing a legislative effort to roll them back. and though administration officials remain in lockstep in their support of trump, some of the presidents most vocal supporters are beginning to question the moves. speaking via video call to a conference of italian right-wing politicians on saturday, billionaire trump funder elon musk said he hopes europe and the united states will eliminate all tariffs between them. hedge-fund investor bill ackman, a regular defender of trump, said on x on saturday that he thinks the president will delay the tariffs on monday as trump works through negotiations with countries that are willing to lower their own trade barriers. the risk of not doing so is that the massive increase in uncertainty drives the economy into a recession, potentially a severe one, ackman wrote. ben shapiro, the right-wing pundit and co-founder of the daily wire, called the tariffs probably unconstitutional and illogical, and the wall street journals editorial board, as well as guests on fox news, have criticized the tariffs. meanwhile, liberal politicians are lambasting the president, as did tens of thousands of protesters who took to the streets of washington and cities around the country on saturday in what appeared to be the biggest demonstrations against trump since he took office in january. trump hanging tough still, trump is holding the course. on saturday, he implored followers on his social media platform truth social to hang tough. this is an economic revolution, and we will win, he said. trump administration officials offered two main justifications for the tariffs, saying they are meant to accomplish the long-term goal of completely reforming the american economy while giving the u.s. increased negotiating power to strike new trade deals. this is the ultimate dealmaker who is a businessman at the head of our government, rollins said. at the same time, the agriculture secretary framed the tariffs as part of a long-overdue new american order to protect u.s. industries. though she insisted the dip was a product of the markets adjusting, rollins acknowledged short-term uncertainty for american farmers, noting that the white house is ready to deploy financial aid to them if needed. some of the countries criticized by trump for putting tariffs on american imports, such as india, do so to keep prices stable for their own farmers. financial analysts from global banks, including barclays, bank of america, deutsche bank and the royal bank of canada, have all said the u.s. stands a higher chance of entering into a recession if the tariffs are not pulled back. j.p. morgan economists and analysts see a 60 percent chance of a recession happening this year. but bessent said sunday that the economy remains strong. there doesnt have to be a recession, bessent said, calling the 6 trillion stock-market drop a short-term reaction and comparing the current moment to the early days of ronald reagans presidency. he also rejected warnings from economists and skeptical fellow republicans, arguing that the tariffs are a one-time price adjustment and not a source of lasting inflation. bessent declined to say whether the tariffs are permanent but said they have given trump maximum leverage to renegotiate trade terms. the market consistently underestimates donald trump, he added. were going to hold the course. navarro, for his part, told americans to hold on to their stock portfolios despite cratering share prices. right now the smart strategy is not to panic, just stay in, because we are going to have the biggest boom in the stock market we have ever seen under the trump policies, he said sunday. we will find a bottom in this market quickly. we will hit 50,000 on the dow easily by the end of this term. the dow jones industrial average, a basket of stocks representing 30 big, well-known companies, hit an all-time high of just over 45,000 in december. it was at around 38,000 when the market closed friday which came on the heels of the worst quarter for stocks since spring 2022. meanwhile, gop opposition to the tariffs is growing. rep. don bacon r-nebraska said sunday on cbss face the nation that on monday he will unveil some of the support for his house bill, a companion to a senate bill that aims to bring back control of tariffs to congress. the move is notable because the house has already passed a procedural vote to prevent the chamber from voting on any proposed bill ending trumps emergency declaration on tariffs against mexico, canada and china. it will be harder to pass this in the house, no doubt, bacon conceded. i think if we get 60 votes in the senate itll put pressure on the house to look at this, and if we continue to see the stock market go in a certain direction or if we see inflation or unemployment shift in a bad way, i think this bill becomes very viable. people voted for trump because of inflation, immigration and crime, he noted, adding, i dont think tariffs was really a big factor in peoples decision-making in electing him last november. while trumps cabinet members claimed that dozens of countries are trying to reach the president to negotiate, democrats seized on the fact that trump had spent some of the weekend playing golf. that may end up being the most enduring image of the trump presidency, sen. adam schiff d-california said on nbcs meet the press. the president out on a golf cart while peoples retirement is in flames. while theres growing bipartisan support in congress to rein in trumps tariff authority, the moment demands immediate action, schiff added.

  Content: the cost of borrowing has fallen across the 20-member euro area for the third time this year after the european central bank cut its main interest rate to 2.25 in response to slowing growth and donald trumps tariffs. the frankfurt-based bank cut its benchmark deposit rate by a quarter of a percentage point on thursday, in line with economist expectations, to tackle a slowdown in the bloc and the impact from the border taxes imposed earlier this month on all eu imports into the us. the ecb president, christine lagarde, said us tariffs on eu goods, which had increased from an average of 3 to 13, were already harming the outlook for the european economy. the major escalation in global trade tensions and the associated uncertainty will likely lower euro area growth by dampening exports, she said, adding that they may drag down investment and consumption. lagarde, who has overseen seven cuts, from a high of 4 last year, said it was unclear where interest rates would settle a level known as the neutral rate while uncertainty continued to dominate policymaking. she told told journalists that the concept of neutral rate only worked in a shock-free world, adding anybody in this room who thinks that we are in a shock-free world, i would suggest they have their head examined. in a statement after announcing the cut, the ecbs governing council said the outlook for growth had deteriorated owing to rising trade tensions. increased uncertainty is likely to reduce confidence among households and firms, and the adverse and volatile market response may further weigh on the economic outlook for the euro area, it said. in the meantime, all the main indicators of inflation were falling, allowing for a reduction in interest rates. the central bank said services inflation, which has proved stubbornly high in recent years, had eased markedly over recent months while wage growth was moderating, and where it remained high, companies were absorbing the extra costs in reduced profits. trump has imposed an extra 10 tariff on eu goods to the us, with the threat of a further 10 suspended until july. industry-specific tariffs of 25 already apply on steel, aluminium and cars into the us, and more are threatened on pharmaceuticals and electronics imports. mark wall, the chief european economist at deutsche bank, said the emphasis on a shock from the tariffs implied an openness to further monetary easing, assuming the trade shock persisted, and was borne out in the data. most city economists expect a further rate cut in june. wall said the reductions would continue this year until they reached 1.5, such was the probable hit to european economic growth from us tariffs. financial markets expect central banks in all major economies to cut interest rates this year as tariffs hit global trade and slow growth. investors expect the bank of england to cut the cost of borrowing by a quarter point when policymakers next meet in may and twice more in 2025. before the ecb decision, trump contrasted lagardes record with that of the us federal reserve, which kept rates on hold at its last meeting in march. trump said in a post on his truth social platform that the fed chair, jerome powell, was always too late and wrong and that his termination cannot come fast enough. skip past newsletter promotion sign up to business today free daily newsletter get set for the

reduce hiring. speaking at the economic club of chicago, he said it was unclear what the overall impact would be on the economy and whether the bank would need to raise interest rates to tame inflation or cut rates to increase growth, sparking a large share sell-off on us markets. the international monetary fund imf has said it expects much slower global growth but not a global recession because of the trade tensions. kristalina georgieva, the imfs managing director, said that the latest world economic outlook forecasts will include notable markdowns, but not recession. in a speech before the organisations spring meetings next week in washington, she said economic resilience is being tested again by the reboot of the global trading system. she added trade tensions are like a pot that was bubbling for a long time and is now boiling over. to a large extent, what we see is the result of an erosion of trust trust in the international system, and trust between countries. data released by the eu agency eurostat showed that inflation in the eurozone rose 2.2 in march, compared with 2.3 in february. a measure of core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as petrol and food, dropped from 2.6 to 2.4 in the same period. the ecb said most measures of underlying inflation suggested that inflation would settle at around the 2 medium-term target on a sustained basis.

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
