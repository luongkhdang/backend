  Title: Karen Read's second murder trial revives debate over who killed her Boston police officer boyfriend
  Source: abcnews.go.com (2025-04-22 00:14:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article highlights the prosecution's focus on 'drinking, driving, deadly consequences,' echoing a common public safety narrative. This suggests an attempt to frame the case in a way that resonates with pre-existing public concerns, potentially influencing jury perception and minimizing focus on the defense's conspiracy claims.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the defense was prevented from implicating Colin Albert in their opening statements. This is intriguing because it suggests a limitation on the defense's ability to present their full case. What is the justification for this limitation, and how might it impact the jury's perception of the defense's claims?

  Title: Is Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated (CORT) Among the Best Guru Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts?
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-23 17:17:07)
  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. we recently published a list of 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. in this article, we are going to take a look at where corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort stands against other guru stocks to invest in. wall street seems to be breathing a little easier after the initial panic over president trumps tariffs earlier this month, but the rollercoaster is not over just yet. all three major indexes closed last week in the red, with the dow and nasdaq both dipping over 2, and the broader market down more than 1. even though markets remain closed on april 18 for good friday, the general consensus is that the worst of the trade war headlines might be dying down. marko papic, chief strategist of geomacro strategy at bca research, remains cautiously optimistic, noting that while the idea of president trump striking 90 trade deals in 90 days sounds ambitious, they will likely be small, symbolic wins that still help calm markets. that said, volatility is expected to continue, and papic predicts the broader market could dip again before bouncing back, potentially giving investors a buying opportunity. investors are deep in earnings season right now, and some of wall streets biggest banks have reported solid first-quarter results. a big part of their success came from their trading desks, which cashed in on the recent market volatility, especially in equities. however, despite strong numbers on paper, bank ceos remain cautious and are hesitant to make big moves right now because of the market uncertainty. the us dollar also just had its worst weekly performance since 2022. meanwhile, investors are playing it safe and rapidly buying bonds, which pushed the 10-year treasury yield down to around 4.28. while some investors are seeing the current market dip as a buying opportunity, daniel von ahlen from globaldata ts lombard says otherwise. he believes the risks of a recession are being seriously underestimated. even though trumps recent tariff halt gave markets a bit of a boost, ahlen thinks that bounce will not last. in his view, this is not the time to scoop up stocks on the cheap, he is actually advising people to sell into rallies and avoid the usual buy-the-dip strategy. ahlen suggests getting a bit more cautious and selective. instead of jumping into the whole market, he recommends focusing on defensive sectors, like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare, that tend to hold up better in downturns. the market uncertainty is reflected in etfs as well, which are often considered wiser investment options due to active management strategies and lower risk compared to individual investing. for example, the guru etf is down 8.30 year-to-date as of april 18. however, over the last 12 months, the fund has posted share price returns of 13.38. similarly, five-year share returns stand at an impressive 51.57. guru gives retail investors a way to tap into the top stock picks of major hedge funds at a relatively low 0.75 expense ratio. it offers a more affordable and flexible way to try and beat the broader market using expert insights. so, lets take a look at the best guru stocks to buy. a biologist in a lab coat studying a culture of cells to find a cure for metabolic disorders. for this article, we looked up the guru etf, which had 82 holdings as of april 18. next, we manually searched for the average upside potential of each stock and selected 11 stocks with the highest values. the list below is ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of april 18. we have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment as of q4 2024. why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? the reason is simple our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. our quarterly newsletters strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4 since may 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points see more details here. number of hedge fund holders 29 average upside potential 117.48 corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort is an american biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for endocrine, oncologic, metabolic, and neurological conditions. their approved drug, korlym, helps manage high blood sugar in adults with cushings syndrome. cort is one of the best guru stocks to invest in, with an average upside potential of 117 as of april 18. on april 3, piper sandler raised the price target on corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort from 128 to 131 and maintained an overweight rating on the stock after strong phase iii results for relacorilant in treating platinum-resistant ovarian cancer proc. piper sandler sees proc as a billion-dollar market that could play a big role in corcepts future growth. the company plans to file for us approval in q3 2025, followed by a submission in the eu. corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort set records for both new korlym prescribers and patients in the fourth quarter of 2024. as awareness of hypercortisolism grows and more people are being screened, the company expects continued growth in its cushings syndrome business. revenue for the quarter reached 181.9 million, up from 135.4 million in q4 2023. total revenue for the year came in at 675 million, compared to 482.4 million last year. net income for the quarter was slightly lower at 30.7 million, but full-year net income increased to 141.2 million. corcept ended the year with 603.2 million in cash and investments and used 38 million for stock buybacks and employee stock options. according to insider monkeys q4 data, 29 hedge funds held long positions in corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort, up from 20 funds in the last quarter. jim simons renaissance technologies was the leading position holder in the company, with nearly 6.2 million shares worth 312.3 million. overall, cort ranks 5th among the 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. while we acknowledge the potential of cort as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that ai stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. there is an ai stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular ai stocks lost around 25. if you are looking for an ai stock that is more promising than cort but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest ai stock. read next 20 best ai stocks to buy now and 30 best stocks to buy now according to billionaires. disclosure none. this article is originally published at insider monkey.

Current Article 3 (ID: 130350):
  Title: Bank of England rate-setter says US tariffs likely to push down on inflation
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 11:13:59)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article touches upon aspects of Realism in international relations, specifically concerning trade and tariffs. The US imposing tariffs on the UK, as mentioned in the text ('the us has imposed a 10 import tariff on goods coming from the uk, a policy which also applies to many other countries'), exemplifies a state acting in its perceived self-interest to protect its economy, regardless of the impact on other nations. This action, and the UK's subsequent economic considerations, reflect the competitive and often conflictual nature of international trade relations as described by Realist theory.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents Megan Greene's analysis of potential disinflationary effects of US tariffs on the UK, but also acknowledges 'a tonne of uncertainty around this.' This uncertainty, coupled with the mention of 'both inflationary and disinflationary forces,' suggests a more complex and potentially volatile economic situation than a simple cause-and-effect narrative. What specific factors contribute most to this uncertainty, and how might they interact to produce unexpected economic outcomes?; Intriguing_angles: The opening section discusses the importance of 'parsing out the facts from the messaging' in the context of US politics, while the latter part focuses on economic analysis of UK inflation. This juxtaposition, while seemingly unrelated, could subtly imply that economic narratives are also subject to manipulation or biased framing. To what extent might political messaging influence the interpretation and presentation of economic data, and what mechanisms might facilitate such influence?

  Title: SURVEY: Half Americans Have Given Up On Saving Money...
  Source: studyfinds.org (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights the prevalence of financial insecurity among Americans, influencing public perception and potentially shaping policy priorities. The repeated emphasis on savings shortfalls and reliance on savings for emergencies, "67 of americans feel theyre lagging behind their savings targets. even worse, 47 have completely given up hope," frames the issue as a widespread problem. This can lead to increased public concern and demand for solutions.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Gen Z's relatively high satisfaction with their banks (71%) but also their willingness to switch (45%). This juxtaposition is intriguing because it suggests a potential disconnect between perceived satisfaction and actual loyalty. What specific factors, beyond those mentioned, might be driving Gen Z's willingness to switch banks despite their reported satisfaction? Could this indicate a deeper dissatisfaction with certain aspects of banking services that aren't fully captured by the satisfaction metric?

on average, americans try to save 496 each month, but this number doesnt tell the whole story. three in ten respondents 31 can only put aside 200 or less monthly. this limited capacitypaired with the need to withdraw for unexpected costshas left 25 of participants with smaller savings accounts now than at the start of 2025. generation x seems to be struggling the most, with 31 reporting decreased savingshigher than any other age group. millennials show more stability, with only 19 seeing their savings shrink and 39 maintaining steady balances. gen z displayed the strongest growth potential, with 38 actually building their savings during this period. americans are demonstrating incredible resilience and commitment to saving, even in challenging times, said erin bruehl, vice president of communications at current. the fact that people are actively trying to build emergency funds shows their commitment to financial responsibility. bruehl added, over 60 of people have needed to use their savings this year, highlighting exactly why americans are smart to try and build this financial cushion. their savings are successfully serving their intended purposehelping navigate both unexpected costs and ensuring they can maintain their essential needs. a generational divide the connections between americans and their banks reveal clear age differences in satisfaction and expectations. among gen z, 71 said their bank helps them reach financial goalsa satisfaction rate that drops steadily with age. only 61 of millennials, 51 of gen x, and just 41 of baby boomers shared positive feelings about their banking relationships. despite relatively high satisfaction, 52 of gen z thinks they could get better service elsewherehigher than other generations. three in ten gen zers find their banks benefits outdated, compared to only 11 of baby boomers who feel the same way. these perception gaps affect loyalty across age groups. a substantial 45 of gen z would consider switching banks, while only 21 of baby boomers would think about making such a changesuggesting banks face bigger challenges keeping younger customers who expect more from digital banking features and benefits. americans should select financial institutions that help them reach their goals, bruehl advised. online or mobile-only solutions often offer higher savings rates than traditional banks without monthly or minimum balance fees and provide additional benefits like early paycheck access and fee-free overdraft protection that provide additional cushion when bills are due. these benefits put more money in consumers pockets and can help people achieve their goals faster. the reality of american savings in todays economy the survey reveals americans trapped in a financial bind they know saving matters but face constant obstacles that derail their progress. using savings accounts as emergency funds rather than long-term growth vehicles points to a broader issue where many people struggle to build both emergency reserves and future savings simultaneously. for financial institutions, these findings highlight opportunities to better serve customers by offering relevant benefits, higher interest rates, and tools that help people track progress toward goals even during times when withdrawals are necessary. the challenges reflect broader economic conditions where rising living costs, flat wages in many sectors, and economic uncertainties continue to pressure household finances.

  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-02 14:47:57)

to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. donald trump is preparing to unveil a raft of new tariffs on wednesday afternoon in what the president has repeatedly billed as liberation day. trump has promised to roll out reciprocal dollar-for-dollar tariffs on nations that levy duties on u.s. goods as part of an aggressive attempt to fulfill his administrations america first agenda and correct years of what he deems unfair trade. international markets wait tentatively as the president is expected to unveil his plans at 4 p.m. wednesday at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden at the moment american markets close. plans remain under wraps with trumps team reportedly weighing options through tuesday. however, white house press secretary karoline leavitt stated that the president had already decided his course of action and that the tariffs would go into effect almost immediately. the only way to avoid the new levies, she said, is to move production to the u.s. it follows the liberal candidate for a critical seat on the wisconsin supreme court, susan crawford, who defeated conservative brad schimel in a race seen as a referendum on trump and his billionaire adviser elon musk. former republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is on board with an effort by democrats in the upper chamber led by senators tim kaine, amy klobuchar, and mark warner to end donald trumps made-up emergency that the president has declared against canada allowing him authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on the u.s.s northern neighbor. trump claims the authority by declaring a national emergency caused by the flow of fentanyl and undocumented migration from canada as well as mexico and china. president trump is saying that there is an emergency with canada. canada is a friend, not an adversary. canada is a sovereign nation, not a 51st state, senator kaine of virginia said on tuesday. this morning, cnns haley talbot reports that the list of republicans who will vote yes on a tariffs resolution up for a vote today at around 7 p.m. has grown to include the former gop leader of the senate. kaine said he approached mcconnell last night and didnt even get to the question before the kentucky senator said im with you. other republicans in support of the move to at least symbolically rebuke the president on his trade policy just a few hours after his liberation day announcement on reciprocal tariffs expected to cover a large swathe of u.s. trading partners include senators susan collins, lisa murkowski, and rand paul. senator thom tillis also told cnn that he doesnt plan on voting for kaines resolution, but has some concerns with the trade policies being discussed, adding, we need to see what comes out tomorrow wednesday and be instructed by that before we take action. earlier, trump wrote in part on truth social mitch mcconnell of kentucky, susan collins of maine, lisa murkowski of alaska, and rand paul, also of kentucky, will hopefully get on the republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize canada for the sale, into our country, of large amounts of fentanyl, by tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy. they are playing with the lives of the american people, and right into the hands of the radical left democrats and drug cartels. the senate bill is just a ploy of the dems to show and expose the weakness of certain republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the house will never approve it and i, as your president, will never sign it. after breaking the record for the longest senate speech in history, cory booker now seems to have broken the internet, with a slew of praise, memes and even tiktok videos commemorating his mammoth achievement. the new jersey democrat took to the senate floor on monday evening, saying he would remain there as long as he was physically able. the speech lasted a whopping 25 hours and 5 minutes. mike bedigan looks at some of the online reactions. it was fitting that cory booker was recounting a story about the late civil rights leader john lewis as he entered the 19th minute and 24th hour of a historic speech to the senate on tuesday evening. in that moment, the first black senator for new jersey broke a record for the longest speech ever made in congress, one that was set 67 years ago by the segregationist democrat strom thurmond, who spoke for a day and a night in opposition to the civil rights act. overcome with emotion, booker looked up to the ceiling and touched his heart as his fellow democrats in the chamber applauded his effort. one of msnbcs morning joe hosts is delighting in the fact that the wisconsin supreme court candidate backed by elon musks lost - even after the tech mogul dumped millions into the race. wisconsin voters elected liberal justice susan crawford to the states supreme court on tuesday, beating brad schimel by more than 200,000 votes in the most expensive judicial election in u.s. history. the vote keeps the high courts 4-3 liberal majority intact. musk repeatedly played up the stakes of the election, claiming it will direct the destiny of humanity and the future of the world is at stake. now, morning joe host joe scarborough is reveling in the massive loss musk suffered. katie hawkinson reports from washington, d.c. the u.s. has sent a three-person team to myanmar to help respond to the 7.7-magnitude earthquake, in a move criticized as weak and irrelevant by a former aid official. much larger russian and chinese teams have already been helping search-and-rescue efforts in the country for days. steffie banatvala reports. a mother and her three children were wrongfully detained by immigration enforcement agents in new york and taken to a detention facility in texas, a nonprofit says as it calls for their release. immigration and customs enforcement officers detained the mother - whose birth country was not disclosed - and her kids, one of whom is in third grade, on march 27 while they were executing an arrest on a farm in sackets harbor, new york, according to the new york immigration coalition. kelly rissman reports. elon musk broke his silence after suffering defeat in the wisconsin supreme court race, which cemented a liberal majority for the next three years. susan crawfords win keeps the court under a 4-3 liberal majority in the face of crucial litigation surrounding abortion access, voting rights and redistricting. like president donald trump, musk chose to focus on the background win of wisconsin voters approving the constitutional amendment to enshrine voter id laws, a vote that was being held at the same time as the supreme court race. this was the most important thing, musk posted on x in response to a post on voter id. madeline sherratt has the full story. kelly loeffler, former georgia senator and now head of the small business administration in the trump administration, hailed donald trumps liberation day as the single greatest salvation, for not just small businesses, but for america, during an appearance on fox business this morning. the president eagerly posted a clip of her conversation with maria bartiromo to his truth social account italys prime minister giorgia meloni and the countrys top business lobby warned on wednesday that impending u.s. tariffs could significantly impact the nations exports and its already struggling economy. it is clear that the introduction of new tariffs would have heavy repercussions for italian producers, meloni said while hosting a prize-giving ceremony for italian cuisine in rome. meloni added that she did not rule out adequate responses to protect the exports of the euro zones third largest economy, though she did not provide further details. italy recorded a trade surplus with the united states of 39 billion euros 42.14 billion in 2024, the third largest in the 20-nation euro area, according to eurostat data. earlier on wednesday, the business association confindustria reported that italys economy is expected to grow by 0.6 this year, half of the governments official target and down from a 0.9 forecast made by the group in october. the economy expanded by a modest 0.7 in both 2024 and 2023. it managed to achieve 0.1 growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the previous three months, after stagnating in the third quarter. most analysts do not foresee any significant rebound in the near term. confindustria indicated that while its forecasts accounted for the already-announced u.s. tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as what it termed record levels of uncertainty regarding trade policy, they did not consider the effects of an escalating trade war. in a worst-case scenario, with permanent 25 u.s. tariffs on all imports, rising to 60 for china, coupled with retaliatory measures against u.s. exports, italys growth could decline to around 0.2 this year, it said. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Trump warned US economy to be hit hardest by tariff war: Live updates - The Independent
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 15:31:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Realism, one might interpret the trade policy discussions as reflecting a state-centric view where national economic gain is prioritized, potentially at the expense of global stability. The text notes the 'aggressive tariff plans' and the claim that they 'would produce great benefits for american workers' while simultaneously acknowledging the negative impact on 'nearly all countries' and the risk of 'global recession'. This aligns with a realist perspective where states pursue self-interest in a competitive international system, viewing economic interactions through a zero-sum lens.; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory appears relevant in examining how specific issues gain prominence. The article highlights media reports (NBC News, Bloomberg, BBC) focusing on the Hegseth information leak and the economic consequences of tariffs, alongside official statements (Leavitt on student loans, Vance on tariffs, Bessent on China). This suggests that the selection and emphasis of these topics by both media and officials shape the public agenda, potentially diverting attention from or amplifying certain narratives over others.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents conflicting or potentially erroneous naming conventions for administration officials. Textual Basis: It refers to a 'press secretary karoline hegseth' and later 'white house press secretary karoline leavitt', and mentions 'treasury secretary scott bessent' immediately after discussing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a way that could cause confusion. Significance: Such inconsistencies, if not simple typos, could suggest reporting errors or a lack of clarity in official communication, potentially impacting the perceived reliability of the information presented. Probing Questions: Are these naming variations indicative of reporting inaccuracies, and how might such details influence a reader's trust in the overall narrative? What does the juxtaposition of the Defense Secretary and Treasury Secretary discussions imply about the article's structure or underlying connections the author perceives?

fund, told the bbc on tuesday. the u.s. economy will be one of the hardest hit by the aggressive tariff plans, the imf warned earlier in the day as it slashed forecasts for global economic growth, with the u.s. dropping to just 1.8 percent, from a previous forecast of 2.7 percent. the global economic growth forecast was cut by half a percentage point, with downgrades in nearly all countries amid ongoing uncertainty from the trump administrations trade policy. this came after vice president jd vance admitted that president donald trumps aggressive tariff increases will profoundly change the u.s. economy and other nations. in a speech in india, vance said the rebalancing from aggressive tariffs would produce great benefits for american workers. earlier, gold prices surged to a record high while the value of the u.s dollar plunged, following trumps latest attack on the federal reserve chair jerome powell. press secretary karoline hegseth was asked about embattled defense secretary pete hegseth at todays white house briefing. she told reporters that president donald trump continues to stand behind hegseth. white house press secretary karoline leavitt has announced that the education department will resume involuntary collections for defaulted student loans on may 5th. they will recoup loans and go after tax refunds, federal pensions and even their wages, of those who owe money. if you take out a loan, you have to pay it back very simple, leavitt said. defense secretary pete hegseth pulled the airstrike information he posted into signal chats with his wife, brother and dozens of others from a secure communications channel used by u.s. central command, raising new questions as to whether the embattled pentagon head leaked classified information over an open, unsecured network. nbc news first reported that the launch times and bomb drop times of u.s. warplanes that were about to strike houthi targets in yemen details that multiple officials have said is highly classified were taken from secure u.s. central command communications. a person familiar with the second chat confirmed that to the associated press. press secretary karoline leavitt confirmed president donald trumps upcoming travel plans at todays white house briefing. the president will depart washington, d.c., on friday to travel to rome for the funeral of pope francis on saturday, returning that evening. from may 13-16, the president will travel to saudi arabia, qatar, and the united arab emirates all key allies in the gulf. this thursday, norways prime minister jonas gahr stoere and finance minister jens stoltenberg will meet with trump at the white house. president donald trump has said that the u.s. stands strong with india against terrorism, after todays deadly attack in kashmir. read more about the attack here former vice president al gore lashed out at the trump administration in a fiery speech about the climate crisis, comparing its attempts to create their own preferred version of reality to that of adolf hitlers third reich. ariana baio reports from new york. kenneth rogoff, a former chief economist of the international monetary fund, says that if president donald trump doesnt retreat on his tariffs, the chance of a u.s. recession and subsequent global recession is almost 100 percent. rogoff was speaking to bbc radio 4s pm programme in the u.k. today. defense secretary pete hegseth doubled down during a tuesday morning fox and friends interview, insisting that the information on airstrike launches and bomb drop times that he shared with his wife, brother, and dozens of others in two separate signal chats was not classified. hegseth didnt deny the existence of a separate chat instead, he attacked the media and his former staff, whom he accused of leaking information about the chats. his repeat denial comes as nbc news reported tuesday that the information hegseth posted came directly from secure communications from the head of u.s. central command, gen. erik kurilla. the pentagons inspector general is investigating the chats. the material kurilla sent included details about when u.s. fighters would take off and when they would hit their targets details that could, if they fell into the wrong hands, put the pilots of those fighters in grave danger. but he was doing exactly what he was supposed to providing hegseth, his superior, with information he needed to know and using a system specifically designed to safely transmit sensitive and classified information. but then hegseth used his personal phone to send some of the same information kurilla had given him to at least two group text chats on the signal messaging app, three u.s. officials with direct knowledge of the exchanges told nbc news. the sequence of events, which has not previously been reported, could raise new questions about hegseths handling of the information, which he and the government have denied was classified. in all, according to the two sources, less than 10 minutes elapsed between kurillas giving hegseth the information and hegseths sending it to the two group chats, one of which included other cabinet-level officials and their designees and, inadvertently, the editor of the atlantic magazine. one of them was composed of hegseths wife, brother and attorney and some of his aides. treasury secretary scott bessent told a closed-door investor summit tuesday that the tariff standoff with china is unsustainable and that he expects the situation to de-escalate, bloomberg reports. bessent made the remarks at a jpmorgan chase event on the sidelines of the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings in washington, d.c. he added that negotiations between the u.s. and china have not yet started but that a deal is possible, according to people who attended his session, which wasnt open to the public or media. u.s. stocks rose after his comments, with the sp 500 index gaining as much as 2.9 as of 1228 p.m. in new york, while the dollar and treasuries steadied. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: How might Trump tariffs affect UK business on ‘Liberation Day’?
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-01 23:32:28)
  Content: analysis sweeping changes set to affect the uk and ultimately large parts of the world from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep

americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. liberation day as the white house grandly calls the unveiling of its new trade policy is finally upon us. but what it actually means and what the impact will be is still not clear, as president donald trump keeps businesses and world leaders waiting until wednesday to unveil the next round of tariffs. while mr trump has suggested all nations will be hit with additional levies and sir keir starmer has admitted the uk is unlikely to escape the new measures its still far from certain exactly which industries will bear the brunt this time, with steel, aluminium and auto parts already subject to additional import costs. heres a look at whats already known, what could happen, and what investors are doing as uncertainty reigns. the top end of the uk stock market has performed relatively well this year, considering concerns over growth, inflation, still-high interest rates and the wider geopolitical landscape. the ftse 100 is up more than 5 per cent year-to-date, in contrast to the us sp 500 being down around the same amount. the uncertainty has hit smaller businesses more, with the ftse 250 down 5.2 per cent in 2025 and the aim all-share index down 4.3 per cent. more recently, while there was a sell-off on monday ahead of these new tariffs, it eventually wasnt as steep as had initially looked the case and tuesday saw investors buying once more on price weaknesses, perhaps hinting that some saw limited further downside in share price terms, even with new tariffs to come. it has always been a fools game at guessing the stock markets most immediate, very next move, but aj bell analysis notes that while the biggest tech stocks in america the so-called magnificent seven have lost a combined 2.3 trillion in the first quarter of this year, they have strong growth prospects well into the future and that status makes them natural candidates to attract widespread buying when markets are more upbeat. in the uk, defence stocks in particular have fared strongly so far, with a domestic political strategy based on increased spending in this area pushing share prices higher while the price of gold, a traditional safe haven for investors, has repeatedly hit new record highs this year and is predicted by some analysts to rise even further across 2025. price hikes and job losses could have a total global economic toll of 1.4 trillion 1.1 trillion under the worst-case scenario according to aston business school. that is if full global retaliation with reciprocal tariffs is the eventual outcome, which would see the us economy in particular hit. naturally, if the entire planet is affected to that scale, the uk wouldnt be exempt, but theres still scope for changing trade paths, perhaps seeking out partners to increase back-and-forth business with if a reliance on the us is no longer plausible. quite aside from the businesses involved, government spending could also be impacted. last week, rachel reeves noted the government was laying out savings to restore 9.9bn of headroom for government expenditure. one assessment of a worst-case scenario involving trump tariffs and the uk suggests that would be entirely and immediately wiped out. david miles, from the office for budget responsibilitys obr budget responsibility committee, told mps if tariffs at 20 25 per cent were put on the uk and maintained for five years, our assessment of what that does is that it will knock out all the headroom that the government currently has. had we made that a central forecast, and had the government not changed policy at all knowing that we were going to take that as our central forecast, then the headroom would have pretty much all gone. mr miles noted the improbability of the extreme scenario, which would include a term beyond the next us presidential elections, but the obr further noted the hit to business confidence across the uk caused by the uncertainty around tariffs and other costs. at the other end of the scale, theres the perspective that some changes could in fact mean the uk might actually benefit from a trade war. again, its important to note thats on a broad, all-encompassing term there would still be businesses or industries negatively affected within that. but the obr noted that if the uk avoided involvement in a trade war, reciprocal tariffs and the like, some redirected trade flows could end up increasing business this side of the water. much of that is based around the fact that the uk-us trade deficit is far more reasonably balanced than, for example, the eu-us one. professor irina surdu-nardella, of warwick business school, told cnbc tariffs could yet have a limited impact on the uk. effects would be relatively limited to industries such as fishing and mining, ms surdu-nardella said, pointing to the service-focused nature of the uk economy meaning much of it would be unscathed by import tariffs. of course, theres also the possibility that mr trump and mr starmer find an agreement whereby british companies end up entirely unaffected by the whole process, potentially giving them a foothold to gain further business with overseas customers. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see

  Content: analysts warning of high risk us now enters recession this year after unveiling blanket global tariffs from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. the london stock exchange has opened sharply, down one per cent as a whole by 930am bst, in the wake of donald trump applying a ten per cent tariff to imported goods from the uk. that includes a small amount of ground recovered following an even steeper opening, while around europe there are even bigger drops in evidence, with germanys dax down 1.3 per cent and frances cac 40 down almost 1.7 per cent. the hardest hit sectors in the ftse 100 include banks and investment trusts, with standard chartered suffering the biggest drop in share price of 7.5 per cent in early morning trading. hsbc 5.0 per cent, barclays 4.4 per cent and lloyds 1.96 per cent also suffered hits in the finance sector. those falls suffered by investment trusts are partly related to their own holdings of overseas stocks, in particular those stateside. earlier, stock prices fell sharply overnight in the us following donald trumps announcement of global tariffs. a blanket 10 per cent starting point and significant increases on certain countries means imports into the us will be more costly with almost instant effect, impacting manufacturers and consumers alike. as a result of the tariff announcement, analysts at barclays are foreseeing a high risk of a recession in the us this year, as well as increased inflation up to or beyond four per cent and higher than expected unemployment levels. in the more immediate term, investors reacted by sending share prices significantly lower, with the futures markets showing entire indices pointing lower and individual companies even harder hit in many notable cases. the sp 500 and the nasdaq are both more than three per cent down in after-hours trading, while smaller companies seem even harder hit, the russell 2000 down 4.38 per cent around 730 am uk time. thats after japans nikkei 225 ended the day more than three per cent lower in overnight trading, hitting an eight-month low following a strong run over the previous couple of years. after each ended between flat and two per cent up in trading on wednesday, the futures market show the so-called magnificent seven - alphabet, microsoft, amazon, nvidia, apple, tesla and meta - highlighting the dramatic drops and negative market reaction to trumps latest and biggest bout of tariffs. microsoft is faring best among that notable giant group and is down 2.92 per cent in pre-trading, while most of the others are in the five-to-six per cent bracket down. apple, however, is hardest hit initially - with a 7.14 per cent decline equivalent to around 240 billion 183bn being wiped off its market capitalisation value overnight. lindsay james, investment strategist at quilter, pointed out that the president deliberately waited until after the closure of the stock market stateside to announce his tariffs. trump has made it clear that this is the end of the established economic order, and he wants america calling the shots. these tariffs are stark and perhaps more aggressive than many in the market had been expecting. indeed, trump scheduled this press conference for after the stock market closes for good reason, with the us futures market falling sharply as a result of this speech, ms james said. ultimately, trump is playing a high risk game. he is risking stoking a fresh inflationary spiral in the hope that over time jobs and industry are restored to the us. this is following an election campaign where he promised to lower inflation and bring interest rates down. but, tariffs have rarely ended in positive outcomes, and signs are already pointing to weakening consumer and business sentiment and the risk of a slowing us economy. trump continues to tout tax cuts, but there remains very little detail on what this means or when they will come about. additionally, ms quilter reinforced the likelihood of further ups and downs in the stock market across the coming weeks, with the possibility of donald trump changing his mind one factor to go along with the potential for retaliation. markets will be wanting more detail on both this and further deregulation, and given the scale of these tariffs that may need to come sooner rather than later for us equities. for businesses it remains a very volatile and uncertain economic period, and this will be reflected by markets for the time being. investors will need be patient and calm, staying invested for the long-term, she said. at barclays, meanwhile, the risk for recession stateside is heightened - but also higher inflation is likely, along with further job losses. we estimate that higher tariffs will boost price and exert a drag on activity. this is because tariffs raise the price of final and intermediate imported products, adversely affecting domestic consumers raise the cost of investment in equipment and infrastructure generally result in retaliation from other countries, which hurts exporters and are associated with trade policy uncertainty, which causes businesses to delay capex investment and hiring. in the face of weaker growth in activity and employment, the unemployment rate tends to increase, read a report by analysts including marc giannoni. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

yeah, well, listen, that thats very good spinach what they serve. but you know, paul, to your point, you know, typically geopolitics sits well in the back seat of the car, if you will, and every once in a while, the driver, which is either interest rates or or corporate profits, who tends to sit shotgun, looks back and says, hey, pipe down. thats just not the case right now. we have this unfortunate series of events where we we obviously have the immediacy of tariffs, but we dont have the clarity on when well actually see tax reform, nor, as i mentioned earlier, when will we actually see more of an active dialogue across global officials. and so the initial salvo with respect to responses from macron, with responses to what we heard from china was, were not necessarily going to come immediately to the negotiation table. so what i think that means is theres probably some more spinach, if you will, being handed out by the by the passenger in the back seat to mix metaphors. but more importantly, what i think this challenges investors like us to think about is just, okay, where does that fundamental case ultimately kick in? what will consumers do? and wed already seen before the tariff announcements some bifurcation between higher income, middle income, and lower income consumers. and if anything, the risk is that gap widens and it widens more quickly. so some of the market reaction we think is that that time gap between moving from the the spinach course to the dessert course, but it also, i think, begs the question of when will we see a deterioration in consumer activity. were not going to learn a lot from the jobs data tomorrow. we will learn from what chair powell has to say with more of his forward views. but ill also just say this, this is actually not very well covered, but we had vice chair jefferson present today in atlanta. and again, very intelligent economist. he mentioned in the course of a 3,000 word presentation, this is the parsing that we do, he used the word tariff once in that entire presentation. so what i think that says is there may be a little bit of a of a hold off of a firm communication from the fed if were to use vice chair jeffersons guidance today. therell be a lot of focus on what we hear from chair powell tomorrow. reuters -institutional shareholder services has recommended pfizer investors reject a proposal on executive compensation at its upcoming annual meeting, citing concerns about certain changes made to long-term awards to its ceo and others. the modifications, including repeated changes to pfizers cash flow targets, and a lack of clarity about certain pipeline goals are concerning and undermine a pay-for-performance philosophy, iss said. annual incentives for executives are tied to achieving three financial goals, and payouts can be 30 percentage points higher or lower based on pipeline and esg-related goals achieved, iss said. cybersecurity stocks have not been immune from the recent market sell-off, opening up some attractive entry points for some of the top companies in the space. lets look at three cybersecurity stocks you might want to buy now and hold for the long term. while known for its next-generation firewalls, palo alto networks nasdaq panw has transformed itself into more of a complete cybersecurity company. buying high-quality dividend stocks is a great way to collect passive dividend income. the best ones increase their dividends each year, and they can help you more than offset the impact of inflation over the long run. federal realty investment trust nyse frt, nnn reit nyse nnn, and essex property trust nyse ess have elite records of growing their dividends. microsoft, alphabet, nvidia and amazon are part of the zacks top analyst blog. here are buffetts words on investing through a crisis. can you retire at 65 with 750,000 in a roth ira and 1,800 in monthly social security?

  Title: Bank of England rate-setter says US tariffs likely to push down on inflation
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-22 11:13:59)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article touches upon aspects of Realism in international relations, specifically concerning trade and tariffs. The US imposing tariffs on the UK, as mentioned in the text ('the us has imposed a 10 import tariff on goods coming from the uk, a policy which also applies to many other countries'), exemplifies a state acting in its perceived self-interest to protect its economy, regardless of the impact on other nations. This action, and the UK's subsequent economic considerations, reflect the competitive and often conflictual nature of international trade relations as described by Realist theory.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents Megan Greene's analysis of potential disinflationary effects of US tariffs on the UK, but also acknowledges 'a tonne of uncertainty around this.' This uncertainty, coupled with the mention of 'both inflationary and disinflationary forces,' suggests a more complex and potentially volatile economic situation than a simple cause-and-effect narrative. What specific factors contribute most to this uncertainty, and how might they interact to produce unexpected economic outcomes?; Intriguing_angles: The opening section discusses the importance of 'parsing out the facts from the messaging' in the context of US politics, while the latter part focuses on economic analysis of UK inflation. This juxtaposition, while seemingly unrelated, could subtly imply that economic narratives are also subject to manipulation or biased framing. To what extent might political messaging influence the interpretation and presentation of economic data, and what mechanisms might facilitate such influence?

milwaukee-based marquette law school. according to the late march survey of 1,021 adults, 45 percent of republicans now assess the state of the economy as excellent or good, while 46 percent view it as not so good and an additional 9 percent as poor. additionally, a majority of adults 58 percent believe trumps policies will result in higher inflation, with the number of republicans believing the president will reduce inflation declining from 76 percent in december to 62 percent in march. despite the president campaigning on the promise of lower prices and more favorable conditions for domestic businesses, polls and surveys have found that americans across the political spectrum are expressing anxiety about the overall health and trajectory of the u.s. economy in 2025. surveys revealing weak and declining consumer confidence have been cited, alongside other indicators, as evidence that the country may be on the brink of a recession, fears of which have been heightened by the administrations broad and expanding list of tariffs imposed on goods entering the u.s. according to the marquette poll, conducted between march 17 and 27, the share of american adults who now believe the economy is excellent or good has fallen to 26 percent from 27 percent in late january. the number assessing the economy as not so good has also dropped from 58 to 53 percent, though the percentage considering it in a poor condition has risen from 15 to 20 percent. fifty-eight percent of adults believe tariffs will harm the u.s. economy, while 28 percent say these will prove to be a benefit and 14 percent feel they make little difference. just over half of republicans 52 percent think tariffs help the economy, but 58 percent of independents and 89 percent of democrats consider tariffs harmful. the results of the survey are largely split along partisan lines, with the number of republicans saying that the country is moving in the right direction currently at 80 percent, compared to only seven percent before the election, and the number saying it is on the wrong track falling from 93 to 20 percent over the same period. only 11 percent of democrats, meanwhile, believe

16 percent of independents believe inflation will decrease, down from 26 percent in january and 28 percent in december. meanwhile, 92 percent of democrats say trumps policies will lead to higher inflation, up from 85 percent in january and 82 percent in december. trumps overall job approval has remained largely unchanged between january and march, currently enjoying 46 percent approval and 54 percent disapproval. his republican support is at 87 percent, down from 89 percent in january. approval among independents dipped from 37 percent to 32 percent, and edged up to 10 percent from nine percent among democrats. white house press secretary karoline leavitt, ahead of trumps liberation day tariff announcements, said this is obviously a very big day. he is with his trade and tariff team

voice is ai-generated. inconsistencies may occur. a swift and sharp sell-off in u.s. treasuries is rattling global financial markets, shaking the foundation of what has long been considered one of the worlds premier safe-haven assets. the u.s. treasury market, valued at nearly 29 trillion, underpins everything from global reserves to corporate borrowing costs. its stability is central to the functioning of the global financial system. a severe disruption in this market, like the current sell-off, could severely tighten financial conditions worldwide. if confidence in treasuries continues to erode, the u.s. may find itself paying more to finance its debt, exacerbating fiscal pressures at a time of persistent deficits and geopolitical tension. concern over the potential impacts of president donald trumps reciprocal tariffs, as well as retaliation from foreign trading partners, has rocked markets in recent days, with wider fears that their inflationary effects could push the u.s. economy closer toward a recession. u.s. treasuries are debt securities issued by the u.s. department of the treasury to finance the federal governments spending when its revenues are insufficient to cover its expenses. yieldsthe interest rate on treasuriesspiked on wednesday as trumps reciprocal tariffs took effect, signaling that investors are offloading their government bonds in large numbers. the yield on 10-year treasuries jumped to more than 4.5 percent shortly after midnight, with 30-year yields surpassing 5 percent and two-year yields briefly reaching above 3.8 percent. u.s. government bonds were the safe-haven investment for the worlds investors because they were seen as the rock in a turbulent world, said paul de grauwe, a professor in european political economy at the london school of economics. now the u.s. government is the preeminent source of turbulence and unpredictability. no wonder investors are looking for another rock. the new reciprocal dutiesaimed at eliminating trade deficits and reshoring american manufacturingwent into effect for dozens of countries on wednesday. a 104-percent tariff on chinese imports also began overnight, after beijing missed the deadline to withdraw its 34-percent retaliatory tariff on u.s. goods. bloomberg reports that foreign reserve managers, including china, may be reconsidering their u.s. government debt holdings due to trumps trade policies. reuters noted that much of the selling was done by hedge funds to raise cash for margin calls, as the value of their portfolios continues to decline amid the ongoing market rout. reuters compared the sell-off to the 2020 dash-for-cash panic that prompted 1.6 trillion in emergency federal reserve purchases. similarly, british economist and former chief adviser to the bank of england charles goodhart told newsweek that the sudden sell-off could be tied to the continued drop in global stock prices. the technical problem is that the sharp decline in equity prices has required those who have levered up their position in equities to raise cash to meet margin calls, and that might have led them to sell treasury bonds as the best way in these circumstances to meet cash requirements, goodhart said. during the month of january, 10-year interest rateswhich is probably the most important rate in the country, since mortgages and capital formation are based on ithad almost spiked to 5 percent, treasury secretary scott bessent said in a recent interview with tucker carlson. and i think 5 percent can be an uncomfortable area for the economy, for the treasury, for issuing bonds. in an interview with fox business in early february, bessent said that the administration would be paying close attention to the 10-year treasury yields to assess when the federal reserve might cut interest rates. the administration has been pushing the federal reserve to cut rates, but the potential inflationary impacts of trumps tariffs could limit the central banks ability to do so, reuters reported. with growing fears of stagflationslow economic growth coupled with rising inflationthis creates a difficult situation for fed chairman jerome powell. to address slower growth, fed officials can reduce the benchmark interest rate to make borrowing cheaper and boost investment. however, the central bank normally raises rates in order to combat inflationary pressures. meanwhile, the u.s. dollar index fell under 102 points for the first time since the presidential election. calvin yeoh, portfolio manager at hedge fund blue edge advisors pte, told bloomberg this is a fire-sale of treasuries. i havent seen moves or volatility of this size since the chaos of the pandemic in 2020. british economist and former chief adviser to the bank of england charles goodhart told newsweek the longer-term structural problem is that the tariffs will raise u.s. inflation significantly, at a time when the administration wants to cut taxation sharply, is overestimating revenue from tariffs, and is trying to put pressure on the fed to cut interest rates. in addition, what foreigners are likely to want to buy treasury bonds now? so, the underlying structural condition looks to be one of increasing potential unsustainability of the u.s. fiscal position with a significant danger of accelerating inflation. under these circumstances, u.s. t bonds will look increasingly risky over the medium to longer term, even if in the short run the federal open market committee cuts short-term interest rates quite sharply, he added. a very sharply rising yield curve would then develop. paul de grauwe, professor of political economy at the london school of economics, told newsweek if there is no quick reversal of economic policies, the u.s. treasuries will indeed lose their safe-haven status. it will not come back soon, as the u.s. government is seen as unreliable much in the same way as governments of banana republics are. the trump tariffs are one of the most spectacular self-harm decisions a government has made in history, he added. it will lead to further negative effects for the u.s. economy. the sell-out of treasuries is just one in a series of further self-inflicted economic negative events. a recession is now inevitable. trumps reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries took effect on wednesday. the administration has indicated that there will be no pause on the duties, though trump has suggested that he may be open to cutting fair deals, with certain countries. newsweek is committed to journalism thats factual and fair. hold us accountable

  Title: Team Trump defends tariffs as bipartisan opposition grows, markets slide
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-06 18:36:37)
  Content: trump administration officials blitzed television networks sunday to defend the presidents massive tariffs that have caused a sell-off in the stock market and triggered recession fears, arguing that the import taxes are already forcing dozens of countries to come to the bargaining table. fifty countries were burning the phone lines into the white house to negotiate with president donald trump, agriculture secretary brooke rollins told cnns state of the union. dont panic, white house senior counselor peter navarro said on fox newss sunday morning futures. and treasury secretary scott bessent, speaking on nbcs meet the press, dismissed predictions from economists and banks that there would be a recession. the full-court press from cabinet members and advisers came as the administration is under immense pressure to pull back on the tariffs, which have caused the biggest loss in american stock market wealth since the panicked sell-off as covid-19 spread in march 2020. a growing number of conservatives are pushing back against trumps moves, with a nonprofit backed by right-wing megadonor charles koch leading a lawsuit against the tariffs, while some republicans in both chambers of congress are organizing a legislative effort to roll them back. and though administration officials remain in lockstep in their support of trump, some of the presidents most vocal supporters are beginning to question the moves. speaking via video call to a conference of italian right-wing politicians on saturday, billionaire trump funder elon musk said he hopes europe and the united states will eliminate all tariffs between them. hedge-fund investor bill ackman, a regular defender of trump, said on x on saturday that he thinks the president will delay the tariffs on monday as trump works through negotiations with countries that are willing to lower their own trade barriers. the risk of not doing so is that the massive increase in uncertainty drives the economy into a recession, potentially a severe one, ackman wrote. ben shapiro, the right-wing pundit and co-founder of the daily wire, called the tariffs probably unconstitutional and illogical, and the wall street journals editorial board, as well as guests on fox news, have criticized the tariffs. meanwhile, liberal politicians are lambasting the president, as did tens of thousands of protesters who took to the streets of washington and cities around the country on saturday in what appeared to be the biggest demonstrations against trump since he took office in january. trump hanging tough still, trump is holding the course. on saturday, he implored followers on his social media platform truth social to hang tough. this is an economic revolution, and we will win, he said. trump administration officials offered two main justifications for the tariffs, saying they are meant to accomplish the long-term goal of completely reforming the american economy while giving the u.s. increased negotiating power to strike new trade deals. this is the ultimate dealmaker who is a businessman at the head of our government, rollins said. at the same time, the agriculture secretary framed the tariffs as part of a long-overdue new american order to protect u.s. industries. though she insisted the dip was a product of the markets adjusting, rollins acknowledged short-term uncertainty for american farmers, noting that the white house is ready to deploy financial aid to them if needed. some of the countries criticized by trump for putting tariffs on american imports, such as india, do so to keep prices stable for their own farmers. financial analysts from global banks, including barclays, bank of america, deutsche bank and the royal bank of canada, have all said the u.s. stands a higher chance of entering into a recession if the tariffs are not pulled back. j.p. morgan economists and analysts see a 60 percent chance of a recession happening this year. but bessent said sunday that the economy remains strong. there doesnt have to be a recession, bessent said, calling the 6 trillion stock-market drop a short-term reaction and comparing the current moment to the early days of ronald reagans presidency. he also rejected warnings from economists and skeptical fellow republicans, arguing that the tariffs are a one-time price adjustment and not a source of lasting inflation. bessent declined to say whether the tariffs are permanent but said they have given trump maximum leverage to renegotiate trade terms. the market consistently underestimates donald trump, he added. were going to hold the course. navarro, for his part, told americans to hold on to their stock portfolios despite cratering share prices. right now the smart strategy is not to panic, just stay in, because we are going to have the biggest boom in the stock market we have ever seen under the trump policies, he said sunday. we will find a bottom in this market quickly. we will hit 50,000 on the dow easily by the end of this term. the dow jones industrial average, a basket of stocks representing 30 big, well-known companies, hit an all-time high of just over 45,000 in december. it was at around 38,000 when the market closed friday which came on the heels of the worst quarter for stocks since spring 2022. meanwhile, gop opposition to the tariffs is growing. rep. don bacon r-nebraska said sunday on cbss face the nation that on monday he will unveil some of the support for his house bill, a companion to a senate bill that aims to bring back control of tariffs to congress. the move is notable because the house has already passed a procedural vote to prevent the chamber from voting on any proposed bill ending trumps emergency declaration on tariffs against mexico, canada and china. it will be harder to pass this in the house, no doubt, bacon conceded. i think if we get 60 votes in the senate itll put pressure on the house to look at this, and if we continue to see the stock market go in a certain direction or if we see inflation or unemployment shift in a bad way, i think this bill becomes very viable. people voted for trump because of inflation, immigration and crime, he noted, adding, i dont think tariffs was really a big factor in peoples decision-making in electing him last november. while trumps cabinet members claimed that dozens of countries are trying to reach the president to negotiate, democrats seized on the fact that trump had spent some of the weekend playing golf. that may end up being the most enduring image of the trump presidency, sen. adam schiff d-california said on nbcs meet the press. the president out on a golf cart while peoples retirement is in flames. while theres growing bipartisan support in congress to rein in trumps tariff authority, the moment demands immediate action, schiff added.

  Title: Stock market rallies after closed-door remarks by Treasury Secretary Bessent - Fortune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 20:15:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The recurring mentions of 'Trump tariffs' and 'Trump policy changes' alongside discussions of corporate hits (RTX), market reactions ('volatility spike', 'markets open sharply higher'), and geopolitical shifts ('softens on china', 'china de-escalation') align with aspects of Political Economy theory. This perspective suggests that political decisions and the actions of key political figures (like Trump) are not merely isolated events but have direct, measurable consequences on economic actors (companies like RTX, markets) and international economic relations (China trade). The text provides evidence of this linkage by explicitly connecting policy actions (tariffs, changes) to economic outcomes (hits, market shifts).; Theories_and_interpretations: The juxtaposition of headlines about market reactions to political statements ('investors are finally taking trump seriously', 'markets open sharply higher after trump softens') and the mention of 'agenda-setting' in the context of financial news (implied by the focus on specific topics like tariffs, Fed Chair, China) could be viewed through the lens of Agenda-Setting Theory. While typically applied to media influence on public perception, here it highlights how the *focus* of political figures (Trump's statements on China, Powell) can directly influence the *agenda* of financial markets and news coverage, demonstrating the power of political rhetoric to shape economic attention and action, as evidenced by the immediate market response described.; Intriguing_angles: The text mentions 'doges staffing cuts' as a cause for the IRS's 'nightmare' tax season and potential refund delays. The term 'doges' is unusual in this context and lacks clear identification as a standard entity type (Organization, Government Agency). Its significance lies in being presented as a direct causal factor for a major government agency's operational failure, yet its nature remains undefined within the article. What entity or concept does 'doges' represent in this context, and why is it presented as a singular, impactful cause without further clarification?

  Title: Michael Goodwin: Trump bets the White House — and GOP control of Congress — on tariffs
  Source: nypost.com (2025-04-05 20:09:02)
  Content: maybe all that winning was becoming boring. whatever the reasons that led president trump to rock the globe with his liberation day tariff regime, the immediate result has been a world of hurt for millions upon millions of americans. the stock market meltdown that wiped out some 6.4 trillion of value last thursday and friday means many households saw 10 or more of their nest eggs suddenly erased. their pain is matched only by their confusion about why the president triggered the sell-off. after all, trump 2.0 was scoring major successes by sealing the border and deporting alien criminals. the doge audit was proving his claims of massive government waste and fraud. similarly, his crackdown on columbia and other universities that allow hamas supporters to harass and intimidate jewish students is rattling the radicals where it hurts most in their multimillion dollar federal grants. meanwhile, his election provided a big boost to the economy, which has been humming along. because he has been faithful to his campaign promises, polls show trump with the highest approval rating hes ever had. his winning streak is not the only thing in jeopardy. given the tumult on wall street and in markets around the world, its reasonable to conclude that trump is betting his presidency and gop control of congress on the tariff gambit. that probably wasnt his plan, but like it not, thats how its playing out. the early returns are not promising. by 15 percentage points, voters hold a negative view of trumps handling of inflation and most oppose his emphasis on tariffs, a wall street journal poll finds. negative views of his economic stewardship outweigh positive views by 8 points, according to the survey, which was completed before markets tanked last week. public doubts about the economy are dramatic when you recall how important the subject was to trumps victory. his attacks on bidenomics and inflation became a key reason why trump swept the seven swing states and his party carried congress. yet demoralized and divided democrats now smell blood as some voters begin to sour. the disruption caused by the tariff war is so severe that jpmorgan economists predict it could take a big bite out of americas gross domestic product this year and warn that if, the tariffs remain in place, there is a 60 chance of a global recession. federal reserve chairman jerome powell, no fan of trumps to start with, said the tariffs could lead to both higher inflation and slower growth. naturally, the fear gauges are also rising among congressional republicans. texas sen. ted cruz said friday that if the tariff war pushes the us into a recession, particularly a bad recession, 2026 in all likelihood politically would be a bloodbath. you would face a democrat house, and you might even face a democrat senate. none of this is certain, of course, nor is it meant to suggest trumps goal isnt worthy. leveling global trade is admirable and a core tenet of his america first approach. he aims to protect and expand domestic manufacturing and create good, well-paying jobs by giving more companies incentives to move their headquarters and factories to the united states. its been a consistent theme since he entered politics in 2015 with a rousing denunciation of the globalists whose unfair trade practices hollowed out large industries in middle america. and he celebrated his 2024 win by hosting business titans at mar-a-lago who promised to invest in america. among them was japans softbank, whose chief executive pledged to invest 100 billion. thats the point of tariffs to incentivize companies to make their products and create jobs in the us. meanwhile, the taxes on imported products also provide washington with a source of revenue, with the white house predicting as much as 700 billion would be collected this year under the new rates, which would help fund tax cuts. if they are reciprocal, which trump insists he wants, tariffs would even the score by punishing imported goods at the same rate as countries do that impose high taxes on american products sold abroad. a prime example of the current imbalance was noted by white house adviser stephen miller why is that if you go to tokyo, theres no american cars, if you go to berlin, theres no american cars, but on our streets, we have every foreign car there is? he added theyve blocked their markets from our cars. president trump is saying that has to end. although the president has repeatedly denied it, the suspicion that the aim is to get trading partners to negotiate was effectively confirmed by trump himself friday afternoon. just had a very productive call with to lam, general secretary of the communist party of vietnam, who told me that vietnam wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s., he posted on truth social. but the first inkling of good news came just hours after china raised its tax on american products to 34, saying reciprocal levies were necessary to stop trumps bullying. subscribe to our daily post opinion newsletter! please provide a valid email address. by clicking above you agree to the terms of use and . china, of course, has long been the poster child of trade imbalances. a study from the us international trade commission reports that the sheer volume of chinas exports to the us outpaced americas exports to china by three to one in 2024. even a sneering axios concedes the facts, writing that china has a long record of trade abuses ip theft, forced technology transfers, state subsidies and market access restrictions for foreign companies. it continues the european union doesnt cheat the way china does. but it protects its own through generous agricultural subsidies and strict regulatory standards that often double as trade barriers. the vat, europes value added tax that can go as high as 27 in some countries, is another barrier on us imports. thus, with restrictive trade practices by other nations, theres often not much difference between friend and foe. leaving aside the predictable legacy media reaction to the turmoil one suspects there was glee in the new york times newsroom over the markets plunge and trumps political predicament there are also conservative skeptics. most of their doubts center on two elements the enormous size of the tariffs and the decision to unleash them all at once. some suggested that more modest rates and an industry-by-industry approach could be more effective because it would focus on specific countries and products, such as steel and aluminum. what do you think? post a comment. another argument is that onshoring cannot happen overnight. for foreign manufacturers to make a decision to relocate means building a facility in the us, hiring workers and producing goods a process that could take many months if not years. trump doesnt have years. the midterm elections are 19 months away. share your stance. please adhere to our the new pm of canada nailed it, he called for zero tariffs between canada and the us so both can become economic powers. this is part of the plan, drive new negotiations that favor the us economy and consumer. but the media wont ever admit that because of tds. im curious to what the next great t. a week of stock market activity doesnt mean that much, really. trump is trying to fix something that has been broken for years, and any change brings anxiety to people. will it work? we will have to wait and see, and the good news about tariffs is that they can be removed or lowered just as quickl. over the past couple of days i have seen videos of obama, pelosi and schumer talking about the unfair us trade tariff balance, especially with china. not one of them did anything to correct it though as it would hurt them politically. i give trump credit for at least trying to level the field. i do. i agree yes we need to fix the tarriff balance but a little at a time so as to preserve the lives of us citizens especially the elderly

  Title: CNBC Daily Open: Trump’s desire to intervene in Fed could cause chaos
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-21 01:00:03)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Principal-Agent Theory, the article illustrates the tension between President Trump (the principal, driven by political incentives) and Jerome Powell/the Fed (the agent, mandated for economic stability). The text notes Trump's 'repeated calls for federal reserve chair jerome powell to cut interest rates' and the White House assessing 'whether they can remove the fed chair.' This highlights how the principal's desire for short-term economic boosts (pleasing the populace) can conflict with the agent's long-term goal of controlling inflation, suggesting structural challenges to central bank independence under political pressure.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article's focus on tariffs ('trumps tariffs, which are taxes on imports...') and fees on Chinese ships ('found chinas acts, policies and practices were unreasonable and burden or restrict u.s. commerce') aligns with Economic Nationalism. This theory interprets state actions as prioritizing domestic economic interests and power, often through protectionism and strategic industrial policy (like China's 'made in china 2025 plan' aiming for 'domestic dominance'). The narrative frames international economic interactions as a competition for advantage rather than purely free-market exchange.; Intriguing_angles: The draft executive order on the State Department, mentioned alongside economic news, proposes closing embassies and cutting bureaus for 'democracy and human rights, as well as international organizations like the united nations.' This detail, though brief, suggests a potential reorientation of U.S. foreign policy away from traditional diplomatic and values-based engagement. What might be the implications of de-emphasizing these foreign policy tools for the administration's economic and trade objectives? Could this indicate a shift towards a more transactional, economically-focused definition of U.S. global interests?; Intriguing_angles: The justification for U.S. fees on Chinese ships is attributed to an investigation by the 'biden-trump administrations.' This unusual phrasing suggests continuity in this specific area of trade policy across two distinct presidencies. What does the specific mention of the 'biden-trump administrations' imply about the bipartisan nature or deep-seated origins of concerns regarding China's trade practices? Could this phrasing be intended to lend greater policy legitimacy by framing the action as a consistent U.S. stance rather than a partisan initiative?

  Content: taken from cnbcs daily open, our international markets newsletter subscribe today an independent central bank is seen by most including this newsletter as the bedrock of a functional economy. officials steer the economy by calibrating the benchmark interest rate on which bank loans and mortgages, among other debt, are based. corporations and consumers, in general, like low interest rates because the cost of borrowing is cheaper. the former is incentivized to expand and invest, which, in turn, tend to increase income and spending among the latter. but such behavior can overheat the economy, causing prices to shoot up. u.s. president donald trumps repeated calls for federal reserve chair jerome powell to cut interest rates might make businesses and people happy at the cost of letting inflation run rampant again. factor in trumps tariffs, which are taxes on imports and hence fundamentally price increases, and inflation could be getting two shots in the arm. thats why central bankers tend to operate independently from the government. an administration that aims to please the populace might cut rates despite high inflation, leading to further economic difficulties. its a relief markets in the u.s. and europe were on a break for the good friday holiday when trump made his comments. trump again calls for powell to cut ratesu.s. president donald trump said friday that if we had a fed chairman that understood what he was doing, interest rates would be coming down, too. the white house said friday that officials are assessing whether they can remove the fed chair. this is not the first time trump has criticized powells approach to u.s. monetary policy. growing disapproval of trumps economic handlingaccording to a cnbc survey of 1,000 americans, 55 of respondents disapproved of trumps handling of the economy, the first time in any cnbc poll that he has been net negative on the economy while president. more americans now believe the economy will get worse than at any time since 2023, and they are sharply more pessimistic about the stock market, according to survey results. economic activity might fall off in summerthe u.s. economy could be experiencing an elevated level of activity now as shoppers and businesses stock up on goods before tariffs kick in, chicago fed president austan goolsbee said sunday. activity might look artificially high in the initial, and then by the summer, might fall off because people have bought it all. sectors most affected include the auto industry and electric components, goolsbee said. executive order to overhaul state departmentthe trump administration could soon roll out sweeping changes to the u.s. state department, according to a 16-page draft executive order obtained by cnbc. if enacted, the order would shutter american embassies across southern africa, eliminate bureaus that work on issues like democracy and human rights, as well as international organizations like the united nations. u.s. to impose fee on chinese-built shipsthe trump administration on thursday announced fees on chinese-built vessels after an investigation by the biden-trump administrations found chinas acts, policies and practices were unreasonable and burden or restrict u.s. commerce. the new fee charges are based on the net tonnage of a vessel. the fees will be charged once per voyage and not per port, as originally proposed. ukraine signs outline of mineral deal with u.s.yulia svyrydenko, ukraines minister of economic development and trade, said thursday the country and the u.s. had signed a memorandum of intent that was the basis of an agreement for both nations to jointly develop ukraines natural resources. however, on friday, u.s. secretary of state marco rubio said america will walk away from trying to broker a russia-ukraine peace deal within days unless there are clear signs that a deal can be done. pro earnings might displace tariffs as focusmarket gyrations because of trump tariffs might be subdued but not entirely subside this week, according to strategists. investor attention will turn to first-quarter earnings reports, with tesla and alphabet announcing their performance on tuesday and thursday, respectively. when beijing released its made in china 2025 plan in 2015, it was met with significant international criticism for promoting chinese business at the expense of their foreign counterparts. the country subsequently downplayed the initiative, but has doubled-down on domestic tech development given u.s. restrictions in the last several years. since releasing the plan, china has exceeded its goals on achieving domestic dominance in autos, but the country has not yet reached its targets in aerospace, high-end robots and the growth rate of manufacturing value-added the european chamber of commerce in china said in a report last week, citing its research and discussions with members. out of ten strategic sectors identified in the report,

  Title: European Stocks Sink Into Correction as Trade Worries Escalate - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-04 16:06:11)
  Content: bloomberg - european stocks tumbled into a correction on friday as china retaliated against us tariffs, escalating the global trade war. most read from bloomberg housing agency aims to relocate its dc headquarters metro-north is faster than acela on nyc-new haven route after signal updates local governments vie for fired federal workers what would transportation abundance look like? london clears final hurdle for more high-speed trains to europe the stoxx europe 600 index slid 5.1 at the close in london, recording its worst weekly drop since the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic five years ago. indexes in italy, france, switzerland and germany were also in correction territory after news that beijing would impose a 34 tariff on all imports from the us, starting april 10. banks were the biggest laggards, with the stoxx 600 banks index sinking as much as 10. italys ftse mib index weighed down by the weakness in banking stocks led losses among major european benchmarks with a 6.5 slide. every portfolio has to adjust themselves for a recession in a lot of countries, said david kruk, head of trading at la financiere de lechiquier. yesterday, the us bore the brunt of the selloff. now its our turn. still, data showing better-than-expected us job growth in march was somewhat reassuring, according to amelie derambure, senior multi-asset portfolio manager at amundi sa. if the data had been really bad, it would have led to the conclusion that the trump administration and the uncertainty around its policies were already triggering a recession, said derambure. traders had earlier boosted their expectations for the us federal reserve to cut interest rates this year. among individual stock movers, gerresheimer ag fell 15 after bloomberg news reported kkr co. has walked away from a consortium discussing a takeover of the german maker of drug packaging. here is what market participants are saying max kettner, hsbc chief multi-asset strategist we dont think the correction is over yet. in fact our measures of sentiment and positioning are still ambiguous at best. our momentum signals indicate that typical trend-following strategies are still only medium short, and equity exposure on our measure of long-only investors has barely budged so far. equity market breadth in the sp500 is nowhere near capitulation levels yet, and in fact is even still much higher than during the rates-driven dip in january. the average stock has actually been flat ytd until yesterday, so we do think theres quite a bit more pain to come until the fed put can step in vincent juvyns, global market strategist at jpmorgan asset management let me be clear, in no way is this capitulation, its a slap in the face but this is not capitulation. indeed you can see that its the best performing stocks and indexes that are falling the most, like banks, because thats where investors can take their profits. but let me be clear and i say that with conviction for a long term investors, this selloff creates a lot of buying opportunities. the selloff is overdone in my opinion. yes theres going to be macro-economic consequences to the tariffs but my point is that for diversified investors, bonds are perfectly doing their job in cushioning the fall in equities neil birrell, chief investment officer at premier miton investors the bifurcation youre getting within different markets is extraordinary. within equities, its get out of anything thats rate-sensitives, get into safety aneeka gupta, head of macroeconomic research at wisdom tree uk ltd its unprecedented to see this in the second day in a row. chinas response is predominantly setting the stage. the likelihood now is that if with china leading the way, were likely to get more countermeasures being put in place by other economies. right now for market, you could compare it with catching a falling knife. its quite a difficult situation janet mui, head of market analysis at rbc brewin dolphin i think people are fleeing for safety now because the situation appears to be spiraling downward. it is hard to see a scenario where most of the tariffs will be rolled back in the near term. the sentiment shock is going to inflict a lot of harm for both the u.s. and elsewhere raphael thuin, head of capital markets strategies at tikehau capital today weve entered an escalation phase with countries starting to retaliate and its not possible to know how this will end. we must get used to the idea that this a regime change growth expectations will be cut down and inflation forecast revised upwards. even if one ignores for a minute the immediate market action, long term, the horizon has darkened. whats also worrying is that central banks wont be in a position to weigh in that much given that this new cycle is an inflationary one susana cruz, panmure liberum strategist it looks like investors are playing it safe, with the announcement of chinese retaliations adding to the already growing recession risks. they seem to be bracing for more bad news, as sectors with strong momentum before the tariffs, like european banks and industrials, face a deeper selloff. quality stocks and low volatility are providing some shelter amid the storm. for more on equity markets timing to go defensive has rarely been better taking stock ma watch europe kkr, gerresheimer, carrefour, shell,

  Title: Stocks, Dollar Sink on Threats to Fed Independence: Markets Wrap - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-21 14:22:55)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism. The article highlights a power struggle between President Trump and the Federal Reserve, specifically targeting Jerome Powell.  Evidence: "president donald trump stepped up criticism of jerome powell", "trump is studying whether hes able to fire powell", "rebuking the fed risks politicizing us monetary policy".  Interpretation: This aligns with Realist theory, where states (or in this case, branches of government and powerful individuals) are seen as primary actors vying for power and influence. Trump's actions demonstrate an attempt to exert political control over monetary policy, traditionally considered independent, to achieve desired economic outcomes and potentially consolidate power. This could signal a shift towards prioritizing political expediency over institutional norms.; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory. The news article prominently features President Trump's criticisms of the Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell, framing their actions as detrimental to the economy. Evidence: "president donald trump stepped up criticism of jerome powell on social media", "insisting there was virtually no inflation and it was time for preemptive cuts", "trump is studying whether hes able to fire powell". Interpretation: By repeatedly and publicly attacking the Fed, Trump is attempting to set the agenda, influencing public perception and potentially market expectations regarding monetary policy. This relentless criticism, amplified by news media, can shape the narrative around the Fed's performance and pressure them to adopt policies favored by the administration, regardless of the central bank's independent assessment of economic conditions. This illustrates how political actors can leverage media to influence policy discourse and potentially outcomes.; Intriguing_angles: Omission of Counterarguments. The article heavily emphasizes concerns about the Fed's independence being threatened by President Trump's actions and the potential negative market reactions. Textual Basis: The article quotes analysts predicting 'huge injection of volatility' and 'most dramatic rush to the exit from US assets' if Powell is fired. Significance: While presenting a clear narrative of risk, the article notably lacks substantial counterarguments or alternative perspectives. For instance, it does not explore potential benefits of lower interest rates advocated by Trump, nor does it delve into arguments for greater political accountability of the Fed. Probing Questions: Could this selective presentation of viewpoints contribute to a biased understanding of the situation? What are the potential implications of not fully exploring the rationale behind the political pressure on the Federal Reserve?; Intriguing_angles: Implicit Assumption of US Hegemony. The article discusses 'de-dollarisation' and 'move away from US hegemony' as realistic fears arising from the Fed's potential politicization. Textual Basis: 'not only is the independence of the fed clearly under threat, but the prospect of de-dollarisation and a move away from us hegemony is an increasingly realistic one.' Significance: This statement implicitly assumes the existing global order is centered around US dollar dominance and US hegemony, and that actions threatening the Fed's independence could undermine this order. It treats this hegemony as a given, rather than a potentially contested or evolving aspect of international relations. Probing Questions: Is the assumption of unchallenged US hegemony warranted in the current geopolitical landscape? Could the article's framing inadvertently reinforce a US-centric worldview by presenting de-dollarisation as inherently negative without exploring alternative perspectives on a multipolar financial system?

  Title: US Treasuries Gain as Trade War Spurs Inflation and Growth Angst - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-04 21:02:26)
  Content: bloomberg - treasuries climbed as the fallout from president donald trumps tariffs convulsed markets for another day. most read from bloomberg housing agency aims to relocate its dc headquarters metro-north is faster than acela on nyc-new haven route after signal updates local governments vie for fired federal workers what would transportation abundance look like? london clears final hurdle for more high-speed trains to europe two-year yields fell notes fell to their lowest since september 2022 earlier in the session and benchmark 10-year yields slumped as much as 17 basis points to 3.95. but the rally faded somewhat after a solid us jobs and comments from fed chair jerome powell suggested that the central bank is focused on the impact of tariffs on inflation dashed expectations for immediate rate cuts. still, money markets have priced in nearly four quarter-point rate reductions this year, up from just three cuts before the levies were announced wednesday. listen to the heres why podcast on apple, spotify or anywhere you listen everything today is being driven by the expectation that the economy is going to take a major hit, said jan nevruzi, an interest-rate strategist at td securities. earlier in the session, china announced it would impose a 34 tariff on all imports from the us, raising the specter of a global trade war. later, powell said the economic impact of new tariffs is likely to be significantly larger than expected. it was the central bank chiefs first public appearance since march 19, when policymakers opted to hold rates steady, as expected. then, the fed lowered median projections for gdp and lifted those for inflation. still, powell said after the meeting that policymakers base case was that a tariff-induced inflation bump would be transitory. on friday, trump urged the fed to cut interest rates, one day after he said he welcomed the slide in 10-year yields. treasury secretary scott bessent has said repeatedly that lower treasury yields are a priority for the administration. trump will tell them to feel the market and eventually they will cut not in may, though, said neil dutta, head of us economic research at renaissance macro research. powell is focused on inflation expectations even as financial conditions have tightened. thats hawkish, all else equal. the ongoing reaction across markets has been stark. the sp 500 saw its worst two-day plunge since march 2020 in a rout that has shed about 5 trillion in value, with the gauge down 6 on friday. the nasdaq 100 entered a bear market. markets have priced in a roughly 50 probability of a quarter-point rate reduction at the next fed meeting in may. some traders are even betting on an emergency rate cut before the may 6-7 meeting, with open interest in the april fed funds futures soaring. many of the moves persisted even after march employment data released friday showed that 228,000 nonfarm jobs were created, exceeding the 140,000 median forecast of economists in a bloomberg survey. january and february job gains were revised lower, though, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2. what bloomberg strategists say. a lot of this bond market rally will have to be reversed in the next couple of months. and with no relief from discount rates implied by treasury yields, equities will suffer even more as a consequence. this is stagflation with inflation as the binding constraint. edward harrison, the everything risk newsletter, washington the bond market is seeming to keep its focus on the tariff news, said zachary griffiths, head of investment-grade and macroeconomic strategy at creditsights. european bonds have been swept up in the bond rally, anticipating a hit to growth from the 20 us tariff. germanys 10-year yield, the regional benchmark, has plunged this week, erasing the surge unleashed by the nations increased spending plans in march. traders also expect the european central bank to lower rates more sharply, with three quarter-point reductions fully priced in for this year and a chance of a fourth. the bank of england also is seen easing 74 basis points. the global bond surge even saw sub-zero rates return in some corners. the bid yield on two-year swiss government bonds turned negative for the first time since 2022. the swiss national bank cut its key policy rate to 0.25 from 1.75 last year, and traders are betting on at least another quarter-point cut by the end of 2025, with some hedging for further easing. bloomberg economics estimates us tariffs could reduce us demand for swiss goods goods by around 60. for mark dowding, chief investment officer at rbc bluebay asset management, the repricing has already gone far enough. he doubts that both the fed and ecb will be able to respond to tariffs with monetary easing, citing inflationary concerns in the us and an emphasis on fiscal support in europe, and is instead looking for entry points to bet against bonds once markets settle. the rally in bond yields appears overdone, he wrote in a note. we think the fed will do nothing for the foreseeable future, as long as there is not a large rise in unemployment. treasuries have already rallied 3.8 this year, according to a bloomberg gauge of us debt. in the us, fed officials have said that a resilient labor market and sticky inflation mean they can afford to stand pat, even as trumps tariffs sapped consumer and business confidence. this jobs report is going to create an absolute mess for the fed response to economic risks, said guy lebas, chief fixed income strategist for janney montgomery scott. the best case for risk assets is that the data deteriorate quickly enough to generate a fed response. the bad case for risk assets is that jobs muddle through in the face of warmer short-term inflation prints. economists generally expect that tariffs will lift inflation and slow growth, keeping the fed in wait-and-see mode. but the tariffs unveiled wednesday were larger than anticipated, clouding the picture. while morgan stanley now expects no cuts this year, down from one previously, citing inflation risks, ubs global wealth management see more easing this year. vineer bhansali, chief investment officer and founder of longtail alpha, said hes buying two-year notes and selling 30-year bonds, a trade known as a curve steepener. its a bet that a slowing economy will force the fed to lower interest rates, while elevated inflation would lead long-term bonds to underperform. that growing wager is reflected in the market, with the yield difference between two-year and 30-year bonds widening. the distribution of possible outcomes has gotten flatter, bhansali said. anything can happen. now that the us has

  Title: Americans braced for era of uncertainty as Trump doubles down on tariffs
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-06 12:00:50)
  Content: since donald trump returned to the white house, americans have grown used to high drama and rapid-fire headlines, as executive orders from the oval office have reshaped the us, from stripping back lgbtq rights to gutting environmental regulations amid a sense that the us is slipping into authoritarianism. but even against that backdrop, last week stood out, as trump launched a fierce global trade war, imposed tariffs on its trading partners and triggered a global market meltdown, including on trumps own cherished wall street, where hundreds of billions of dollars of stock values evaporated. now, with all eyes nervously on mondays markets amid fears that the calamitous drops will continue, recession fears are mounting in america. jp morgan analysts last week boosted their odds on a global recession to 60 and americans are bracing for a return of inflation the thing that above all else likely doomed trumps predecessor, joe biden. but trump remained unmoved by market drops and the global political condemnation and even rare criticism from his own republican party saying now is a great time to get rich and that china played it wrong they panicked. on the streets of new york too, there was panic among some. in washington square park, two sisters from detroit were sitting on a park bench nearby the magnolia trees now in bloom. kathleen, a primary school teacher, said she worried about whether there was a plan in place before changes are made. i want to be optimistic, but i live under an umbrella of worry with this administration, kathleen said. i worry about the leadership, worry about a lack of continuity within the leadership, and so many changes at once without a plan. her sister, elizabeth, said shed grown so anxious shed stepped back from the news. our mum definitely had a huge jump in anxiety over this past week over her investments. she worked hard for those and she lives on them a retired schoolteacher, and the drop in stocks very much impacts her day-to-day feeling of security. but leo ezekiel, 39, had a different perspective. as a financier, he wasnt so worried about the stock markets. its mostly that big corporations are deciding to sell off, and that will affect people, but in the long run, if stocks go down, it gives room for them to move up. its part of the game and its always been like that in the united states. trump made his move because he dreams of a return of american manufacturing might, convinced that tariffs will force factories home to the us, even though almost all economists think that is highly unlikely. yet, for such a momentous decision which has rattled the entire world economy, trump reportedly only made up his mind at the last minute. according to the washington post, trump didnt arrive on an exact plan until just three hours before the rose garden announcement. the liberation day announcement from the white house was a choreographed event, and his speech drew cheers from audience, largely made up cabinet members and blue-collar workers from manufacturing sectors that have for decades been economically pummeled by foreign competition. he offered up a vision that tariffs would bring back an older american economy, reopening factories and returning prosperity to ordinary workers. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump complained. but it is not going to happen any more. vice-president jd vance said weve seen closing factories, weve seen rising inflation. weve seen the cost of housing so high that most americans cant afford to buy a home right now, vance said. president trump is taking this economy in a different direction. americas largest trading partners, mexico, canada, china, germany and japan, were less enthusiastic, to say the least. china has announced retaliatory duties of 34 the canadian prime minister mark carney announced a limited set of counter-measures and called the us moves a tragedy for 80 years of free and open exchange of goods and services, led by the us. the british pm keir starmer said nothing would be off the table when it came to the uks response to the tariffs the uk imports 76.2bn in us services but that just as with defence and security the world was entering a new era in economy and trade. it is one where answers to even the most basic questions remain unknown. will trumps tariffs on us trade partners go down as an act of economic self-sabotage? or are tariffs merely a negotiating ploy to influence other nations war by other means? or is trump finally getting to express his long-held economic view that the us has been making bad deals for decades?

doesnt give a fuck. hes going to do what hes going to do. hes going to do what he promised to do on the campaign trail. but even some former trump economic officials privately expressed doubts that returning the us to an era of manufacturing self-sufficiency was likely impossible. the author michael wolff, who has published four books about trump in power, says the us president will now be keenly gauging how his interruption into global trade norms is going down, with updates and live-action replays provided by aides. trump, wolff says, is likely caught between two opposing instincts. its great for him hes dominating the news once again. nobody is talking about anything else except tariffs. suddenly, tariffs, an arcane piece of trade policy, are the most dramatic thing in the world that hes imbued with reality-show stuff. hell be really pleased with that. but on the other hand, wolff predicts, trump will be watching the financial markets. hell have the business guys calling up saying what the fuck are you doing? im sure he hasnt come to any conclusion. so on the one hand its great hes the worlds leading guy again. on the other, it might collapse in on him. and that, he adds, is the essence of trump. hes fundamentally self-destructive, but that self-destructive impulse is exactly what keeps him at the forefront of the news.

  Title: US Stocks Push Higher After Bessent’s Remarks: Markets Wrap - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 16:13:42)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article's emphasis on market reactions immediately following reports of potential policy shifts ('SP 500 rose... after bloomberg news reported closed-door comments') suggests that the *reporting* of information, even from private sources, is framed as a primary driver of financial sentiment. This highlights how media focus can influence what investors perceive as the most critical factors (trade tensions, Fed policy), potentially shaping market behavior based on perceived importance rather than solely on concrete economic fundamentals.; Theories_and_interpretations: The description of President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve ('berated powell for being slow to cut interest rates', 'concerns that trump may be preparing to fire powell') and the subsequent market 'reappraisal' of havens ('Trumps policies and his broadsides against the Fed have forced a reappraisal of the dollar and treasuries') aligns with aspects of Political Business Cycle theory. This perspective suggests that political actors may seek to influence monetary policy for short-term gains, and the market's reaction indicates a recognition of potential political interference impacting institutional independence and financial stability perceptions.

  Title: Trump's tariff gambit will raise the stakes for an economy already looking fragile - CNBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-01 18:19:40)
  Content: president donald trump is set wednesday to begin the biggest gamble of his nascent second term, wagering that broad-based tariffs on imports will jumpstart a new era for the u.s. economy. as the president prepares his liberation day announcement, household sentiment is at multi-year lows. consumers worry that the duties will spark another round of painful inflation, and investors are fretting that higher prices will mean lower profits and a tougher slog for the battered stock market. what trump is promising is a new economy not dependent on deficit spending, where canada, mexico, china and europe no longer take advantage of the u.s. consumers desire for ever-cheaper products. the big problem right now is no one outside the administration knows quite how those goals will be achieved, and what will be the price to pay. people always want everything to be done immediately and have to know exactly whats going on, said joseph lavorgna, who served as a senior economic advisor during trumps first term in office. negotiations themselves dont work that way. good things take time. watch trumps tariffs are expected to raise prices. but by how much? for his part, lavorgna, who is now chief economist at smbc nikko securities, is optimistic trump can pull it off, but understands why markets are rattled by the uncertainty of it all. this is a negotiation, and it needs to be judged in the fullness of time, he said. eventually were going to get some details and some clarity, and to me, everything will fit together. but right now, were at that point where its just too soon to know exactly what the implementation is likely to look like. heres what we do know the white house intends to implement reciprocal tariffs against its trading partners. in other words, the u.s. is going to match what other countries charge to import american goods into their countries. most recently, a figure of 20 blanket tariffs has been bandied around, though lavorgna said he expects the number to be around 10, but something like 60 for china. what is likely to emerge, though, will be far more nuanced as trump seeks to reduce a record 131.4 billion u.s. trade deficit. trump professes his ability to make deals, and the saber-rattling of draconian levies on other countries is all part of the strategy to get the best arrangement possible where more goods are manufactured domestically, boosting american jobs and providing a fairer landscape for trade. the consequences, though, could be rough in the near term. on their surface, tariffs are a tax on imports and, theoretically, are inflationary. in practice, though, it doesnt always work that way. during his first term, trump imposed heavy tariffs with nary a sign of longer-term inflation outside of isolated price increases. thats how federal reserve economists generally view tariffs a one-time transitory blip but rarely a generator of fundamental inflation. this time, though, could be different as trump attempts something on a scale not seen since the disastrous smoot-hawley tariffs in 1930 that kicked off a global trade war and would be the worst-case scenario of the presidents ambitions. this could be a major rewiring of the domestic economy and of the global economy, a la thatcher, a la reagan, where you get a more enabled private sector, streamlined government, a fair trading system, mohamed el-erian, the allianz chief economic advisor, said tuesday on cnbc. alternatively, if we get tit-for-tat tariffs, we slip into stagflation, and that stagflation becomes well anchored, and that becomes problematic. the u.s. economy already is showing signs of a stagflationary impulse, perhaps not along the lines of the 1970s and early 80s but nevertheless one where growth is slowing and inflation is proving stickier than expected. goldman sachs has lowered its projection for economic growth this year to barely positive. the firm is citing the the sharp recent deterioration in household and business confidence and second-order impacts of tariffs as administration officials are willing to trade lower growth in the near term for their longer-term trade goals. federal reserve officials last month indicated an expectation of 1.7 gross domestic product growth this year using the same metric, goldman projects gdp to rise at just a 1 rate. in addition, goldman raised its recession risk to 35 this year, though it sees growth holding positive in the most-likely scenario. however, luke tilley, chief economist at wilmington trust, thinks the recession risk is even higher at 40, and not just because of tariff impacts. we were already on the pessimistic side of the spectrum, he said. a lot of that is coming from the fact that we didnt think the consumer was strong enough heading into the year, and we see growth slowing because of the tariffs. tilley also sees the labor market weakening as companies hold off on hiring as well as other decisions such as capital expenditure-type investments in their businesses. that view on business hesitation was backed up tuesday in an institute for supply management survey in which respondents cited the uncertain climate as an obstacle to growth. customers are pausing on new orders as a result of uncertainty regarding tariffs, said a manager in the transportation equipment industry. there is no clear direction from the administration on how they will be implemented, so its harder to project how they will affect business. while tilley thinks the concern over tariffs causing long-term inflation is misplaced smoot-hawley, for instance, actually ended up being deflationary he does see them as a danger to an already-fragile consumer and economy as they could tend to weaken activity further. we think of the tariffs as just being such a weight on growth. it would drive up prices in the initial couple inflation readings, but it would create so much economic weakness that they would end up being net deflationary, he said. theyre a tax hike, theyre contractionary, theyre going to weigh on the economy. join us at the new york stock exchange!uncertain markets?

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
