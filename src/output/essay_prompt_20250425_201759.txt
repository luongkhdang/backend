  Title: Trump tariffs set stage for wave of profit warnings
  Source: finance.yahoo.com (2025-04-03 09:53:55)
  Content: by medha singh reuters - u.s. businesses have talked a lot about tariffs in the past few months, but very few modeled for them in their earnings outlooks. with president donald trumps multi-front trade war now in full effect, investors and analysts expect a barrage of corporate profit warnings in the coming weeks that could jolt the stock market. trumps escalation of threats to major world economies since returning to office in january has increased fears that inflation will rise and disrupt economic growth. the u.s. benchmark sp 500 closed out its worst quarter in more than three years at the end of march. tariffs of 10 across all imports to the united states, along with much higher levies on dozens of countries, are now set to take hold just about a week before big u.s. lenders kick off the quarterly reporting season, and companies now need to factor in the rapid deterioration of business and consumer sentiment and falling optimism among company finance chiefs. throughout the first three months of 2025, tariffs were mentioned more than 800 times on investor events or conference calls by non-financial companies globally, according to sp global market intelligence, highest in at least 15 years and nearly double the level seen during trumps first trade war in 2018-2019. however, only about 88 u.s. companies specifically mentioned they had not modeled tariff impact into their forecast as the global trade outlook was still evolving, according to sp. numerous others were non-specific as to whether they had modeled the potential effect of tariffs - leaving open the possibility of numerous surprises on conference calls this quarter. wall street analysts still expect record profit in 2025, leaving room for more potential downgrades. sp 500 profits are expected to rise 8 year-over-year for the quarter as of march 28, down from a 12 growth forecast on jan. 17, according to data compiled by lseg. ceos will latch onto an opportunity to lower expectations even if its painful - they can just say its the stupid tariffs, or headwinds, or currency conversion, said mark malek, chief investment officer at siebert financial in new york. the fears about tariffs have introduced an element of uncertainty into the economy, with consumers and businesses in some cases putting off purchases as the white houses on-again, off-again approach to tariffs made the environment more unpredictable. that may benefit some companies in the short-term - car sales were notably strong in march, increasing the likelihood for strong figures from ford and general motors. but other companies rapidly brought in inventories, which could be a drag on results for other sectors.

  Title: US stock futures rebound after selloff; corporate earnings in focus - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 10:15:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory appears relevant as the article prominently features the political conflict between President Trump and the Federal Reserve Chair, as well as the impact of tariffs, immediately linking these factors to market movements. The text states the selloff was 'sparked by president donald trumps mounting criticism' and the rebound was helped by 'optimism on u.s. trade negotiations', suggesting these specific issues are framed as the primary drivers of market sentiment, potentially directing the reader's focus away from other underlying economic factors.; Theories_and_interpretations: Rational Choice Theory can be seen in the description of investor behavior. The article notes 'investors sifted through a slew of quarterly earnings' and 'awaited trumps next move', implying market participants are making decisions based on processing specific pieces of information (earnings data, political statements) to anticipate future outcomes (earnings hits, policy paths). This highlights the narrative's focus on investors as rational actors reacting to perceived risks and opportunities presented by political and economic developments.; Intriguing_angles: The phrase 'april 2 liberation day tariff announcement' is used to mark a point from which market declines are measured. The specific term 'liberation day' is unusual in this context and is not explained. What does the use of 'liberation day' in relation to a tariff announcement signify, and whose perspective might this framing represent within the broader trade narrative?; Intriguing_angles: The article emphasizes the 'relentless tussle' between Trump and Powell and 'rising tensions with the white house' regarding the Fed's autonomy. While presenting this as a market factor, the text doesn't delve into the institutional implications or the potential long-term effects on the credibility of independent economic institutions. How might this framing of a 'tussle' simplify or potentially misrepresent the complex relationship between political leadership and central bank independence, and what are the potential consequences for economic stability beyond immediate market reactions?

  Title: Tariff fallout in focus after stocks' worst week since 2020: What to know this week - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-06 11:38:45)
  Content: stocks just had their worst week since a global pandemic brought the world economy to a halt in march 2020. president trumps shocking tariff announcements on wednesday rattled markets ahead of the next days trading session. then, chinas announcement of reciprocal tariffs sent stocks further lower on friday. for the week, the dow jones industrial average dji pulled back almost 8, or about 3,300 points, to enter into correction territory. meanwhile, the sp 500 gspc sank roughly 9 as the broad-based benchmark approached a 20 drawback from its most recent all-time high. the tech-heavy nasdaq composite ixic led the losses, cratering 10 and ending in a bear market as its officially down 20 from its most recent all-time high. in the week ahead, investors will watch for updates on the status of tariff negotiations with other nations, as well as announcements of reciprocal tariffs on the us. trumps first round of 10 baseline tariffs is set to go into effect on april 5, and other wide-ranging additional tariffs are set to take hold on april 9. in other news, big bank earnings slated for friday will mark the unofficial start to first quarter earnings season. jpmorgan jpm, blackrock blk, wells fargo, wfc, and morgan stanley ms are all set to release results. delta dal and constellation brands stz will report on wednesday. in economic data releases, the consumer price index cpi on thursday is set to headline the week, with other releases on producer prices and consumer sentiment also in focus. one key question on investors minds is whether the stock market rout is over. wall street strategists have warned retaliatory tariffs would likely intensify the selling. if high tariff rates stay in place, negotiations are drawn out over a multi-month period and additional measures are taken with key trading partners, the risk of a recessionour bear case is likely to rise more materially, morgan stanley chief investment officer mike wilson wrote in a note to clients on thursday night. wilsons bear case projects the sp 500 to end at 4,600, a level not seen on the benchmark index since december 2023. market experts have pointed out that the tariff retaliation fallout likely isnt over. rsm chief economist joe brusuelas pointed out to yahoo finance that the european union, one of the uss largest trading partners, hasnt directly responded to the us tariffs yet. brusuelas argued the market doesnt have that priced in. investors fundamentally think this is just a repeat of 2018, brusuelas said. so theres a lot more damage that could go on here. with trump holding steady on his policy stance for now, investors have moved quickly to price in more fed interest rate cuts for this year. the moves come as economists have argued the risks of recession are rising as the tariffs stand to sharply hinder economic growth, and the broad-based equity market sell-off is proving to be an increasing risk to the health of the us economy. but on friday, fed chair jerome powell made no such concessions. its just too soon to say what the appropriate monetary policy response will be to these new policies, powell said. it is just too soon to say. we cant say with any confidence today. powell added that tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation and that its also possible that the effects could be more persistent. another key inflation reading for the fed will come on thursday with marchs consumer price index. wall street expects an annual gain of 2.6 for headline cpi, which includes the price of food and energy, down from 2.8. prices are set to rise 0.3 on a month-over-month basis, up from 0.2 in february. on a core basis, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, inflation is expected to have risen 3 year over year, a slowdown from the 3.1 increase seen in february. monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3 after falling more than 0.1 typically, a drop in inflation would be a welcome sign for markets. but in the current market moment headlined by uncertainty about whats to come, it might not be enough. the abrupt change in u.s. trade policy this week will make the march cpi feel like old news when it is released on thursday, wells fargos team of economists led by jay bryson wrote in a note to clients on friday. even as we forecast headline cpi to come in flat month-over-month in march, the looming effects of higher tariffs looks to throw a wrench in the fight against inflation. for all of two trading days, it looked like the initial public offering ipo market was reopening. shares of conservative news network newsmax nmax soared more than 1,000 in its first few trading days. ai software play coreweave crwv spiked 41 on tuesday. then trumps tariffs sent markets into a tailspin. multiple companies that had recently announced theyd be filing for an ipo are now backing off those plans. on friday, ticket platform stubhub delayed its road show presentations slated for next week, according to a report from the wall street journal. axios reported exchange platform etoro etto.pvt also halted its ipo plans. meanwhile, digital payments firm klarna klar.pvt, fintech company chime chim.pvt, and ad tech company mntn also reportedly hit the pause button. a crucial earnings season is set to kick off this week. amid all the policy uncertainty, the underlying question for investors has been just how badly trumps widespread tariffs will impact corporate profits. given this, what companies say about their outlooks for the rest of 2025 will be in particular focus. companies will be reporting first quarter earnings, which largely wont include the impact of any new trump policies. still, analysts have slashed their estimates for the first quarter by 4.2, per factset. thats higher than the five-year average of 3.3 and 10-year average of 3.2. still, consensus expects the sp 500 to grow earnings by 7 year over year in the first quarter and by 11.3 in 2025. that number is likely to come down. analysts often cut earnings estimates as the year goes on. but the big question from investors is just how far those estimates will come down and how different the chart below will look in a months time. economic data no notable economic releases. earnings dave busters play, levis levi economic data nfib small

  Title: IBM beats on earnings and revenue, maintains full-year guidance
  Source: www.cnbc.com (2025-04-23 20:14:08)
  Content: ibm reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the first quarter on wednesday. revenue increased 0.6 in the quarter from 14.5 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. net income slid to 1.06 billion, or 1.12 per share, from 1.61 billion, or 1.72 per share, in the same quarter a year ago. the company accelerated productivity efforts, jim kavanaugh, its finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. for 2025, ibm reiterated its expectation for 13.5 billion in free cash flow and at least 5 revenue growth at constant currency. at current exchange rates, currency will provide 150 basis points of benefit for 2025 growth, down from the companys forecast of 200 basis points in january. management called for 16.4 billion to 16.75 billion in second-quarter revenue. the middle of the range, 16.58 billion, is ahead of the lseg consensus of 16.33 billion. ibm has become more cautious about the contribution of consulting, kavanaugh said on the conference call. while sentiment and the operating environment have been rapidly shifting, our performance reflects the continued success of our focused strategy around hybrid cloud and ai, especially where clients are looking for cost savings, productivity gains and trusted partners to help them move fast and scale, ibm ceo arvind krishna said on the call. those needs remain front and center in todays market. before going deeper into our results, let me start by saying that we appreciate the administrations focus on economic growth and rational regulation, which will strengthen the us competitive position. we believe this will result in long-term value creation and make it easier for technology to contribute to economic growth. in the first quarter, software revenue rose 7 to 6.34 billion, in line with the consensus among analysts polled by streetaccount. the hybrid cloud software category that includes red hat grew 12, compared with 16 in the fourth quarter. ibms consulting unit contributed 5.07 billion in revenue, which was down 2 and slightly above streetaccounts 5.05 billion consensus. the companys infrastructure division, which includes mainframe computers, posted a 6 decline in revenue to 2.89 billion, higher than the 2.76 billion consensus. earlier this month, ibm introduced its z17 mainframe. infrastructure revenue growth generally picks up as customers adopt the next generation and then drifts down late in the cycle. during the first quarter, ibm said it had settled its lawsuits with chip manufacturer globalfoundries. ibm also closed its 6.4 billion acquisition of cloud software maker hashicorp and announced plans to buy data storage software startup datastax for undisclosed terms. ibm has been an outperformer this year as the broader market has sold off due largely to concerns around president donald trumps tariffs and their potential impact on the economy. as of wednesdays close, ibm shares were up 11, while the nasdaq was down almost 14. in the near term, uncertainty may cause clients to pause and take a wait-and-see approach, krishna said, adding that buying behavior has not meaningfully changed so far in the second quarter. no one is immune from fallout from president trumps tariffs on imported goods, kavanaugh said in an interview with cnbcs jon fortt. under 5 of ibms spending comes from goods imported to the u.s, he said on the call. ibms customers are prioritizing efficient spending and the preservation of cash, kavanaugh told the wall street journal. the u.s. department of governmental efficiency had delayed or nixed 15 federal contracts, he told bloomberg. federal consulting is less than 10 of consulting, krishna said. most of that federal consulting is critical rather than discretionary, he said. signings an estimate of spending commitments under consulting contracts would have been higher in the first quarter if not for clients hesitating before making buying decisions, kavanaugh said on the conference call. there are areas of our portfolio that could see greater variability in the event that the macroeconomic environment deteriorates, he said. this includes consulting, which is more sensitive to discretionary pullbacks and doge-related initiatives, consumption-based services and software, including in red hat and areas of distributed infrastructure. watch uncertainty is the market is short-term, says ibm ceo krishna got a confidential news tip? we want to hear from you. sign up for free newsletters and get more cnbc delivered to your inbox get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services. 2025 cnbc llc. . a division of nbcuniversal data is a real-time snapshot data is delayed at least 15 minutes. global business and financial news, stock quotes, and market data and analysis.

  Title: US Stocks Push Higher After Bessent’s Remarks: Markets Wrap - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 16:13:42)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article's emphasis on market reactions immediately following reports of potential policy shifts ('SP 500 rose... after bloomberg news reported closed-door comments') suggests that the *reporting* of information, even from private sources, is framed as a primary driver of financial sentiment. This highlights how media focus can influence what investors perceive as the most critical factors (trade tensions, Fed policy), potentially shaping market behavior based on perceived importance rather than solely on concrete economic fundamentals.; Theories_and_interpretations: The description of President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve ('berated powell for being slow to cut interest rates', 'concerns that trump may be preparing to fire powell') and the subsequent market 'reappraisal' of havens ('Trumps policies and his broadsides against the Fed have forced a reappraisal of the dollar and treasuries') aligns with aspects of Political Business Cycle theory. This perspective suggests that political actors may seek to influence monetary policy for short-term gains, and the market's reaction indicates a recognition of potential political interference impacting institutional independence and financial stability perceptions.

compared to a risk-free investment. its essentially the reward for bearing greater uncertainty. he observes a significant shift in market sentiment, moving from confidence to doubt. he notes, markets continue to price in a possible left tail, with the sp 500 hovering at the -10 correction threshold. timmer distinguishes between sharp, swift drawdowns, like the 1998 ltcm crisis, and potential recession-driven corrections. market cycles that are priced for recessions that dont happen are the ones we want to rebalance into. however, he cautions that if fiscal austerity and trade tensions trigger a recession, we are likely not done correcting. the core-pce inflation rate near 3 further complicates matters, potentially limiting the feds support. while acknowledging the difficulty of predicting market movements in real time, he emphasizes the importance of analyzing the tape, sentiment, valuation, earnings estimates, and credit. while the market appears moderately oversold and sentiment is cautious, it doesnt indicate recessionary pricing, warranting further patience. regarding diversification, timmer points to the performance of international equities, treasuries, and gold. he also poses the crucial question whether the rotation out of the mag 7 is a bump along the road to continued ai and mega cap dominance, or the big one. he stresses that if a new secular regime is emerging, the game going forward will be all about the alpha instead of the beta, necessitating a wider asset allocation and lower equity return expectations. timmer also notes the historical occurrence of 10 drawdowns, stating the odds of being in a 10 drawdown have been around 40 for the sp 500, and that there is no clear historical pattern of what happens after a 10 decline. he also notes a similarity between the current market and the 1998 ltcm crisis, both catalyzed by an unwinding of crowded trades. according to eugenia mykuliak, the founder and executive director at b2prime group, tariffs can cause a disruption in global supply chains, which will lead businesses to reassess their supply routes. a recalibration of the supply chain will lead to capital outflows from emerging markets and increased market volatility, said mykuliak. see also how to trade futures upcoming economic data heres what investors will keep an eye on wednesday marchs adp employment data will

  Title: How Trump tariffs led to a $2.5 trillion wipeout for the US stock markets – and why worse is yet to come
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-04 15:13:26)
  Content: tech giant apple lost more than 300bn in market value from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. unless you happen to be an investor or trader who had shorted a lot of stocks prior to this week, it probably hasnt been an enjoyable experience watching some of the biggest and most well-known companies on the planet tumble ever-deeper into the red. by the close of play in the us on thursday, president donald trumps previous-day announcement of global tariffs had wiped just shy of an estimated 2.5 trillion, or 1.9tn, off the total value of us stock markets in the space of a few hours. for what is essentially a play at making his nation richer for the long term, it was quite the impact in the opposite direction - but mr trump remains steadfast in his beliefs that a longer-term gain will be made from his ploy of alienating most of the rest of the planet in business terms. on thursday, the sp 500 fell a total 4.8 per cent - that equated to a total market value wipeout of 2.48tn, the financial times calculated. thats not the end of the tough-to-read numbers though, with the dow industrial index dropping almost four per cent and the nasdaq dropping very close to six per cent. the nasdaq 100 is notoriously tech focused, making it almost a proxy for how quickly or how far modern businesses progress and enrich their shareholders - or the countries they pay taxes to - and on thursday that particular index lost out to the tune of 1.4tn 1.08tn, bloomberg estimate. while its important to note thats not an additional trillion on top of the two already mentioned - theres overlap of companies across indices - its still indicative of the pressures that white house policy will come under if the bleeding isnt stemmed soon. chip-related companies fell almost ten per cent as a group. amazon lost almost 200bn 154bn in market capitalisation value alone. the vix index, also known as the fear index, has risen 60 per cent in under a week, highlighting the prospect of greater volatility ahead. and the sell-off is far from done as futures are showed in pre-trading on friday hours ahead of the new york stock exchange opening, amazon was signalling another 1.3 per cent drop, tesla one per cent, apple one per cent. by two hours into friday trading, the sp 500 was down another 3.5 per cent, with amazon down to the tune of two per cent, apple broaching a four per cent loss and tesla a full 8.67 per cent in the red. these are just big-name companies in the public consciousness but non-tech-related corporations havent been spared. disney? down nine per cent yesterday and more than three per cent by friday 4pm bst. oil giant exxon mobil? 5.2 per cent drop thursday, four per cent mid-friday. and nike took a 14 per cent hit on the thursday - but after an initial dip friday staged a mid-session recovery, four per cent up as perhaps some investors eyed up a price weakness opportunity. thursday was the biggest single-day drop since covid and it clearly isnt finished yet. of course, given the tariffs were placed on other countries, it doesnt mean this was an america-only issue. share prices were jumpy across the globe even before the announcement, given the uncertainty it created, but the scale of them meant big hits in asia, europe and the uk - the latter two at least partially mitigated by the fact the likes of the ftse 100 and the dax in germany had climbed well earlier in the year. the markets are going to boom. the stock is going to boom. the country is going to boom. and the rest of the world wants to see is there any way they can make a deal, cnbc report trump saying. perhaps thats the case - in fact, given decades of stock market history, its almost certainly the case. the more pertinent question is whether theyll do so on his watch, under these plans, or if some other catalyst for recovery is required. investors looking to buy on the dip were spoiled for choice given the sharp declines seen on the market this week. its now a question of when investors feel brave enough to go shopping. todays extended sell-off implies they are still too nervous to take the plunge, noted russ mould of aj bell. one additional company to note apple fell 9.25 per cent in total on thursday. the most valuable public listed company on the planet in market capitalisation terms lost out to the tune of 310bn 240bn or so. the reasons why are obviously multi-layered, but a big portion of the reason is the tariffs applied to countries where they receive parts and materials from, in particular china. they had initiated a move in production to nearby nations, including vietnam, but a 46 per cent tariff applies there too. clearly, maintaining business in the same way would make apple products prohibitively expensive, so the threat of lost sales impacts share price immediately. an analysis by wedbush analyst dan ives, reported by yahoo finance, suggested it would take apple three years and 30bn 23bn to switch just a tenth of its supply chain to the us from asia. the trump administration confirmed there was no carve-out to the rules for apple. the stock market is widely used as an indicator of economic health and business growth of course, but its not the only thing that matters - and unfortunately for the us, many of the other markers are pointing negatively right now. measured against the pound, the dollar is a lot weaker now then even a few weeks ago on 20 january 1 bought 1.21 1.2171 to be precise on thursday it topped 1.31 for a spell, before pulling back to around 1.2990. fawad razaqzada, market analyst at city index, pointed out the selling went beyond shares in corporate america. as indices remained rooted in the bottom and the us dollar suffered a broad-based slump, it is clear that market sentiment is fragile, and this might not be the end of the selling. even gold, often a safe haven, could not escape the selling pressure, reinforcing fears that rising tariffs could spell trouble across asset classes. indeed, crude oil was even lower, he said. higher inflation appears a near-certainty. us stagflation is now a real concern for some economists and jp morgan foresee a 60 per cent chance of global recession if the tariffs stick. and more pain of lost income for businesses could be seen in the coming months. during a wave of uncertainty, one thing is evidenttrumps policies and pronouncements have produced a negative sentiment shift toward the us among international travelers. the correlating decline in international travel to the us is expected to be strongest in 2025, with persisting degrees of impact throughout the remainder of trumps second term, explained a report - highlighting an expected fall of 9.4 per cent in international visitors to the states. in monetary terms, oxford economics expect that to translate to a further loss of 9bn 6.9bn in the remainder of 2025. trump may have a grand plan to return the states to a more balanced, self-sufficient and thriving economy, but it needs a lot of pieces to fall into place to be the case. the start of that process has been painful indeed, with no immediate end in sight. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Tesla stock pops after Trump comments on China tariffs and Powell, despite weak earnings - CNBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-23 14:19:16)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article implicitly touches upon the concept of 'Market Efficiency' (specifically, the semi-strong form) by detailing how new information—Tesla's earnings report and President Trump's statements on tariffs and the Fed—immediately impacts the stock price. The text states, "shares were initially flat postmarket, jumping on tariff optimism after president donald trump... signaled that duties on china will not be as high as 145". This rapid price adjustment based on public information aligns with the theory's prediction that stock prices reflect all publicly available information, suggesting that market participants quickly processed and reacted to these specific news items.; Theories_and_interpretations: The interplay between political statements and market movements, particularly regarding tariffs and the Federal Reserve, can be viewed through the lens of 'Political Economy'. The article highlights how President Trump's comments on "duties on china" and his stance on "firing federal reserve chair jerome powell" directly influenced "broader investor sentiment" and Tesla's stock price. This demonstrates how political decisions and rhetoric, often driven by non-economic motives, can have significant and immediate economic consequences, underscoring the interconnectedness of political power and market dynamics beyond purely economic fundamentals.; Intriguing_angles: The article notes that Tesla's shares jumped significantly after Elon Musk suggested he would spend *more* time at Tesla, immediately followed by a quote from the earnings call where he said he would spend *less* time at a 'department of government efficiency'. The text states, "tesla shares popped 7 after ceo elon musk suggested he will spend more time at the company" and later, "during the companys earnings call, musk also said he will spend significantly less time at the so-called department of government efficiency". This juxtaposition, without explicit clarification of the relationship between 'spending more time at Tesla' and 'spending less time at the government efficiency department', leaves the reader to infer the connection. Could the 'department of government efficiency' be a project Musk was involved in outside of Tesla, and reducing that commitment frees up time for Tesla? Or is the phrasing intended to link a reduction in external activity directly to increased focus on the core company? What specific activities or roles does the 'department of government efficiency' represent, and why is reducing time there presented as a positive for Tesla's stock?

  Content: tesla shares popped 7 after ceo elon musk suggested he will spend more time at the company and tariff optimism from the white house lifted broader investor sentiment. shares were initially flat postmarket, jumping on tariff optimism after president donald trump ahead of teslas earnings call signaled that duties on china will not be as high as 145 and said he has no intention of firing federal reserve chair jerome powell. the president had previously intensified pressure on the central bank chair, declining to rule out firing powell before the end of his term. the electric vehicle maker reported lackluster first-quarter results, which included a 20 year-over-year drop in automotive revenue and a 71 decline in net income. tesla also said it would revisit 2025 guidance when it provides a second-quarter update. top- and bottom-line figures also fell short of estimates, with the company posting adjusted earnings of 27 cents per share on revenue of 19.34 billion. analysts projected adjusted earnings per share of 39 cents on 21.11 billion in revenue. during the companys earnings call, musk also said he will spend significantly less time at the so-called department of government efficiency starting next month. the jump in shares comes on the heels of an oversold stretch for tesla, with shares down about 40 since the start of 2025. trade war fears and market volatility have further added to the losses. tesla also reported its worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period ending in march. piper sandler called the report the best result that tsla bulls couldve reasonably hoped for, adding that management said enough to keep the dream alive. while questions linger, the report helped ease some concerns, the firm said. meanwhile, goldman sachs analyst mark delaney said he expects higher software revenue from teslas full self-driving longer term can counteract some medium-term headwinds. the firm, however, kept its neutral rating and cut its price target on the stock. but the report was not enough to sway some wall street bears, with ubs and wells fargo retaining their sell and underweight ratings. wells fargo analyst colin langan trimmed the firms price target to 120 from 130. sentiment may drive the stock temporarily higher into a june robo-taxi launch, but we believe this may be a sell the news event for some investors. the potential catalyst of the low-cost vehicle launch may be removed as well, ubs said. got a confidential news tip? we want to hear from you. sign up for free newsletters and get more cnbc delivered to your inbox get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services. 2025 cnbc llc. . a division of nbcuniversal data is a real-time snapshot data is delayed at least 15 minutes. global business and financial news, stock quotes, and market data and analysis.

  Title: IMF slashes 2025 U.S. growth forecast to 1.8% from 2.7%, citing trade tensions - CNBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 13:00:13)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Supply Shock Economics: The article explicitly states, "tariffs are a negative supply shock for the economy imposing them." This aligns with supply shock theory, where an external event (tariffs increasing import costs) directly constrains production or increases input prices, leading to reduced output (lower growth forecasts) and higher prices (increased inflation forecasts), as detailed for the U.S. and advanced economies. This framing emphasizes the direct, cost-push mechanism of tariffs on the economy.; Intriguing_angles: The article notes that the IMF's April 4 data cutoff for the forecast "excluding subsequent developments like the 90-day pause on higher rates and the exemption on smartphones." This specific exclusion, mentioned in passing, suggests the forecast might be based on a scenario that was already partially superseded by later policy adjustments. Could the forecast's severity be influenced by this specific data cutoff point, potentially not reflecting the full, evolving policy landscape?

  Content: tariffs are posing major headwinds for the u.s. and global economies, leading the international monetary fund to slash its 2025 growth forecast. president donald trumps april 2 rollout of reciprocal tariffs has not only shaken stocks the sp 500 is down 9 since the levies were launched but they also have set off countermeasures from other trading partners. this on its own is a major negative shock to growth, the imf said in the executive summary of its april 2025 world economic outlook. this new outlook includes a reference forecast for global economic growth and inflation, based on data available as of april 4 including the reciprocal tariffs but excluding subsequent developments like the 90-day pause on higher rates and the exemption on smartphones and updates the earlier outlook the imf shared in january. in its new projections, the imf now calls for a u.s. growth outlook of 1.8 in 2025, down 0.9 percentage point from its january forecast. in addition to trade policy pressures, the imfs chief economist, pierre-olivier gourinchas, added that the weakening consumer confidence and consumption indicators also factored in its downward revision. while it is not yet calling for a recession in the u.s., gourinchas told reporters tuesday that the imf now views recession odds at 40, up from 25 in october 2024. the imf also cut back its global growth forecast to 2.8 in 2025, down 0.5 percentage point from its previous estimate. the april 2 rose garden announcement forced us to jettison our projections nearly finalized at that point and compress a production cycle that usually takes more than two months into less than 10 days, gourinchas wrote in the april report. the common denominator . is that tariffs are a negative supply shock for the economy imposing them, he said. the imf also revised its expectations for headline inflation for advanced economies, which include the u.s., the united kingdom and canada, to 2.5 for 2025, reflecting an increase of 0.4 percentage point from januarys projection. the u.s. inflation outlook was also revised higher to 3, up 1 percentage point from the initial projection in january. for the united states, this reflects stubborn price dynamics in the services sector as well as a recent uptick in the growth of the price of core goods excluding food and energy and the supply shock from recent tariffs, the imf noted in its april report. the increase in inflation for major economies was offset by downward revisions across certain emerging markets and developing economies. the extent to which the levies pressure central banks efforts to lower inflation is contingent on whether the tariffs are perceived to be temporary or permanent, according to the imfs report. previous bouts of market volatility have led to the u.s. dollar strengthening relative to other countries, creating upward inflationary pressure in other countries. however, the dollar has reversed this trend amid the recent market sell-off. the effect of tariffs on exchange rates is not straightforward, per gourinchas. in the medium term, the dollar may depreciate in real terms if tariffs translate into lower productivity in the us tradables sector, relative to its trading partners. uncertain markets? gain an edge with cnbc pro live, an exclusive, inaugural event at the historic new york stock exchange. in todays dynamic financial landscape, access to expert insights is paramount. as a cnbc pro subscriber, we invite you to join us for our first exclusive, in-person cnbc pro live event at the iconic nyse on thursday, june 12. join interactive pro clinics led by our pros carter worth, dan niles, and dan ives, with a special edition of pro talks with tom lee. youll also get the opportunity to network with cnbc experts, talent and other pro subscribers during an exciting cocktail hour on the legendary trading floor. tickets are limited! got a confidential news tip? we want to hear from you. sign up for free newsletters and get more cnbc delivered to your inbox get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services. 2025 cnbc llc. . a division of nbcuniversal data is a real-time snapshot data is delayed at least 15 minutes. global business and financial news, stock quotes, and market data and analysis.

  Title: Stock market rout deepens as Dow plunges more than 2,200 points and Nasdaq enters bear market - CBS News
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-04 22:22:52)
  Content: updated on april 4, 2025 1159 pm edt cbs news financial markets ended a tumultuous week with a thud, as stocks tumbled for a second straight day on concerns about the economic fallout from new u.s. tariffs and the prospects of a global trade war. president trumps announcement of steep tariffs on wednesday shocked investors and sent economists scurrying to revise downward their forecasts for u.s. economic growth. federal reserve chair jerome powell also warned that the levies which include a 10 universal duty on all u.s. imports and reciprocal tariffs on nearly 90 countries are likely to dent the economy. while uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected, powell said in a speech friday in arlington, virginia. the same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth. the sp 500 fell 322 points, or nearly 6, to close at 5,074 the largest one-day slump in the broad-based index since march 16, 2020, when it lost 12. todays plunge erased 2.7 trillion in market value from the index. the decline wipes out more than a year of stock market gains, taking the sp 500 back to its levels in february 2024. the dow jones industrial average sank 2,231 points, or 5.5, and is down 14 since peaking in february. the nasdaq composite slid 963 points, or 5.8. that means the the tech-heavy index is now in a bear market, or when stocks drop at least 20 from their most recent high. tech stocks have flailed this week because of concerns that american tariffs on china along with countermeasures from beijing will hurt the high-tech sector, which has been key to driving corporate profits. the economic pain that will be brought by these tariffs is hard to describe and can essentially take the u.s. tech industry back a decade in the process while china steamrolls ahead, dan ives of wedbush securities said in a report. solita marcelli, chief investment officer americas at ubs global wealth management, told clients that the u.s. could tip into a recession later this year unless the u.s. moves to ease tariffs. in the near term, we believe the effective tariff rates could be higher still, and without president trump taking active steps to reduce tariffs over the next three to six months, we are likely to enter a downside scenario, including a meaningful u.s. recession and lower equity markets, he said in a research note. the free-fall amounts to the biggest two-day drop for the sp 500 and nasdaq since march 2020, when the pandemic began, and has wiped out trillions of dollars in investor wealth. drops of this magnitude arent unheard of on wall street, but theyre rare. over the last 25 years, the sp 500 has fallen 4 in a single day 38 times, according to adam turnquist, chief technical strategist for brokerage firm lpl financial. overseas markets also slid friday. in overnight trading in asia, tokyos nikkei 225 dropped 2.8, while south koreas kospi sank 0.9. in european trading, germanys dax lost 2, frances cac 40 in paris dipped 1.6 and britains ftse 100 shed 1.7. economists have downgraded their outlook for u.s. economic growth this year as mr. trump piles tariffs on a growing list of countries, warning that the levies are likely to boost inflation. that could reduce consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nations economic activity, as well as crimp business investment. import taxes are largely borne by businesses, which typically pass on part or much of those added costs to consumers. as a result, americans could face higher prices for electronics, household appliances, cars, clothing, furniture, and food such as coffee and chocolate, according to economists. looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters, powell said friday. according to the tax foundation, a nonpartisan policy research firm, the trump administrations tariffs could cost u.s. households more than 1,900 this year. david lefkowitz, head of u.s. equities at ubs global wealth management, thinks u.s. trade officials will eventually lower tariff rates as they negotiate with their counterparts abroad. but that process is likely to take time, and the investment bank doesnt expect a speedy reversal in u.s. tariffs. as a result, ubs economists have lowered their forecast for u.s. economic growth this year to less than 1. investors are also nervously watching as the barrage of u.s. tariffs prompts retaliation from key trading partners. china on friday said it will impose a 34 tariff on imports of all u.s. products starting april 10. the chinese commerce ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries as well impose trade sanctions on 27 additional u.s. companies. this is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely, analysts with capital economics said in a research note. in more upbeat news for financial markets, u.s. employers added 228,000 jobs in march, far exceeding analyst forecasts. the nations unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2, versus 4.1 in february. yet while job growth was robust last month, experts say the governments latest hiring numbers dont reflect the impact of the trump administrations trade policies on the economy. for investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia, brian jacobsen, chief economist at annex wealth management, said of this weeks downdraft in stocks. the associated press contributed to this report. alain sherter is a senior managing editor with cbs news. he covers business, economics, money and workplace issues for cbs moneywatch. 2025 cbs interactive inc. .

    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include...").
