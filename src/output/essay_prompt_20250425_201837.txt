  Title: Tariff turmoil: How Tesla and other companies are dealing with the uncertainty of the trade war
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-23 22:23:02)
  Content: new york ap uncertainty over tariffs and an unpredictable trade war is weighing heavily on companies as they report their latest financial results and try to give investors financial forecasts. some tariffs remain in place against key u.s. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. the tariff and trade picture has been shifting for months, sometimes changing drastically on a daily basis. those shifts make it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales. on tuesday, treasury secretary scott bessent said he expects a de-escalation in the trade war between the u.s. and china, but cautioned that talks between the two sides had yet to formally start. heres how several big companies are dealing with the tariff confusion tesla tesla is in a better position than most car companies to deal with tariffs because it makes most of its u.s. cars domestically. but it still sources materials from other nations and will face import taxes. the bigger impact will be seen in the companys energy business. the company said the impact will be outsized because it sources lfp battery cells from china. the broader trade war could also hurt the company as china, the worlds largest electric vehicle market, retaliates against the u.s. tesla was forced earlier this month to stop taking orders from mainland customers for two models, its model s and model x. it makes the model y and model 3 for the chinese market at its factory in shanghai. ceo elon musk, an adviser to president donald trump, on tuesday reiterated that he believes lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity. but he added that ultimately the president decides on what tariffs to impose. akzo nobel the amsterdam-based maker of paints and coatings for industrial and commercial use said the big risk from tariffs could come in the form of lower demand for its products. the company said almost all sales of finished goods in the u.s. were locally produced, with the majority of raw materials locally sourced. over the years, we deliberately localized both our procurement and production in the u.s., said ceo gregoire poux-guillaume, in a conference call with analysts. we also largely run china for china and use the rest of asia instead as an export base. the companys products range from paints and coatings for the automotive industry to the do-it-yourself homeowner. broader tariffs could squeeze consumers and businesses and hurt sales. boston scientific the medical device maker said it expects most of the effecs of tariffs to hit the company during the second half of the year, but that it can absorb the impact. the company raised its earnings and revenue forecasts for the year, despite the tariffs. it estimates a 200 million impact from tariffs in 2025, but said it can offset that through higher sales and reductions in discretionary spending. the company said it has a long-standing supply chain around the globe and has made significant investments in the u.s. boeing boeing said much of its supply chain is in the u.s. and many of its imports from canada and mexico are exempt from tariffs under an existing trade agreement. the company does have suppliers in japan and italy, but it expects to recover those tariff costs. the net annual cost of higher tariffs on the supply chain is less than 500 million. a bigger concern is the potential for retaliatory tariffs, which could impact its ability to deliver aircraft. china, a key target for u.s. tariffs, has retaliated in part by no longer accepting deliveries of boeing aircraft. att att, like its peers in the telecommunications sector, faces higher costs for cellphones and other equipment. the company said it believes it can manage anticipated higher costs, based on the current pause in some tariffs and its supply chain. the magnitude of any increase will depend on a variety of factors, including how much of the tariffs the vendors pass on, the impact that the tariffs have on consumer and business demand, said ceo john stankey, on a conference call with analysts.

  Title: Wall Street reacts to Trump's reciprocal tariffs
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 21:53:25)
  Content: reuters -president donald trump said on wednesday he would impose a 10 baseline tariff on all imports to the united states and higher duties on some of the countrys biggest trading partners, a move that could escalate a trade war and upend the global economy. trading partners are expected to respond with countermeasures that could lead to dramatically higher prices for everything from bicycles to wine. u.s. automakers are looking at steps they can take in the shorter term to mitigate tariffs, such as working with suppliers on any items that can be moved to the u.s. quickly without significant investment. but massive longer-term investment decisions require more time and certainty. the current u.s. automakers playbook is not enough, and they are facing a watershed moment. its an opportunity for automakers to do things differently. lean into emerging technology like ai across their business. explore and decide on alliances faster. speed up vehicle production cycle times. on the supply side, this watershed moment offers opportunity in the chaos for mergers and acquisitions. david mccall, president, united steelworkers usw international we must ensure our trade policy targets cheaters rather than trusted economic allies like canada. we should be working to build relationships - not barriers - with partners who have proven their commitment to joining us in tackling global overcapacity. the administration must also take steps to prevent companies from using tariffs as an excuse to price gouge consumers. nigel green, ceo, global financial advisory firm devere group this is how you sabotage the worlds economic engine while claiming to supercharge it. its a seismic day for global trade. trump is blowing up the post-war system that made the u.s. and the world more prosperous, and hes doing it with reckless confidence. tariffs are taxes - plain and simple - and american consumers will bear the brunt. the reality is stark, these tariffs will push prices higher on thousands of everyday goods - from phones to food - and that will fuel inflation at a time when it is already uncomfortably persistent. mike hawes, ceo, uks society of motor manufacturers and traders these tariff costs cannot be absorbed by manufacturers, thus hitting u.s. consumers who may face additional costs and a reduced choice of iconic british brands, whilst uk producers may have to review output in the face of constrained demand. seth goldstein, morningstar analyst on u.s. chemicals i see lower volumes as a result of tariffs. the tariffs will likely be passed along to raise price of end-market products to consumers. in turn, i expect we see consumers buy fewer goods. due to the high fixed-cost nature of chemicals production, lower volumes would have an outsized impact on profits, so we could see another year of declining profits if widespread tariffs are implemented. however, many chemical producers make their products in the u.s. to be sold domestically, so we see less of a direct impact. david french, executive vp of government relations at national retail federation more tariffs equal more anxiety and uncertainty for american businesses and consumers. tariffs are a tax paid by the u.s. importer that will be passed along to the end consumer. tariffs will not be paid by foreign countries or suppliers. we encourage president trump to hold trading partners accountable and restore fairness for american businesses without creating economic uncertainty and higher prices for american families. art wheaton, director of labor studies, ilr school, cornell university it will take years and billions of dollars to bring manufacturing jobs from new plants online, whereas expansions at existing factories could happen much sooner. however, companies prioritize stability - frequent policy changes can delay investment decisions as businesses wait for clearer, long-term signals before committing capital. michael ashley schulman, partner and cio at running point capital advisors possibly, trump in addition to bringing back manufacturing to the u.s. and leveraging our advanced robotics within our shores for that manufacturing renaissance, may also be trying to truly muck up the chinese economy and heighten their economic instability. 34 tariffs on chinese goods could either force many chinese manufacturers to close, increasing unemployment and social instability in china, andor force a temporary price level adjustment within the u.s. for chips, pcs, semiconductors and server manufacturers, these tariffs, if they hold, will be quite disruptive. investors, analysts, politicians, and the market will be on bated breath to see what is now negotiated between countries following this liberation day volley from the administration. hopefully, todays announcement is a worst case scenario, and any negotiations create improvements from here. with valuations skyrocketing in 2024, many investors are uneasy putting more money into stocks. unsure where to invest next?

  Title: Analysts Trim Target Prices for Tesla Stock, Citing Tariffs on Auto Industry
  Source: www.investopedia.com (2025-04-10 22:23:25)
  Content: key takeaways ubs and mizuho analysts lowered their targets for tesla on thursday, citing the potential of tariffs to weaken the broader auto industry. demand for electric vehicles is already soft, and sales may fall an additional 11 in 2025, according to ubs estimates. analysts also pared back their price expectations for general motors, rivian, and a number of auto suppliers. analysts lowered targets for tesla on thursday amid concerns that tariffs will weaken the broader auto industry. ubs cut its target price for tesla tsla to 190, estimating that the electric car manufacturers vehicle deliveries will fall 11 in 2025. mizuho analysts said tariffs will increase tesla prices and erode an already-weakening demand, lowering its target price to 375. a consensus analyst estimate puts tesla shares somewhere in the middle, at around 327, or nearly 30 above thursdays closing price, according to visible alpha. while lower estimates for 2025 are now more broadly expected, we believe the whole trajectory of earnings for tesla remains too high. ubs wrote in a note thursday, adding that shares will likely be volatile but downward sloping. tesla shares and the broader market have oscillated in recent days amid shifts in u.s. trade policy. ceo elon musks work slashing government spending has also influenced the car makers stock prices. shares finished down more than 7 on thursday but were still up more than 40 from a year earlier. although the trump administration scaled back tariffs this week on a number of u.s. trading partners, goods from china, including car batteries and their components, are subject to tariffs of more than 100. import taxes of 25 remain in effect on cars, which will drive up prices, deter consumers, and potentially reduce teslas 2025 u.s. revenue by 3.5, mizuho estimated. while a reduction in reciprocal tariffs helps reduce recessiondemand destruction risk, we point out that the auto tariffs are sector specific, not subject to individual country trade negotiations, ubs said. in our view, they are likely to remain for the foreseeable future. trade policies may usher in new era for auto industry sector-specific tariffs will likely add an average of 5,000 to car costs and depress domestic demand by 9, according to ubs analysts, who factored in the current 25 tariff on cars and the 25 import tax on parts slated to go into effect early next month. the trade policies may usher in a new era for the u.s. auto industry, ubs said. production disruptions are likely.and supply chains that were set up to be optimized over decades may need to be reimagined, said ubs. tariffs may also reduce general motors gm domestic annual revenue by 4 and rivian automotives rivn by 3.5, mizuho estimated. both mizuho and ubs lowered their price targets for gm and rivians stock, along with several auto suppliers. general motors fell 4, and rivian shares declined 2.6 on thursday.

  Content: reuters -u.s. president donald trump said on wednesday he would impose a 10 baseline tariff on all imports to the united states and higher duties on some of the countrys biggest trading partners, a move that could escalate a trade war and upend the global economy. here are latest reactions from company executives, trade and labour associations companies on holding weve taken note of the announced tariffs and are constantly monitoring the evolving situation and continuing policy changes. our global value and supply chain are well-positioned. germanys fresenius we . strongly support pharmaceuticals not being included in the reciprocal tariff proposal, as a blanket tariff would potentially risk shortages of essential medicines for american patients. steel group aperam regarding the limited volumes we export from the eu to the u.s., we will explore on a case by case basis the feasibility of relocating some of our production. unfortunately, the current lack of regulatory predictability creates an unfavorable business environment on both sides of the atlantic. stellantis the carmaker said it would temporarily pause production at some of its canadian and mexican assembly plants, such as its windsor assembly plant in canada. antonio baravalle, ceo, lavazza we had already planned to increase local production in the u.s. to 100. we are ready to go . but now there is this other element that is to be investigated, the duties for brasil . if they put a 10 duty on brazil, the duty of 20 is somehow already halved. the coffee maker currently produces around 50 of what it sells in the u.s. locally. ferrari purchase contracts for ferraris have clear and standard clauses allowing the company to adjust prices in case trade conditions change before the vehicles delivery. new tariffs will also apply to ferrari cars ordered months ago but not yet delivered to the u.s., a company spokesperson said. motofumi shitara, ceo, yamaha motor our exports would certainly be impacted. if these tariffs continue long-term, including for vehicles, we will need to respond by raising prices or reducing costs. maersk we generally expect customers to be a bit more cautious about their inventory levels. in the very short term, were likely to see some rush air freight orders in the u.s. ahead of the announced tariffs going into effect. it is also likely we will see an increase in demand for bonded storage as customers will want to hold off clearing goods while they get more certainty. gerresheimer the tariffs primarily affect our exports from our plant in mexico to the u.s. these include injection vials, for example . we will pass these customs duties on to our clients as additional costs. if necessary and if the customs duties are to remain in place in the longer term, we will also be able to relocate capacities. massimo battaini, ceo, prysmian on first reaction, the announcement appears to have a positive impact on local production. the tariffs will be applied to finished products, and therefore removes the risk that u.s. production could have been undercut from abroad. anders vindegg, head of media relations, hydro we are working actively both from norway and in the eu in brussels to inform and to work actively with the organisations and other measures that were a part of to leverage the importance of norwegian aluminium to europe. associations ipc, a global association for electronics manufacturing we welcome president trumps commitment to strengthening american manufacturing, particularly his focus on revitalizing the defense industrial base. tariffs will not achieve this goal.trade is essential to supply-chain resilience, innovation, and cost competitiveness. without it, tariffs risk raising costs for american businesses and further driving production offshore. retail industry leaders association the presidents plan is not a targeted attempt to protect american innovation or national security but will hit every familys budget. these newly announced tariffs and the expected retaliatory tariffs on american businesses risk destabilizing the u.s. economy, undermining the goals of bolstering domestic manufacturing and growth. european retail industry body eurocommerce eurocommerce calls on eu and u.s. administrations to engage in constructive dialogue. if negotiations fail, the eu has a legal basis to respond to unfair trading practices by third countries. with the anti-coercion instrument, the eu has an extensive toolbox which could help address the situation. international apparel federation the u.s. governments announcement of heavy taxes on its trade with the rest of the world is a major shock to our global apparel industry. it unnecessarily creates a new and often irrational reality affecting billions of dollars of investments and the lives of tens of millions of people working in our industry globally. ultimately, someone will have to pay the price. canadian steel association to reduce our dependency, the canadian steel industry urgently requires the adoption of strict border measures that address unfair steel trade in canada and helps to recapture the canadian market for our industry, our workers and our communities. spanish association of olive oil exporters the spanish olive oil sector is seriously disadvantaged by this 20, compared to 10 for other producing countries not belonging to the european union. 98 of olive oil consumed in the united states comes from imports, so these tariffs will result in a higher purchase price that will have to be borne by u.s. consumers. kevin craven, ceo, ads group, on aerospace components we are absolutely not clear whether that exemption from all tariffs on items that are classified as air worthy by regulators continues and whether these tariffs apply or not. so potentially that might make it more painful. eu farming group copa-cogeca the introduction of additional tariffs threatens to disrupt global supply chains, drive up prices, and limit market access for farmers and agri-cooperatives on both sides of the atlantic, with significant economic consequences for the agricultural sector. anthony brun, head of french cognac growers association ugvc one could have feared much higher tariffs, but this risk is not off the table and remains with a potential conflict over bourbon whiskey. we already face tariffs in china, now there are the u.s., and the consequences will be very brutal to wine growers. sigrid de vries, director general, european automobile manufacturers association we urge our leaders to meet urgently so that they can find a solution to any issues preventing free and fair trade between historic allies and allow the eu-us relationship to flourish once again. swiss business group economiesuisse a further escalation of the trade conflict must be prevented. the federal council and swiss economic diplomacy are called upon to quickly find solutions at the negotiating table with the u.s. government. from an economic perspective, there are no comprehensible reasons for u.s. tariffs against switzerland quite the opposite. dirk jandura, head of germanys exporters association bga we will have to pass these tariffs on as price increases, and that will hit turnover in many cases . this is an economic blind alley at whose end lie welfare losses for both sides of the atlantic. reporting by reuters bureax, compiled by mrinalika roy, greta rosen fondahn, linda pasquini and alessandro parodi editing by alan barona, milla nissi and bernadette baum 2025

  Title: 5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday - CNBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-23 11:57:53)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article illustrates elements of Behavioral Economics, specifically how non-economic factors like political rhetoric and perceived stability (Trump's statements on Powell's job security) can directly and immediately influence market sentiment and asset prices. The text states, "trump saying he has no plans to fire powell... restored some investor confidence in u.s. assets," directly linking a political statement to market behavior, suggesting that investor psychology, rather than just fundamental economic data, is a key driver in this context.; Theories_and_interpretations: The discussion of tariffs and their impact on companies like Tesla and Boeing reflects core concepts of Supply Chain Management and International Trade theory. The article notes tariffs "adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of tesla" and exposed "boeing to higher costs for imported parts and materials." This highlights how trade barriers create friction, increase costs, and necessitate adjustments within complex global production networks, impacting corporate profitability and operational decisions.; Intriguing_angles: The article notes that "even so, tesla shares rose after the report" despite reporting significant drops in revenue and net income and facing increased competition. This textual point is intriguing because it suggests that factors *other* than immediate financial performance metrics were driving investor behavior on this specific day. Could the broader market sentiment shift (relief about Powell's job security) have outweighed negative company fundamentals? Or were there unstated forward-looking aspects of Tesla's report or Musk's comments that the market prioritized?

  Content: here are the most important news items that investors need to start their trading day u.s. stocks were poised to climb for the second straight day, a respite for investors after weeks of declines in volatile trading. futures rose wednesday, a day after the sp 500, dow jones industrial average and nasdaq composite all jumped at least 2.5. stocks got a boost after president donald trump said he had no intention of ousting federal reserve chairman jerome powell. meanwhile, treasury secretary scott bessent told investors he expects a de-escalation in trade tensions with china in the very near future. trump later said tariffs on imports from china wont be anywhere near as high as the current 145, but wont be zero. follow live market updates. trump saying he has no plans to fire powell before his term ends next year restored some investor confidence in u.s. assets. it marks a reversal for the president, who in recent days called the central bank chief a major loser and said his termination cannot come fast enough. economists and investors have worried powells removal would cause market panic, as the fed operates independently of the white house and its unclear if trump even has the power to fire the fed chair. trump claimed that he never did plan to oust powell. tesla fell short of wall streets first-quarter expectations. total revenue dropped 9, while automotive revenue tumbled 20 for the period. meanwhile, teslas net income plunged 71 from the prior year. tesla shares have fallen more than 40 this year as the electric automaker faces increased competition from chinese rivals, boycotts over ceo elon musks massive role in the trump administration and concerns about how trumps tariffs will affect its supply chain and expenses. in its shareholder deck, tesla told investors that uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of tesla and our peers. it also noted that changing political sentiment could affect demand. even so, tesla shares rose after the report, as the broader market breathed a sigh of relief about powells job security and musk said the time he will spend working for trumps so-called department of government efficiency will drop significantly. boeing wants to boost production of its best-selling 737 max jets. the company plans to ask the federal aviation administration for approval to increase production to 42 a month from 38, a cap set after a january 2024 accident when a door plug blew off of a 737 max mid-flight. ceo kelly ortberg said boeing is preparing to ask for the manufacturing increase as the company reported that its losses narrowed and its aircraft deliveries picked up in the first quarter. we are moving in the right direction and making progress, ortberg said of the quarter. boeings results only included tariffs as of march 31, before trump ramped up trade conflicts around the globe and exposed boeing to higher costs for imported parts and materials. the trump administration wants to bring big changes to the world of snacks. the food and drug administration plans to phase out petroleum-based synthetic food dyes by the end of next year. the agency does not yet have a formal agreement with food companies on how they will get rid of the additives used in products like cereal, candy, chips and sports drinks. while the changes will affect companies including pepsico, general mills and wk kellogg, it is unclear now how expensive the tweaks will be to make, or whether dimming the colors of snacks will affect demand. cnbcs brian evans, kevin breuninger, eamon javers, lora kolodny, ari levy, leslie josephs, amelia lucas and annika kim constantino contributed to this report. got a confidential news tip? we want to hear from you. sign up for free newsletters and get more cnbc delivered to your inbox get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services. 2025 cnbc llc. . a division of nbcuniversal data is a real-time snapshot data is delayed at least 15 minutes. global business and financial news, stock quotes, and market data and analysis.

  Title: Why Buying The Dip on Apple Stock (AAPL) is a Bad Idea - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-10 15:00:12)
  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. with the tariff situation spiraling over the past few days, its been almost impossible to establish a clear stance in the stock markets. the extreme volatility has made every trade feel unpredictable, with positive and negative news about global equities swinging wildly in both directions. but amid all this chaos, apples aapl stock has erased its gains from the past twelve months. thats pretty unusual for a stock of apples size and stability. discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with top smart score stocks. filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using tipranks stock screener. no other company seems to be more in the crosshairs of this tariff storm than cupertinos finest. only about 5 of apples major suppliers are based in the u.s., which leaves it heavily reliant on overseas production and imports. with tariffs pushing up production costs almost overnight, some of apples core products could see prices double. this is a massive, unprecedented challenge that no analyst could have predicted at this scale. given the chaotic situation in the u.s. tech sector, apple is facing serious structural headwinds. for me, this doesnt feel like an overreaction, even though the stock is down nearly 30 this year. with the current state of tariffs, im rating apple as a sell. the long-term outlook is uncertain depending on how the tariffs are resolved, and theres a real chance the stock could drop even more. while trade tariffs can bring more revenue into government coffers over time, they also destroy economic value by reducing trade volumes, especially in the short to medium term. raising costs for foreign suppliers to do business with the u.s. might encourage them to set up factories in the u.s. but this pressure on suppliers doesnt automatically lead to that outcomeit depends on a range of factors. now, lets consider apple in this context. the company has 36 of its supplier facilities in southeast asia and india, 33 in mainland china, 10 in taiwan, 9 in japan, 5 in europe and the u.s., and just 1 in latin america. in other words, 95 of apples product manufacturing occurs overseas. currently, a third of apples suppliers are subject to a massive 104 tariff on goods from mainland china, not to mention the additional tariffs imposed on production in every other country where apple has manufacturing facilities. speaking of china, lets rewind to between 2018 and 2019 when the u.s.-china trade war was in full swing under the trump administration. at that time, apple was trying to find ways to reduce its reliance on china, where nearly half of its biggest suppliers were based. fast-forward more than five years, and 33 of apples suppliers are still in mainland china. in short, this shows how complex and time-consuming it iseven for a company as large and influential as appleto reshape its supply chain. the big question is whether apple can soften the tariff impact without hiking prices on its flagship products like the iphone, mac and airpods. for now, the near-term future for apples sales is bleak. in my opinion, apple cannot dodge the tariff bullet without taking a major hit to its business. apples supply chain is one of the most complex in the world, and the companys ability to distribute its suppliers globally is the only reason it can offer an iphone 16 for 799. now, imagine apple trying to shift its most prominent suppliers to the u.s. first, there are some huge problems. the biggest one is that unemployment in the u.s. is very low at 4.2, which means the country would need a complete overhaul of its labor market to accommodate this shift. the second issue is that, unlike countries like mexico and india, where manufacturing workers earn around 6,500 and 4,000 a year, the average wage in the u.s. is around 40,000. even dan ives, a long-time apple bull at wedbush, is concerned. although he maintains a positive outlook, he lowered his price target from 325 to 250. ives believes that if apple were to manufacture in the u.s., iphones could cost as much as 3,500. considering that iphones are the core of apples ecosystem, such a drastic price increase would severely impact iphone sales and the companys high-margin services business, which has been a significant growth driver in recent years. to better understand the trade wars potential impact on apples business, lets consider a hypothetical scenario where china negotiates to ease the impact of the export tariffs. suppose china backs down and agrees that iphones can be manufactured in the u.s. under the same terms. however, would china then ban using iphones and other apple products within the country? the answer is, quite possibly. if that were the case, it could lead to a significant loss for apple. on average, around 30 million to 35 million iphones are shipped to china annually, each selling for approximately 1,000. thats about 35 billion in potential lost sales for apple in the region. in fact, in fy 2024, greater china accounted for 67 billion in sales, making up 17 of apples total revenue for the year. this figure could decline substantially in the coming years. on a more optimistic note, as morgan stanleys bullish analyst erik woodring pointed out, theres some hope for apple in the way consumers buy iphones. most people around the world still purchase their iphones on installment plans. so, while a 15 to 20 price increase would likely hurt demand, the silver lining is that apple may be somewhat insulated from these challenges. with installment plans, consumers can spread out the price hikes over two or three years, making the higher costs more digestible. despite the tariff debacle, several analysts have lowered their price targets on apple stock, but only one has downgraded apple to a sell since the beginning of april. out of the 33 analysts covering the stock in the past three months, 17 have a buy rating, 12 rate the stock as hold, and four have a sell rating. the average price target is 242.61, which suggests a 36 upside potential from the current price. for long-term apple shareholders, the key to deciding when to sell or trim positions lies in structural changes that disrupt the companys investment thesisa rare scenario for a company of apples size. the ongoing trade war and the imposition of import tariffs, particularly those affecting china, could significantly impact apples long-term outlook if these tariffs remain in place. higher costs will probably lead to lower demand, especially for key products in apples ecosystem, which could delay the companys ai supercycle and even affect its services business. in other words, this is a game changer and not in winning way for aapl shareholders. given this scenario, and with the trump administration struggling to negotiate better terms with key countries in apples supply chain, i expect further losses ahead, with apple likely underperforming the broader market. disclaimer disclosurereport an issue

  Content: by damian j. troise, ap business writer new york ap uncertainty over tariffs and an unpredictable trade war is weighing heavily on companies as they report their latest financial results and try to give investors financial forecasts. some tariffs remain in place against key u.s. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. the tariff and trade picture has been shifting for months, sometimes changing drastically on a daily basis. those shifts make it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales. on tuesday, treasury secretary scott bessent said he expects a de-escalation in the trade war between the u.s. and china, but cautioned that talks between the two sides had yet to formally start. heres how several big companies are dealing with the tariff confusion tesla is in a better position than most car companies to deal with tariffs because it makes most of its u.s. cars domestically. but it still sources materials from other nations and will face import taxes. the bigger impact will be seen in the companys energy business. the company said the impact will be outsized because it sources lfp battery cells from china. the broader trade war could also hurt the company as china, the worlds largest electric vehicle market, retaliates against the u.s. tesla was forced earlier this month to stop taking orders from mainland customers for two models, its model s and model x. it makes the model y and model 3 for the chinese market at its factory in shanghai. ceo elon musk, an adviser to president donald trump, on tuesday reiterated that he believes lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity. but he added that ultimately the president decides on what tariffs to impose. the amsterdam-based maker of paints and coatings for industrial and commercial use said the big risk from tariffs could come in the form of lower demand for its products. the company said almost all sales of finished goods in the u.s. were locally produced, with the majority of raw materials locally sourced. over the years, we deliberately localized both our procurement and production in the u.s., said ceo gregoire poux-guillaume, in a conference call with analysts. we also largely run china for china and use the rest of asia instead as an export base. the companys products range from paints and coatings for the automotive industry to the do-it-yourself homeowner. broader tariffs could squeeze consumers and businesses and hurt sales. the medical device maker said it expects most of the effecs of tariffs to hit the company during the second half of the year, but that it can absorb the impact. the company raised its earnings and revenue forecasts for the year, despite the tariffs. it estimates a 200 million impact from tariffs in 2025, but said it can offset that through higher sales and reductions in discretionary spending. the company said it has a long-standing supply chain around the globe and has made significant investments in the u.s. boeing said much of its supply chain is in the u.s. and many of its imports from canada and mexico are exempt from tariffs under an existing trade agreement. the company does have suppliers in japan and italy, but it expects to recover those tariff costs. the net annual cost of higher tariffs on the supply chain is less than 500 million. a bigger concern is the potential for retaliatory tariffs, which could impact its ability to deliver aircraft. china, a key target for u.s. tariffs, has retaliated in part by no longer accepting deliveries of boeing aircraft. att, like its peers in the telecommunications sector, faces higher costs for cellphones and other equipment. the company said it believes it can manage anticipated higher costs, based on the current pause in some tariffs and its supply chain. the magnitude of any increase will depend on a variety of factors, including how much of the tariffs the vendors pass on, the impact that the tariffs have on consumer and business demand, said ceo john stankey, on a conference call with analysts.

  Content: detroit ap president donald trump hinted that he might temporarily relieve the auto industry from permanent tariffs he previously imposed on the business. the president didnt specify how long the potential pause would be or what it would entail, but the auto sector is awaiting how rules might change on 25 tariffs based on u.s. parts, if duties remain on assembled vehicles. experts have said short pauses arent likely to give carmakers enough of an opportunity to adjust their vast global supply chains, though parts exemptions would certainly bolster the industry amid trumps trade war whiplash. trump told reporters monday that automakers need a little bit of time because theyre going to make them here, but they need a little bit of time. so im talking about things like that, referring to relocating production from canada, mexico and elsewhere. the news drove global auto stocks up tuesday. matt blunt, president of the american automotive policy council, which represents domestic auto companies ford, general motors and stellantis, said in a statement there is increasing awareness that broad tariffs on parts could undermine our shared goal of building a thriving and growing american auto industry, and that many of these supply chain transitions will take time. trump first announced 25 automotive tariffs late march the tariffs for completed vehicles took effect on april 3, while the parts tariffs were set to start 30 days later. the one-month delay is intended to give the u.s. government time to work out rules to exempt the value of automotive parts that contains u.s.-made materials, which will not be subject to the tariffs, according to insights from law firm foley lardner, noting a carveout for parts certified under regional trade pact, the u.s.-mexico-canada agreement. the department of commerce is expected to determine a system to calculate non-u.s. content by may 3. at the same time, automakers are navigating steel and aluminum imports levies of at least 25 25 duties on all goods from canada and mexico 10 global tariffs and reciprocal tariffs around the world paused for 90 days, and both of which automotive is exempt from and tariffs on china at 145. autos drive america, which represents foreign automakers, said in a statement that hitting pause on auto tariffs would be a step in the right direction and would allow automakers to deliver more choices at better prices for consumers. tariffs raise costs across the board making it more expensive to build cars in america and harder for families to find the vehicle that fits their needs, the group added. a pause on auto parts allows automakers to continue production in the u.s. without disruption while a pause on finished vehicles allows automakers to sell vehicles and keep investing in u.s. plants and jobs. the united auto workers labor union did not respond to a request for comment. the on-again, off-again tariffs have already wrought havoc for any number of global sectors but especially the auto industry, which relies on a complex network of parts from around the world. despite his close proximity to trump through the so-called department of government efficiency, tesla ceo elon musk has strayed from the presidents views on tariffs. important to note that tesla is not unscathed here, musk himself posted on his social media platform x. the tariff impact on tesla is still significant. teslas sold in the u.s. have a great deal of parts supplied and vehicles assembled here, and the company claims it has the most american-made cars. varying trims of the tesla model y and 3 are at least 85 domestic content, according to an annual made in america auto index. for comparison, ford builds about 80 of the vehicles it sells in the u.s. domestically. the american and european car industries are severely affected by tariffs. on top of the 25 tariff imposed on vehicles, we are impacted by layer upon layer of additional compounding tariffs including those on aluminum, steel, and parts, stellantis chairman john elkann said in the companys annual general meeting tuesday, noting at the same time, the chinese auto markets potential for growth this year. but its not too late if the u.s. and europe take the necessary urgent actions to promote an orderly transition, elkann added. we are encouraged by what president trump indicated yesterday on tariffs for the car industry. though trump says his tariffs are intended to bolster u.s. auto manufacturing, automakers arent able to reconfigure their sourcing in short periods of time, experts say. because of the nature of the business and the length of time it takes to design product and get manufacturing up and running, it could take years to reevaluate sources of supply and establish new assembly operations. flipping upside down a global supply chain that has been in place for decades cannot happen overnight for the auto industry, wedbush securities analyst dan ives said in a research note, and we strongly believe the clear right move would be to focus on finished cars made in the u.s. versus auto parts. the tariffs as they currently stand are sure to cost automakers billions of dollars, impact new and used vehicle supply and raise prices for car buyers at dealerships by thousands of dollars. already, some auto manufacturers have paused operations in canada and mexico and temporarily laid off workers in the u.s. some have also attempted to get ahead of the impact of tariffs through appeals to customers. in rare moves, ford and jeep-maker stellantis began offering employee pricing programs for a limited time to reach buyers before what will most likely be steep price hikes. hyundai and genesis vowed to hold prices steady for the coming two months. car buyers might be better positioned for an extra few weeks, depending on the latest policy change. a tariff exemption for the auto industry would be welcome relief to automakers and shoppers, said joseph yoon, consumer insights analyst at car buying firm edmunds. but as tariff policy fluctuates, it is difficult to know if exemptions will happen. the best course of action for consumers actively shopping for their next car is to seek out any incentive programs or protected pricing programs while they are available, yoon said. if your purchase timeline is a little further in the horizon, it may be prudent to await further clarification on tariff details and outcomes of potential exemptions instead of rushing into a purchase you may later regret. ___ the associated press climate and

  Title: Trump's tariff 'medicine' injects turmoil into global markets
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-07 03:49:43)
  Content: washingtonbrussels reuters -a global trade war touched off by u.s. president donald trumps sweeping tariffs escalated further on monday, as trump threatened to increase duties on china and the european union proposed counter-tariffs of its own. financial markets across the globe posted a third day of losses as investors worried that steep trade barriers around the worlds largest consumer market could lead to a recession. the sp 500 closed lower after a rollercoaster session in which it touched its lowest level in more than a year. trump said the tariffs - a minimum of 10 for all u.s. imports, with targeted rates of up to 50 - would help the united states recapture an industrial base that he says has withered over decades of trade liberalization. its the only chance our country will have to reset the table. because no other president would be willing to do what im doing, or to even go through it, he told reporters at the white house. now, i dont mind going through it because i see a beautiful picture at the end. trump spoke hours after he ratcheted up a confrontation with china, the worlds no. 2 economy. trump said he would impose an additional 50 duty on u.s. imports from china on wednesday if it did not withdraw the 34 tariffs it had imposed on u.s. products last week. those chinese tariffs had come in response to 34 reciprocal duties announced by trump. beijing responded with defiance. trumps threat was a typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying, chinese embassy spokesperson liu pengyu said. we have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening china is not a right way to engage with us, he added. china will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests. the european commission, meanwhile, proposed counter-tariffs of 25 on a range of u.s. goods, including soybeans, nuts and sausages, though other potential items like bourbon whiskey were left off the list, according to a document seen by reuters. officials said they stood ready to negotiate a zero for zero deal with trumps administration. sooner or later, we will sit at the negotiation table with the u.s. and find a mutually acceptable compromise, eu trade commissioner maros sefcovic said at a news conference. the 27-member bloc is struggling with tariffs on autos and metals already in place, and faces a 20 tariff on other products on wednesday. trump has also threatened to slap tariffs on eu alcoholic drinks. u.s. treasury secretary scott bessent met with trump in florida on sunday, politico reported, to urge him to emphasize striking trade deals with partners in order to reassure the markets that there is an endgame to the u.s. strategy. trump said his administration would open trade talks with japan, one of washingtons closest allies in asia, and administration officials say dozens of other countries have reached out as well with the hope of heading off the tariffs as high as 50 due to take effect on wednesday. the back-and-forth injected further turbulence into global financial markets, which have fallen steadily since trumps announcement. trump administration officials say the president is following through on a promise to reverse decades of trade liberalization that he believes has undercut the u.s. economy. hes doubling down on something that he knows works, and hes going to continue to do that, white house economist kevin hassett said on fox news. but he is also going to listen to our trading partners, and if they come to us with really great deals that advantage american manufacturing and american farmers, im sure hell listen. chinas retaliatory levies are the firmest response yet to trumps announcement, which has been met with bewildered condemnation from other leaders. after stocks in mainland china and hong kong cratered on monday, chinas sovereign fund stepped in to try to stabilise the market. shares in taiwan plummeted almost 10 - the biggest one-day percentage fall on record. wall street leaders issued warnings on u.s. tariffs, with jpmorgan chase nysejpm ceo jamie dimon saying they could have lasting negative consequences, while fund manager bill ackman said they could lead to an economic nuclear winter. ackman is one of a handful of trump supporters who questioned the strategy. billionaire elon musk, who is leading trumps effort to slash government spending, called for zero tariffs between the u.s. and europe over the weekend. on monday, trump trade adviser peter navarro dismissed the tesla nasdaqtsla ceo as a car assembler. investors and political leaders have struggled to determine whether trumps tariffs are permanent or a pressure tactic to win concessions from other countries. some in the eu worry that a forceful response risks even more blowback on european exporters of everything from french cognac and italian wine to german cars. volkswagen etrvowg_ps audi is holding back cars that arrived in u.s. ports after april 2 because of the newly imposed 25 auto tariff. aircraft parts supplier howmet aerospace may halt some shipments if they are impacted by tariffs, according to a letter seen by reuters. some governments in asia have signalled a willingness to engage. taiwanese president lai ching-te on sunday offered zero tariffs as the basis for talks, while an indian government official said delhi does not plan to retaliate. investors are now betting that the growing risk of recession could prompt the u.s. federal reserve to cut rates as early as next month. trump repeated his call for the central bank to lower rates on monday, but fed chief jerome powell has so far indicated he is in no rush. with valuations skyrocketing in 2024, many investors are uneasy putting more money into stocks. sure, there are always opportunities in the stock market but finding them feels more difficult now than a year ago. unsure where to invest next? one of the best ways to discover new high-potential opportunities is to look at the top performing portfolios this year. propicks ai offers 6 model portfolios from investing.com which identify the best stocks for investors to buy right now. for example, propicks ai found 9 overlooked stocks that jumped over 25 this year alone. the new stocks that made the monthly cut could yield enormous returns in the coming years. is jpm one of them? by signing up you agree to our terms conditions and

  Title: Tariff turmoil: How Tesla and other companies are dealing with the uncertainty of the trade war
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-23 18:00:42)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article illustrates Realism through the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. The text states, 'the broader trade war could also hurt the company as china, the worlds largest electric vehicle market, retaliates against the u.s.' This demonstrates states (U.S. and China) acting in their self-interest, using economic tools (tariffs) as weapons in a power struggle. This interpretation suggests that economic policies are not solely driven by economic factors but are also tools for geopolitical competition.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'some tariffs remain in place against key u.s. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate.' This postponement, without specifying which tariffs or partners, is intriguing. What specific conditions or concessions are being sought during these negotiations, and why are some partners prioritized over others? This raises questions about the underlying power dynamics and strategic considerations driving the U.S.'s trade policy.

  Title: Why Tesla may avoid the blow of Trump's auto tariffs
  Source: thehill.com (2025-04-02 10:00:00)
  Content: elon musks focus on american-made products at tesla could shield his company from the brunt of president trumps new tariffs on foreign vehicles and automobile parts. while foreign automakers and american consumers anticipate climbing car prices, the electric vehicle ev manufacturer led by musk may be safe from trumps 25 percent tariff because of its domestic production. tesla made a business model choice that has served them well, said simon ellis, who leads supply chain practices at idc manufacturing insights. they can argue more compellingly that their cars are really made in america. and in the current climate, that probably helps them, ellis added. trumps 25 percent tariff is set to go into effect on april 2 as part of the presidents broader trade war. he argued the tariffs will encourage foreign car manufacturers to move production into the u.s. and increase american jobs. tesla produces all of its north american vehicles in the u.s. at factories in california and texas, potentially lessening the impact for musk-led company, industry experts said. tesla is well positioned because they have vertical integration, said stephanie valdez streaty, cox automotives director of industry insights. they produce the vehicles they are building, the batteries. they can have more control over that supply chain, which helps them out. the tariffs are meant to force automakers to move production to the u.s., which could be a lengthy and expensive process. trump told meet the press in a sunday interview he was fine with americans paying higher prices for cars, so long as they were made in the u.s. i couldnt care less. i hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are going to buy american-made cars. we have plenty, trump said. tesla has a head start to this transition, observers said, given the manufacturing process already takes place in the u.s. it going to take a while for some of these other manufacturers that dont have anything. its going to take longer for them to retool the plants or shift production, valdez streaty said. so thats another advantage. teslas ev competitors are poised to be especially hard hit by trumps auto tariffs, maxwell shulman, a policy research analyst at beacon policy advisors, told the hill. evs already tend to be more expensive than their gasoline-powered alternatives and are reliant on battery and critical mineral supply chains that mostly run through china, shulman noted. any corresponding price increase makes them even less appealing to the average consumer, shulman said. and many companies are currently already losing money on every ev they make right now in the hopes that it might eventually be profitable. in a note to investors last week, deutsche bank analysts predicted tesla would be best off from the tariffs when compared to other major car manufacturers, including ford, honda, general motors gm, nissan, toyota and stellantis. analysts predicted gm could be the most impacted given its presence in mexico, while nissan and toyota could be materially impacted due to imports made in japan and mexico. still, tesla is not entirely immune, as some of its parts do not come from the united states. earlier this month, tesla acknowledged in a letter to u.s. trade representative jamieson greer that some vehicle parts are difficult or impossible to source in the u.s. at least 20 percent to 25 percent of tesla parts are imported from other countries, according to a document from the national highway traffic safety administration. another 60 percent to 75 percent are produced in the u.s. and canada. musk said last week tesla is not unscathed by the tariff impact, which is still significant for the company. wedbush securities analyst dan ives echoed this, stating the tariffs still present a headwind for tesla. tesla is getting hit less than other automakers when it comes to the tariffs, but i see no way that they wouldnt have to increase prices if the tariff stays in its current form, ives told the hill. trumps tariff could add, on average, 4,711 to the cost of buying a vehicle, according to a report from prominent economist arthur laffer last week. trump has wielded tariffs aggressively in his second term in office, levying import taxes on americas largest trading partners. after imposing 25 percent tariffs on all products imported from both canada and mexico, trump announced a one-month delay on auto parts and other products covered by a north american trade agreement he signed in his first term. the extension is set to expire on april 2, the same day that trump plans to unveil sweeping reciprocal tariffs on countries with duties on u.s. goods, which the president has labeled liberation day. tesla is also vulnerable to retaliation from other countries. the company warned of this in its letter to greer earlier this month, stating u.s. exporters are inherently exposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to u.s. trade actions. shulman noted tesla doesnt have the same global footprint as other auto manufacturers, meaning it could be hit worse when other countries respond to u.s. tariffs. musks relationship with trump could also make his company a particular target for retaliatory actions. canada announced last week that it had barred tesla from the countrys rebate programs in response to trumps tariffs. nonetheless, teslas limited exposure to the auto tariffs may be a bright spot for the company, which has struggled in recent months as musk has taken on a controversial role in the trump administration leading the department of government efficiency doge. teslas stock has plummeted nearly 50 percent since late december, and the ev company has become a target for both peaceful protests and violent demonstrations, including vandalism, shootings and arson attacks. trump and his allies rallied around the struggling company in recent weeks, with the president vowing to buy one of musks cars and commerce secretary howard lutnick urging americans to buy tesla stock. some industry observers argued the lessened impact of trumps tariffs on tesla will still not be enough to make up for the challenges facing the company and its standing in the electric vehicle community. tesla is going through a brand crisis tornado because of musks doge influence, ives said, adding, i think the brand crisis tornado is much more of an impact than the net benefit from the tariffs in the u.s. ives described the moment as a tipping point for tesla as musk attempts to run both doge and tesla, along with his other companies, including spacex, the social platform x and artificial intelligence firm xai. while tesla has long been a dominant player in the ev space, the brands focus appears to be shifting more toward artificial intelligence ai and robotics. besides the cybertruck, tesla has not released a new ev model in the u.s. since 2020, when it launched the model y crossover suv. during the last couple earning calls, elon musk has definitely highlighted that they tesla are an ai robotics company, she said. they still sell cars, but in terms of a kind of priority is this robotaxi theyve been talking about launching. even so, some in the business world believe this could serve teslas advantage. i dont think of tesla as a car company. i think of them as a technology company, i think of them as an ai play, i think of them as a robotaxi provider, an autonomous driving provider and i think of them as an innovative company, paul marino, chief revenue officer at themes etfs, told the hill. if youre an investor in tesla at its valuation today, youre not really worried or investing in them based on their ability to sell cars only, marino said, adding later, theyre light years ahead of the other auto manufacturers from a standpoint of how they produce, how they manufacture, and then how theyre going to generate additional revenue.

  Title: Boeing Investors: Here's What the Latest Big News From Delta Air Lines Means for You
  Source: finance.yahoo.com (2025-04-19 18:38:55)
  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. delta air lines nyse dal was the first major company to report results since the tariff war kicked off in early april. what its management said had significant implications for the aerospace sector, particularly for boeing nyse ba. heres what happened and why it matters so much for boeing investors. where to invest 1,000 right now? our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. continue first, heres a brief recap of the key takeaways from deltas first-quarter earnings call revenue increased by 3.3 year over year, behind managements previous estimate for closer to 4 - a figure already lowered from guidance for 7-9 given on the fourth-quarter earnings call in january. the uncertainty around global growth created by tariff skirmishes hit deltas bookings in the first quarter, and management declined to update full-year guidance in response to current market conditions. management also announced it would reduce expected capacity growth in the second half in response to the slowdown and try to protect margins frankly, much of this was expected, as deltas management had already told investors of a tariff-induced slowdown in march, and the escalation in the trade conflict since then is unlikely to have caused optimism among investors. the numbers and lack of full-year guidance are one thing, but management said something else that should concern boeing investors. quoting delta ceo ed bastian on the earnings call, we will not be paying tariffs on any aircraft deliveries we take, and if you start to put a 20 incremental cost on top of an aircraft, it gets very difficult to make that math work. bastian is talking about airbus here its the only airplane manufacturer delta is expecting deliveries from this year. the implication is clear either airbus will have to at least share part of the tariff cost in this case, tariffs applied by the u.s. tariffs on european products, or theres a risk the order will be delayed or cancelled. while delta is responding to u.s.-imposed tariffs, the message to boeing is that non-u.s. airlines could take the same approach to any tariffs imposed by other countries and the e.u. on u.s. products sold in those countries. it gets worse. airbus and boeing are subject to increased costs due to tariffs, either directly from an increase in costs from products sourced from the u.s. and the e.u., or from an increase in suppliers costs due to tariffs. moreover, its important to put deltas management commentary in context. the tariffs are weakening end demand, and the company is cutting its capacity expansion plans as a result. as such, its much easier for the airline to justify canceling orders in response to tariff-induced cost increases. in any case, weakening end demand tends to significantly impact airline ticket pricing, given the industrys sensitivity to fluctuations in demand and supply. this fact has always made it a highly cyclical industry. as such, softer ticket prices and weaker earnings could pressure airlines ability to order airplanes, let alone their willingness to do so. an ongoing escalation in the trade conflict looks likely to result in a scenario in which boeings costs rise while demand weakens. this could undermine boeings ability to compete on cost with airbus. for example, boeing could end up paying significantly more for products sourced or with componentsmaterials from, say, the u.k. or china, because the e.u. hasnt imposed tariffs on those countries goods. bastians comments dont read well for airbus, and, by implication, for boeing. its clearly going to be a difficult period, but it may not be lasting. while the warning signs are there, its important to remember that the tariffs appear to be a precursor to trade deals that could result in more favorable conditions for u.s. exporters. furthermore, stocks have already priced in a less favorable outlook for earnings this year. as such, boeing is definitely a stock to avoid if you are worried about escalating trade wars, but also a stock to buy if you are confident deals will be done. before you buy stock in boeing, consider this the motley fool stock advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now and boeing wasnt one of them. the 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years. consider when netflix made this list on december 17, 2004. if you invested 1,000 at the time of our recommendation, youd have 524,747! or when nvidia made this list on april 15, 2005. if you invested 1,000 at the time of our recommendation, youd have 622,041! now, its worth noting stock advisors total average return is 792 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 153 for the sp 500. dont miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join stock advisor. stock advisor returns as of april 14, 2025 lee samaha has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. the motley fool recommends delta air lines. the motley fool has a disclosure policy. boeing investors heres what the latest big news from delta air lines means for you was originally published by the motley fool

  Title: Dear Tesla Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for April 22
  Source: www.barchart.com (2025-04-21 16:17:33)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The article's discussion of Tesla's stock price relative to its earnings and growth rates, alongside mentions of how missed earnings estimates have driven share prices lower, aligns with principles of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). Specifically, the text states, "tsla stock is priced at 7.3x forward sales and 95.8x forward earnings, which is quite steep, given its slowing growth rates," and "tesla has missed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters, which has driven its share prices lower." This suggests the market is attempting to incorporate available information about performance and future prospects into the stock price, although the high multiples might indicate the pricing is heavily weighted towards future, potentially speculative, growth rather than current fundamentals, a point EMH acknowledges can occur with growth stocks or information asymmetry.; Theories_and_interpretations: The structure of the article, beginning with broad macroeconomic concerns like the 'trade war escalations' and 'upcoming earnings season' as drivers of market volatility before focusing extensively on a single company, Tesla, and its specific financial metrics and future plans, illustrates aspects of Agenda-Setting Theory. The text explicitly links these macro factors to market volatility: "equity markets in the u.s. are expected to remain volatile... given the trade war escalations... moreover, the upcoming earnings season is likely to drive volatility higher..." By dedicating significant space to Tesla's detailed forecasts, past performance, and future technological ambitions (FSD, Optimus), the article directs the reader's attention to these specific elements as central to understanding both the company's prospects and, by implication, a significant part of the market narrative, potentially influencing what readers perceive as important factors.; Intriguing_angles: The article presents a notable contrast between the highly ambitious, long-term revenue projections attributed to Elon Musk for future technologies like Optimus ("north of 10 trillion in revenue") and the relatively modest near-to-medium-term growth forecasts provided by analysts for Tesla's core business (e.g., 1.1% revenue growth forecast for Q1, 9.44% for 2025, 22.7% earnings growth over 5 years). Textual Basis: "musk predicted that the company could reach... potentially scale to 100,000 units thereafter, suggesting that optimus could eventually generate north of 10 trillion in revenue" vs. "revenue growth is forecast at 1.1 while earnings might decline by 6.7 year over year... for 2025, tesla is forecast to increase revenue by 9.44... earnings by 4 year over year." Significance: This highlights a potential divergence between the visionary, perhaps promotional, outlook from leadership and the more grounded, data-driven expectations from financial analysts. It raises questions about which perspective is primarily driving the stock's current high valuation. Probing Question: How much of Tesla's current valuation is based on the near-term analyst forecasts versus the highly speculative, long-term potential outlined by its CEO? What specific evidence within the article might help reconcile this apparent discrepancy in expectations?

here all information and data in this article is solely for informational purposes. for more information please view the barchart disclosure policy here equity markets in the u.s. are expected to remain volatile in the near term, given the trade war escalations with china and other countries. moreover, the upcoming earnings season is likely to drive volatility higher, especially if companies lower their outlooks due to macroeconomic headwinds and slowing consumer demand. the tariff war is expected to increase the cost of goods across multiple sectors, such as automobiles, which will drive down demand and potentially increase inflation. furthermore, if inflation rises, the federal reserve will be forced to raise interest rates, which will lower the discretionary income of households. its pretty evident that investors and analysts will be closely watching the earnings season to analyze the impact of tariffs on future growth. tesla tsla, the largest automobile company globally in terms of market capitalization, will report its q1 earnings on april 22. so, lets see what wall street expects from the auto giant in the march quarter. analysts tracking tesla expect the electric vehicle manufacturer to report revenue of 21.5 billion with adjusted earnings per share of 0.42 in the march quarter. it suggests that revenue growth is forecast at 1.1 while earnings might decline by 6.7 year over year. for 2025, tesla is forecast to increase revenue by 9.44 to 107 billion and earnings by 4 year over year to 2.52 per share. so, tsla stock is priced at 7.3x forward sales and 95.8x forward earnings, which is quite steep, given its slowing growth rates. notably, tesla has missed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters, which has driven its share prices lower. the ev maker has already missed vehicle delivery estimates in q1 and might issue disappointing guidance for the rest of 2025 as it grapples with rising competition and slowing demand. tesla capped off 2024 with record vehicle deliveries at an annualized rate of nearly 2 million units, with the model y becoming the best-selling vehicle of any kind globally last year. during teslas q4 earnings call, ceo elon musk outlined an ambitious vision for the companys future, predicting epic growth in 2026 and ridiculously good performance in 2027 and 2028, driven primarily by autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. tesla plans to launch unsupervised full self-driving fsd as a paid service in austin by june, with expansion to other u.s. cities by the end of the year. tesla is already operating autonomous vehicles with no human supervision at its fremont factory and plans to extend this to its texas facility soon. musk emphasized that several major automakers have expressed interest in licensing teslas full self-driving fsd technology, although the company wont entertain such discussions until unsupervised driving is working throughout the united states. on the robotics front, tesla aims to produce several thousand optimus humanoid robots this year for internal use at its factories. musk predicted that the company could reach a monthly production of 10,000 units next year and potentially scale to 100,000 units thereafter, suggesting that optimus could eventually generate north of 10 trillion in revenue. tesla also continues to invest in energy storage, with a second factory in shanghai set to start operations and a third facility in the works. the company expects at least 50 growth in deployments year-over-year in 2025. for 2025, tesla projects flat capital expenditures compared to 2024 and plans to introduce several new products, including a more affordable vehicle model in the first half of the year. despite its massive size, analysts expect tesla to grow its earnings by 22.7 annually over the next five years. compared to this, estimated adjusted earnings growth is much higher at 39. tesla is forecast to report adjusted earnings of 9.42 per share in 2029. so, if tsla stock is priced at 40 times forward earnings, it will trade around 375 per share in april 2029, indicating upside potential of over 50 from current levels. out of the 41 analysts covering tsla stock, 16 recommend strong buy, three recommend moderate buy, 12 recommend hold, and 10 recommend strong sell. the average target price for tsla stock is 304.83, which is 35 higher than the current price.

  Title: Stock market today: Wall Street falls in final hours of trading before Trump’s tariff announcement
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 13:57:35)
  Content: by stan choe, associated press business writer new york ap u.s. stocks are swinging again wednesday in the final hours before president donald trump unveils the tariffs he promised as part of his liberation day that could drastically remake the global economy and trade. the sp 500 was flat in morning trading after roaring back from an early loss of 1.1. its had a pattern this week of opening with sharp drops only to finish the day higher. the dow jones industrial average was up 28 points, or 0.1, after erasing an initial drop of 360 points. the nasdaq composite was 0.1 lower, as of 1035 a.m. eastern time. financial markets around the world have been particularly shaky lately because of all the uncertainty around what trump will announce in the event scheduled to begin after the u.s. stock market closes for the day. he has said he wants tariffs to make the global system more fair and to bring manufacturing jobs back to the united states from other countries. but tariffs also threaten to grind down growth for the u.s. and other economies around the world, while worsening inflation when it seems to be remaining stubbornly higher than the federal reserves 2 target. much is still unknown about what trump will say, including how big the tariffs will be, which countries will be hit and what kinds of products will be targeted. the announcement may also not even clear up all the uncertainty weighing on wall street, given that it may just provide a starting point for negotiations with other countries. one of the hopes thats helped push upward on the u.s. stock market recently is the possibility that at least the worst of the uncertainty may have already passed. we do not know how long the previously enacted tariffs and any future tariffs will remain in force, but we believe peak tariff uncertainty may soon be behind us, according to kurt reiman, head of fixed income americas, and other strategists at ubs global wealth management. much of the work the administration set out to achieve will have been put in place, and there are numerous potential offramps available. the tariffs trump will unveil later in the day will follow other announcements of 25 tariffs on auto imports levies against china, canada and mexico and expanded tariffs on steel and aluminum. trump has also put tariffs against countries that import oil from venezuela and plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips. another fear hitting the market is that the herky-jerky rollout of his trade strategy may itself create enough nervousness to spur u.s. households and businesses to freeze their spending, which would damage the economy. surveys have shown deepening pessimism, but economists are waiting to see if that translates into actual damage for the economy. a report on wednesday morning suggested the u.s. job market may still be running stronger than expected. the report from adp research said employers, excluding the government, accelerated their hiring last month by more than economists estimated. it could be an encouraging signal for the more comprehensive jobs report coming friday from the u.s. government. economists expect that to show overall hiring slowed in march from february. the job market has been one of the linchpins keeping the u.s. economy out of a recession. treasury yields nevertheless fell after the adp payrolls report, continuing a trend thats largely held since january on worries about how tariffs could slow the economy. the yield on the 10-year treasury fell to 4.14 from 4.17 late tuesday and from roughly 4.80 early this year. thats a significant move for the bond market. on wall street, tesla weighed on the market after it said it delivered fewer electric vehicles in the first three months of the year than it did in last years first quarter. its shares fell 3 to extend their loss for the year so far to 35.5. tesla, one of wall streets most influential stocks because of its immense size, has faced growing backlash due to anger about ceo elon musks leading the u.s. governments efforts to cut spending. newsmax fell 47.9 in its third day of trading to give back some of its meteoric gains from its debut. it surged 735 monday and then another 179 on tuesday. on the winning side were several airlines, which recovered some of the sharp losses theyve taken recently on worries that customers worried about tariffs and the global economy will fly less. united airlines climbed 1.4 to trim its loss for the week to 1.5 in stock market abroad, indexes fell across much of europe after finishing mixed in asia. ap business writers yuri kageyama and matt ott contributed.

  Title: Tesla stock rises after Musk says time at DOGE will drop 'significantly' - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-23 13:47:28)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article's structure and emphasis suggest a deliberate framing choice. Despite reporting significantly missed financial forecasts and declining sales/deliveries (core business metrics), the narrative prominently features Elon Musk's time allocation and political activities as key drivers for stock movement and brand perception. This highlights how media attention can prioritize personality and non-financial factors, potentially diverting focus from underlying economic performance issues, as suggested by the theory.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article implicitly touches upon International Political Economy by detailing how 'rapidly evolving trade policy' (tariffs) directly impacts Tesla's 'global supply chain and cost structure' and influences consumer purchasing decisions ('consumers pushed up purchases to avoid tariffs'). This illustrates how state actions (trade policy) significantly shape corporate strategy, operational costs, and market demand across borders, a central theme in IPE analysis.; Intriguing_angles: The article explicitly states that Musk's 'right-wing political activities' have caused Tesla's brand to 'take a hit' and contributed to 'falling sales'. This presents a direct causal link between a CEO's political stance and specific business outcomes (brand damage, sales decline). Why is this causal link presented so definitively without detailed evidence of the mechanism or scale of impact?; Intriguing_angles: The article notes Tesla's stock rose 3% on news of Musk spending more time at Tesla, despite simultaneously reporting a 'challenging quarter' with results 'far below wall street forecasts' and the 'worst quarter for deliveries since the second quarter of 2022'. This juxtaposition is striking. How does the market's reaction to a CEO's time commitment outweigh significantly negative financial results as presented in the same report?

      > Snippet: after ceo elon musk said he would spend more time at tesla and less time in washington, d.c.
  Content: tesla tsla stock rose 3 in early trade wednesday after ceo elon musk said he would spend more time at tesla and less time in washington, d.c., news that overshadowed a challenging quarter for the company that saw results come in far below wall street forecasts. starting early next month, in may, my time allocation to doge department of government efficiency will drop significantly, musk told investors on the companys earnings call. musk said hed continue to spend a day or two per week at doge, but said he will be allocating far more of my time to tesla. while we would have preferred a full re-engagement with tesla as opposed to still sharing time with political efforts, we nevertheless believe the narrative should benefit from a re-engaged elon on tesla simply, with tesla more heavily focused on avai, elon is more important than ever to keep this narrative moving forward . elon is tesla, barclays analyst dan levy wrote in a note to clients after the earnings call. tesla reported first quarter revenue of 19.34 billion, below the 21.43 billion wall street was forecasting and the 21.3 billion reported a year ago, according to bloomberg estimates. tesla posted adjusted earnings per share of 0.27, missing the 0.44 forecast by analysts. adjusted profits in the quarter fell 40 from a year ago. read more about teslas stock moves and wednesdays market action. tesla said plans for new affordable vehicles are on track for start of production in the first half of 2025 and that it still expects robotaxi volume production starting in 2026. along with robotaxi testing, these were two big investor concerns heading into earnings. the company blamed trade uncertainty as a reason behind slumping sales. uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of tesla and our peers, the company said in a statement. this dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term. musk said on the call that he told trump that lower tariffs were better for the country but ultimately the decision on tariffs is up to the president. because of this uncertainty, tesla said it would revisit its 2025 guidance in its second quarter financial update and removed its long-term growth forecast. read more what trumps tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet the key trade headwinds are 1 energy business is disproportionally affected by tariffs as tsla sources the lfp batteries from china, 2 volume guidance was temporarily paused due to tariff uncertainty, 3 china restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are employed in permanent magnets for electric motors, may negatively affect teslas business 4 a relevant portion of manufacturing equipment is sourced from china, bofa analyst john murphy noted in a research report. tesla said its first quarter gross margin hit 16.3, better than the 16.1 expected, with automotive gross margin ex-regulatory credits coming in at 12.5. in the past, tesla had promised to launch a lower-priced electric vehicle in the first half of 2025, along with other new vehicles that the company said would allow it to return to a 50 growth rate compared to 2023. reuters reported on friday that teslas plans to launch an affordable ev, which include a stripped-down version of the model y, have been delayed until later this year. tesla has not responded to that report. tesla execs on the call did not deny the reuters report, saying only that the company was focusing on affordability and these efforts would resemble some of the existing tesla models. the big concern for teslas bread-and-butter auto business is demand. earlier this month, tesla reported first quarter deliveries of 336,681 units making it the worst quarter for deliveries since the second quarter of 2022. conversely, rival automakers were seeing huge sales gains as consumers pushed up purchases to avoid tariffs, which began on april 2. teslas main rival overseas, byd byddy, has been eating into teslas market share for some time now. and president trumps auto sector tariffs of 25 on foreign imports have automakers like tesla in a bind. read more the latest news and updates on trumps tariffs demand concerns led to falling sales across a number of key regions for tesla. tesla registration data in key european regions fell in march, another sign that sales are continuing to slide as teslas brand has also taken a hit due to the right-wing political activities of ceo elon musk. musks closeness to president trump and embrace of right-wing politicians in europe have seen musks and teslas brands suffer. protests at tesla showrooms in the us and abroad are growing, as are acts of vandalism on tesla evs. musk added on the call that the company was focused on deploying robotaxi testing in austin in june, and claimed that teslas vehicles were significantly cheaper than waymos evs, which he said contained expensive sensor suites. pras subramanian is a reporter for yahoo finance. you can follow him on x and on instagram. for the latest
