  Title: Karen Read's second murder trial revives debate over who killed her Boston police officer boyfriend
  Source: abcnews.go.com (2025-04-22 00:14:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article highlights the prosecution's focus on 'drinking, driving, deadly consequences,' echoing a common public safety narrative. This suggests an attempt to frame the case in a way that resonates with pre-existing public concerns, potentially influencing jury perception and minimizing focus on the defense's conspiracy claims.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the defense was prevented from implicating Colin Albert in their opening statements. This is intriguing because it suggests a limitation on the defense's ability to present their full case. What is the justification for this limitation, and how might it impact the jury's perception of the defense's claims?

  Title: Is Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated (CORT) Among the Best Guru Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts?
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-23 17:17:07)
  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. we recently published a list of 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. in this article, we are going to take a look at where corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort stands against other guru stocks to invest in. wall street seems to be breathing a little easier after the initial panic over president trumps tariffs earlier this month, but the rollercoaster is not over just yet. all three major indexes closed last week in the red, with the dow and nasdaq both dipping over 2, and the broader market down more than 1. even though markets remain closed on april 18 for good friday, the general consensus is that the worst of the trade war headlines might be dying down. marko papic, chief strategist of geomacro strategy at bca research, remains cautiously optimistic, noting that while the idea of president trump striking 90 trade deals in 90 days sounds ambitious, they will likely be small, symbolic wins that still help calm markets. that said, volatility is expected to continue, and papic predicts the broader market could dip again before bouncing back, potentially giving investors a buying opportunity. investors are deep in earnings season right now, and some of wall streets biggest banks have reported solid first-quarter results. a big part of their success came from their trading desks, which cashed in on the recent market volatility, especially in equities. however, despite strong numbers on paper, bank ceos remain cautious and are hesitant to make big moves right now because of the market uncertainty. the us dollar also just had its worst weekly performance since 2022. meanwhile, investors are playing it safe and rapidly buying bonds, which pushed the 10-year treasury yield down to around 4.28. while some investors are seeing the current market dip as a buying opportunity, daniel von ahlen from globaldata ts lombard says otherwise. he believes the risks of a recession are being seriously underestimated. even though trumps recent tariff halt gave markets a bit of a boost, ahlen thinks that bounce will not last. in his view, this is not the time to scoop up stocks on the cheap, he is actually advising people to sell into rallies and avoid the usual buy-the-dip strategy. ahlen suggests getting a bit more cautious and selective. instead of jumping into the whole market, he recommends focusing on defensive sectors, like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare, that tend to hold up better in downturns. the market uncertainty is reflected in etfs as well, which are often considered wiser investment options due to active management strategies and lower risk compared to individual investing. for example, the guru etf is down 8.30 year-to-date as of april 18. however, over the last 12 months, the fund has posted share price returns of 13.38. similarly, five-year share returns stand at an impressive 51.57. guru gives retail investors a way to tap into the top stock picks of major hedge funds at a relatively low 0.75 expense ratio. it offers a more affordable and flexible way to try and beat the broader market using expert insights. so, lets take a look at the best guru stocks to buy. a biologist in a lab coat studying a culture of cells to find a cure for metabolic disorders. for this article, we looked up the guru etf, which had 82 holdings as of april 18. next, we manually searched for the average upside potential of each stock and selected 11 stocks with the highest values. the list below is ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of april 18. we have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment as of q4 2024. why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? the reason is simple our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. our quarterly newsletters strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4 since may 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points see more details here. number of hedge fund holders 29 average upside potential 117.48 corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort is an american biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for endocrine, oncologic, metabolic, and neurological conditions. their approved drug, korlym, helps manage high blood sugar in adults with cushings syndrome. cort is one of the best guru stocks to invest in, with an average upside potential of 117 as of april 18. on april 3, piper sandler raised the price target on corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort from 128 to 131 and maintained an overweight rating on the stock after strong phase iii results for relacorilant in treating platinum-resistant ovarian cancer proc. piper sandler sees proc as a billion-dollar market that could play a big role in corcepts future growth. the company plans to file for us approval in q3 2025, followed by a submission in the eu. corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort set records for both new korlym prescribers and patients in the fourth quarter of 2024. as awareness of hypercortisolism grows and more people are being screened, the company expects continued growth in its cushings syndrome business. revenue for the quarter reached 181.9 million, up from 135.4 million in q4 2023. total revenue for the year came in at 675 million, compared to 482.4 million last year. net income for the quarter was slightly lower at 30.7 million, but full-year net income increased to 141.2 million. corcept ended the year with 603.2 million in cash and investments and used 38 million for stock buybacks and employee stock options. according to insider monkeys q4 data, 29 hedge funds held long positions in corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort, up from 20 funds in the last quarter. jim simons renaissance technologies was the leading position holder in the company, with nearly 6.2 million shares worth 312.3 million. overall, cort ranks 5th among the 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. while we acknowledge the potential of cort as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that ai stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. there is an ai stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular ai stocks lost around 25. if you are looking for an ai stock that is more promising than cort but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest ai stock. read next 20 best ai stocks to buy now and 30 best stocks to buy now according to billionaires. disclosure none. this article is originally published at insider monkey.

  Title: Coca-Cola under fire after bombshell report exposes ties to controversial industry: 'The cost is irreversible damage to our children's health'
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-22 11:30:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying the concept of Externalities, the article highlights how the social costs of fracking and plastic production (environmental damage, health issues) are not fully borne by the companies involved (Coca-Cola, Unilever, etc.). The text states, 'the fracking process creates environmental damage and can significantly impact local communities' and mentions 'irreversible damage to our childrens health'. This suggests a market failure where the price of plastic does not reflect its true cost to society, leading to overproduction and consumption.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Coca-Cola's 'World Without Waste' initiative but then states 'its link to fracking operations suggests it is still looking to create new plastics.' This juxtaposition creates a contradiction. What are the specific mechanisms preventing Coca-Cola from fully transitioning to recycled plastics, and could these mechanisms be related to the profitability of fracking-derived plastics?

yeah, well, listen, that thats very good spinach what they serve. but you know, paul, to your point, you know, typically geopolitics sits well in the back seat of the car, if you will, and every once in a while, the driver, which is either interest rates or or corporate profits, who tends to sit shotgun, looks back and says, hey, pipe down. thats just not the case right now. we have this unfortunate series of events where we we obviously have the immediacy of tariffs, but we dont have the clarity on when well actually see tax reform, nor, as i mentioned earlier, when will we actually see more of an active dialogue across global officials. and so the initial salvo with respect to responses from macron, with responses to what we heard from china was, were not necessarily going to come immediately to the negotiation table. so what i think that means is theres probably some more spinach, if you will, being handed out by the by the passenger in the back seat to mix metaphors. but more importantly, what i think this challenges investors like us to think about is just, okay, where does that fundamental case ultimately kick in? what will consumers do? and wed already seen before the tariff announcements some bifurcation between higher income, middle income, and lower income consumers. and if anything, the risk is that gap widens and it widens more quickly. so some of the market reaction we think is that that time gap between moving from the the spinach course to the dessert course, but it also, i think, begs the question of when will we see a deterioration in consumer activity. were not going to learn a lot from the jobs data tomorrow. we will learn from what chair powell has to say with more of his forward views. but ill also just say this, this is actually not very well covered, but we had vice chair jefferson present today in atlanta. and again, very intelligent economist. he mentioned in the course of a 3,000 word presentation, this is the parsing that we do, he used the word tariff once in that entire presentation. so what i think that says is there may be a little bit of a of a hold off of a firm communication from the fed if were to use vice chair jeffersons guidance today. therell be a lot of focus on what we hear from chair powell tomorrow. reuters -institutional shareholder services has recommended pfizer investors reject a proposal on executive compensation at its upcoming annual meeting, citing concerns about certain changes made to long-term awards to its ceo and others. the modifications, including repeated changes to pfizers cash flow targets, and a lack of clarity about certain pipeline goals are concerning and undermine a pay-for-performance philosophy, iss said. annual incentives for executives are tied to achieving three financial goals, and payouts can be 30 percentage points higher or lower based on pipeline and esg-related goals achieved, iss said. cybersecurity stocks have not been immune from the recent market sell-off, opening up some attractive entry points for some of the top companies in the space. lets look at three cybersecurity stocks you might want to buy now and hold for the long term. while known for its next-generation firewalls, palo alto networks nasdaq panw has transformed itself into more of a complete cybersecurity company. buying high-quality dividend stocks is a great way to collect passive dividend income. the best ones increase their dividends each year, and they can help you more than offset the impact of inflation over the long run. federal realty investment trust nyse frt, nnn reit nyse nnn, and essex property trust nyse ess have elite records of growing their dividends. microsoft, alphabet, nvidia and amazon are part of the zacks top analyst blog. here are buffetts words on investing through a crisis. can you retire at 65 with 750,000 in a roth ira and 1,800 in monthly social security?

  Title: Karen Read’s second murder trial revives debate over who killed her Boston police officer boyfriend
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-22 16:36:55)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights the prosecution's focus on 'drinking, driving, deadly consequences,' which, as Michael Coyne states, has been 'drilled into us since middle school.' This suggests an attempt to leverage pre-existing societal narratives to frame the case in a way that resonates with jurors and influences public perception.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the defense is hampered by a pretrial ruling preventing them from implicating Colin Albert in their opening statements. This is intriguing because it suggests a potential bias or constraint on the defense's ability to present a full picture of the events. What other evidence might the defense be prevented from presenting, and how might this affect the jury's perception of the case?
  Key Entities Mentioned:
    - commonwealth:
      > Snippet: the commonwealth will focus on the theme drilled into us since middle school drinking, driving, deadly consequences, michael coyne, the dean of massachusetts school of law at andover, said in an email.
    - alan jackson:
      > Snippet: but defense attorney alan jackson began his opening statement by saying the prosecutions case was based on a brazen and flawed assertion that is untethered to the facts and the evidence.
    - hank brennan:
      > Snippet: brennan told jurors that facts and data will lead them to the truth, and that reads own statements will confirm it.
      > Snippet: brennan began his opening statement tuesday by describing the firefighter who raced to the scene in near-blizzard conditions and found read and two other women surrounding okeefes body on the ground.
      > Snippet: the biggest difference in the current trial is the lead prosecutor, hank brennan.
    - karen read:
      > Snippet: the murderer going to jail and karen being exonerated, that would be justice.
      > Snippet: read, who has been featured in several documentaries about her case, has become a minor celebrity.
      > Snippet: read is accused of striking her boyfriend, john okeefe, with her suv in 2022 and leaving him to die alone in the snow outside of a house party in canton
    - judge beverly cannone:
      > Snippet: the prosecution, however, stands to benefit from a pretrial ruling from judge beverly cannone that defense attorneys cant mention potential third-party culprits in their opening statements.
  Content: dedham, mass. ap the second murder trial of karen read, whose case has sparked a national debate on police accountability and won her legions of devoted fans, began with opening statements tuesday, more than three years after the death of her boston police officer boyfriend. read is accused of striking her boyfriend, john okeefe, with her suv in 2022 and leaving him to die alone in the snow outside of a house party in canton, a suburb about 20 miles 32 kilometers south of boston. she has been charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating a vehicle under the influence and leaving the scene. during the first trial last year, prosecutors said read intentionally backed into okeefe after she dropped him off at a house party and returned hours later to find him dead. the defense said that she was a victim of a vast police conspiracy and that okeefe was fatally beaten by another law enforcement officer at the party. a mistrial was declared last year after jurors said they were at an impasse and deliberating further would be futile. the biggest difference in the current trial is the lead prosecutor, hank brennan. brought in as a special prosecutor after the mistrial, the former defense attorney has represented a number of prominent clients, including notorious boston gangster james whitey bulger. brennan began his opening statement tuesday by describing the firefighter who raced to the scene in near-blizzard conditions and found read and two other women surrounding okeefes body on the ground. he stepped out into bedlam, he said. the firefighter then asked read what had happened, he said. youll hear her words, i hit him. i hit him. i hit him, brennan said. she admitted what she had done that night. brennan told jurors that facts and data will lead them to the truth, and that reads own statements will confirm it. but defense attorney alan jackson began his opening statement by saying the prosecutions case was based on a brazen and flawed assertion that is untethered to the facts and the evidence. john okeefe did not die from being hit by a vehicle, he said. the facts will show that. the evidence will show that. the data will show that. the science will show that and the experts will tell you that. many of the factors that made the first trial must-see television will feature in the second. most of the the same witnesses are back as are reads aggressive defense team and dozens of her supporters camped out near the courthouse many carrying free karen read signs and wearing pink. read, who has been featured in several documentaries about her case, has become a minor celebrity. a few dozen of reads supporters, many holding american flags, stood in front of the courthouse tuesday morning before moving a block away to comply with a court-ordered buffer zone. those who were reuniting hugged each other, while others took time to bring newcomers up to speed on the case. im here for justice, said ashlyn wade, a read supporter from canton. the murderer going to jail and karen being exonerated, that would be justice. the prosecution, however, stands to benefit from a pretrial ruling from judge beverly cannone that defense attorneys cant mention potential third-party culprits in their opening statements. they can develop a case against two law enforcement officers but cannot implicate alberts nephew, colin albert, as they did in the first trial. i view it as a blow to the defense strategy but not a knockout punch, daniel medwed, a law professor at northeastern university, said of the ruling. all the defense needs to do is create reasonable doubt about karen reads guilt, and that doesnt require pointing to an alternative perpetrator as a matter of law. legal experts expect prosecutors to focus on reads behavior as they did during the first trial her volatile relationship with okeefe and their night of heavy drinking. they also predict the prosecution will lay out a stronger and more coherent case that read clipped okeefe with the back of her suv and sent him tumbling to the ground using data from her car, video and stronger expert testimony. the commonwealth will focus on the theme drilled into us since middle school drinking, driving, deadly consequences, michael coyne, the dean of massachusetts school of law at andover, said in an email. the defense is expected to offer evidence that what they see as a sloppy police investigation was biased and that law enforcement officers set read up to protect the real killers. they could be helped by an audit of the canton police department released last month that found several mistakes with the investigation but no evidence of a cover-up. one of the key witnesses will be former state trooper michael proctor. he led the investigation but has since been fired after a disciplinary board found that he sent sexist and crude texts about read to his family and colleagues. michael proctor and his dismissal from the force may very well serve as the elephant in the courtroom throughout the proceedings, medwed said.

or she could dig her heels in and unleash an almighty blitzkrieg, castigating the french justice system with one hand and bringing down the government with the other. both options come with risks. bardella is still seen as green profile here. and so far, the french public seem pretty comfortable with mondays court ruling. an odoxa poll for le figaro published monday evening found that 54 percent of 995 respondents said they believed her sentence was a sign that france had a healthy democracy. another 65 percent said they were satisfied or indifferent to the verdict, victor goury-laffont reports. liberal unease yet even among liberal democrats, there was a sense of unease. sure, this is an affirmation of the rule of law le pen was convicted of misusing european parliament funds for campaign activities, after all. but its not a popular rejection by the demo. germanys spending push drives up borrowing costs across eurozone financial times welcome to britain, where critical whatsapp messages are a police matter reclaim the net the rise of the gurus sam freedman rachel reeves is a helpless pawn in donald trumps tariff war telegraph israel v. the resistance netanyahu cancels appointment of new shin bet head amid opposition from allies times of israel the first responders massacre 14 aid workers found dead and buried, hands bound mondoweiss guurst us blames hamas for israeli execution of palestinian medics antiwar.com kevin w. lordie. three killed in israeli strike targeting hezbollah militant in beirut arab news iran will target britains chagos base if trump attacks telegraph. the media and some readers argued that iran might not be able to reach diego garcia. iran is signaling otherwise. racist allied underestimation of russias abilities led to its win moon of alabama kevin w trump-putin parley is a bit under the weather indian punchline kevin w europe prepares itself for all-out war with russia ian proud germany decides to leave history in the past and prepare for war bbc trumps negotiators fail to understand russia and europe crashes and burns larry johnson big brother is watching you watch open source genetic database shuts down to protect users from authoritarian governments 404media. help me. the fact that police are the main users is a surprise?

  Title: Karen Read is back on trial for murder. Here’s what to know.
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-01 10:00:00)
  Content: a bitterly contested murder case is returning to court in massachusetts, reigniting a legal battle that has captivated true crime enthusiasts and placed a small-town police force under a microscope. karen read, 45, is set to stand trial again on charges that she struck and killed her boyfriend, boston police officer john okeefe, with her suv after a night of drinking on jan. 29, 2022. her first trial ended in a deadlocked jury last summer. the retrial is set to begin april 1 with jury selection. what happened the night of okeefes death? okeefe and read, a former equity analyst and adjunct professor at bentley college, had been drinking at various bars on the night of jan. 28, 2022, according to court records. just after midnight, read dropped off okeefe at a party in the canton, massachusetts, home of brian albert, another boston police officer. okeefe, 46, was found unresponsive outside alberts house by read at about 6 a.m. jan. 29 and later pronounced dead at a hospital. an autopsy determined he had died of a combination of hypothermia and blunt force trauma. prosecutors alleged that read, his girlfriend of two years, struck him with her suv while turning around after dropping him off. during the trial, they pointed to first responders called to the scene who claimed they heard her yell, i hit him. i hit him. oh my god. i hit him, as well as angry messages she allegedly sent okeefe before his death and vehicle data from the suv. the defense argued that okeefe was assaulted during a party inside alberts house and was left outside in a snowstorm with his injuries staged to suggest he was struck by a car. they said authorities failed to search the house for evidence of a struggle and highlighted potential conflicts of interest between investigators and other members and associates of law enforcement who were at the party that night. prosecutors rejected their claims. what happened during the first trial? read was charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating under the influence of alcohol, and leaving the scene of personal injury and death. more than 70 witnesses testified during the nine-week trial and jurors sifted through more than 600 pieces of evidence only to remain deadlocked, leading judge beverly cannone to declare a mistrial on july 1. two expert witnesses, brought in by the u.s. department of justice to review law enforcements handling of the case, testified that okeefes injuries and the physical evidence did not align with the prosecutions theory that reads suv struck him. the lead investigator, massachusetts state police trooper michael proctor, admitted on the witness stand to sending texts in which he mocked reads health condition, used crude insults to describe her and joked with colleagues about searching her phone for nude photos. in one message, he wrote that he wished she would kill herself. proctor said his comments had zero impact on the investigation. after the mistrial, massachusetts state police removed him from the detective unit. on march 19, the massachusetts state police trial board voted to dishonorably discharge proctor. he was found guilty of three charges of unsatisfactory performance and one charge of consuming alcohol while on duty. the family of okeefe filed a wrongful-death lawsuit last august against karen read as well as two canton bars the couple visited the night he died. a judge ordered a stay in the case to allow reads second criminal trial to proceed. what is expected to happen at the retrial? the theories put forward by the prosecution and defense dont normally change much after a mistrial but strategies do, according to michael cassidy, a criminal law professor at boston college law school and a former state and local prosecutor in massachusetts. cassidy said he expects prosecutors to pare down their case and call fewer witnesses. the defense will probably try to signal as strongly as possible to jurors that there was a previous trial jurors are not told they are at a retrial. the jurys awareness theres a retrial can help the defense, cassidy said they might think, someone else had reasonable doubt about this case, why shouldnt i? prosecutors might leverage the extensive media participation by read and other witnesses to their advantage, which gives prosecutors a broader pool of statements to draw from in an effort to catch inconsistencies in a sworn testimony. the more time a defendant talks to the media, that gives the prosecutors more instances to trip her up, cassidy said. cassidy said jury makeup will be a key change to watch. he suggested the defense will pursue younger jurors or those more open to ideas about conspiracies or government corruption, while prosecutors might want older, more conservative jurors who disapprove of reads alleged heavy drinking and fighting with her partner. how has the case captivated the public? true-crime fans, conspiracy theorists and cable news watchers were drawn to the case, thanks to the swirling narratives of a telegenic female murder suspect, a rocky romance and an alleged cover-up. the first trial was marked by dueling groups of demonstrators outside the courthouse. supporters of read gathered in pink shirts and held signs reading free karen read. groups of detractors held justice for john placards and chanted i hit him! i hit him! in reference to what read allegedly said after finding okeefes body.

  Title: Abu Dhabi Continues Building Big In Culture Push
  Source: finance.yahoo.com (2025-04-21 15:11:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Political Economy theory, the article demonstrates how direct political intervention, specifically President Trump's threats against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and pressure to cut rates, is presented as a primary driver of market instability. The text states the US dollar and treasuries are 'under pressure' and 'selling off' due to 'fallout from president trumps threats' and that risks to 'fed independence' put 'downward pressure on the confidence that foreign investors have'. This aligns with political economy perspectives where political actors' actions, even those targeting independent institutions, have immediate and tangible economic consequences, disrupting market confidence and asset values.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article heavily utilizes Agenda-Setting Theory by focusing on specific, curated topics and expert opinions presented as central to market movements. Phrases like 'stories driving the market action', 'stocks in focus this week', and repeated references to 'Jim Cramer's game plan' or lists like '12 AI stocks on wall streets radar' highlight how financial media and analysts select and emphasize certain narratives (political pressure on the Fed, specific tech stock performance, curated investment lists) to shape the perceived market agenda for investors. This suggests the article's structure is designed to direct reader attention to these specific points, potentially influencing their investment focus.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions 'uncertainty surrounding federal policy' contributing to businesses being 'priced for a significant slowdown... if not a recession'. However, it also notes that hopes for the 'new administrations pro-business approach swiftly gave way to tariff fears'. Textual Basis: These points appear in the paragraphs referencing investment letters from Heartland Advisors and Ariel Investments. Significance: The text presents both 'uncertainty' from federal policy and a 'pro-business approach' as factors, but then immediately links the 'pro-business approach' to 'tariff fears' that caused investors to 'fled to shelter'. This juxtaposition is intriguing because it suggests that the *specific nature* of the 'pro-business' policies (tariffs) was the source of the uncertainty and negative market reaction, potentially complicating or even contradicting a simple 'pro-business' label. Probing Question: How does the article reconcile the idea of a 'pro-business approach' with the simultaneous rise of 'tariff fears' and 'uncertainty surrounding federal policy' leading to recession pricing? Does the text imply certain 'pro-business' policies are inherently destabilizing for markets?

  Title: Karen Read heads to trial for the second time for allegedly murdering Boston cop boyfriend
  Source: nypost.com (2025-04-22 07:00:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article focuses heavily on the retrial and the prosecution's narrative, potentially influencing public perception. "Prosecutors claim that read mowed down okeefe...with her lexus suv...and then left him to die in a snowbank." This repeated framing could shape the audience's view of Read's guilt or innocence before all evidence is presented.; Theories_and_interpretations: Realism, typically applied to international relations, can be adapted to understand the power dynamics within the legal system. The mention of "a sprawling law enforcement cover-up" and the limitations placed on the defense's ability to present alternate suspects suggest a struggle for power and control over the narrative. The state, represented by the prosecution, seeks to maintain its authority and legitimacy.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that Read's case has garnered a "cult-like following" due to the defense theory and the livestreamed trial. However, it doesn't explore the reasons *why* this case has resonated so strongly with the public. What specific aspects of the case have captured the public's imagination, and what does this say about broader societal anxieties or beliefs?; Intriguing_angles: The article notes that the judge placed "new limitations on how far the defense could go in raising brian albert and higgins as alleged alternate suspects." This restriction seems significant, especially given the defense's claim of a law enforcement cover-up. What specific evidence was deemed insufficient, and what criteria were used to make that determination? Could these limitations potentially hinder the defense's ability to present a complete picture of the events?
  Key Entities Mentioned:
    - US Supreme Court:
      > Snippet: reads team also lost an emergency bid with the us supreme court to postpone her trial, claiming that trying her again on the two counts the jury allegedly intended to acquit her on amounted to double jeopardy.
    - boston police:
      > Snippet: during the first trial, reads lawyers were allowed to bring in evidence that they claimed helped prove she was a patsy for the crime that was allegedly carried out by boston police officer brian albert who owned the house where read dropped off okeefe alongside colin albert and atf agent brian higgins.
      > Snippet: prosecutors claim that read mowed down okeefe, 46, a 16-year veteran boston police officer, with her lexus suv when she dropped him off at his cop buddys house for a party in canton, mass., and then left him to die in a snowbank as a storm was rolling in that night.
      > Snippet: boston police officer john okeefe was killed in january 2022.
    - hank brennan:
      > Snippet: brennan has previously said he plans to try to streamline the new trial, in part by reducing the number of witnesses the prosecution will call on the second go-around.
      > Snippet: the retrial will be headed by a new prosecutor, hank brennan who notably defended notorious boston mob leader james whitey bulger.
    - karen read:
      > Snippet: read has also added new lawyers to her defense team, including victoria george, an alternate juror who didnt end up deliberating at her first trial.
      > Snippet: read, of mansfield, mass., has maintained her innocence in the case charging her with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death.
      > Snippet: karen read faces retrial in the case accusing her of killing her cop boyfriend john okeefe.
    - michael proctor:
      > Snippet: proctor, who was a state trooper and lead investigator in her case, was put on unpaid leave after the trial and was ultimately fired last month.
      > Snippet: the first trial was marked by drama including throngs of supporters who showed up to proclaim her innocence, and since-fired investigator michael proctor admitting on the witness stand to sending his friends and family inappropriate texts about read, including calling her a wack job ct.

  Title: Is Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) a Cheap NYSE Stock to Invest in According to Hedge Funds?
  Source: finance.yahoo.com (2025-04-14 14:48:19)
  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. we recently published a list of the 11 cheap nyse stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. in this article, we are going to take a look at where merck co. nysemrk stands against other cheap nyse stocks. on march 26, jack caffrey of jpmorgan asset management provided an analysis of market trends in a discussion on cnbcs squawk box. he emphasized diversified portfolios built around different exposures during periods of volatility. caffrey believes in the importance of time in the market over timing the market. he highlighted the difficulty in predicting when fear or euphoria will dominate, as some of the best market days follow extreme pessimism. caffrey also discussed the october sell-offs in 2022 and 2023, where many strategists expected further market tests at levels like 3200 or 3300 on the sp 500. however, instead of panic selling, the market experienced rebounds in 2023 and 2024. he observed that implied volatility reached the high 20s during recent corrections, but did not indicate widespread panic. caffrey also discussed how the mag7 drives market trends. while these stocks led growth in early 2020, their momentum eventually faded. this led to corrections instead of broadening. investors began exploring second and third derivative trades stemming from ai developments, such as increased electricity demand and improvements in natural gas markets. he noted that mean reversion often occurs when primary trades become well-understood and widely owned. he suggested that markets would likely be led by earnings rather than valuation. caffrey acknowledged that while some stocks within the mag7 have posted earnings growth that makes their valuations more reasonable, traders are increasingly seeking opportunities in overlooked sectors like energy and businesses benefiting from a weaker dollar. for instance, oil prices have remained down despite energy leading the market performance this year. stimulus measures in europe are also shifting from monetary to fiscal policies, which creates additional opportunities for investors. we sifted through the finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top nyse-listed stocks. we then selected the 11 stocks with a forward pe ratio under 15, as of april 8, that were also the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. the stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of q4 2024. the hedge fund data was sourced from insider monkeys database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? the reason is simple our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. our quarterly newsletters strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4 since may 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points see more details here. a close-up of a persons hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals. forward pe ratio as of april 8 9.02 number of hedge fund holders 91 merck co. nysemrk is a healthcare company that operates through two segments pharmaceutical and animal health. the company offers human health pharmaceuticals for various areas, which include oncology, vaccines, hospital acute care, cardiovascular, and neuroscience among others. it also provides veterinary pharmaceuticals, like vaccines and health management solutions and services. the companys keytruda sales increased by 18 year-over-year in 2024 and reached 29.5 billion. in q4 alone, these sales surged by 21 and generated 7.8 billion, which was driven by global demand across both metastatic and earlier-stage cancers. on february 24, dbs analyst nico chen reaffirmed a buy rating on the company while also maintaining his 100 price target due to keytrudas rapid growth. merck co. nysemrk has secured regulatory approvals for keytruda-based regimens in china, japan, and the us. it will also be seeking regulatory approval for other treatments by mid-2025, such as its investigational doravirineislatravir dorisl two-drug hiv-1 regimen. this new treatment proved as effective as standard therapies in two studies of adults with controlled hiv after 48 weeks. greenskeeper asset management stated the following regarding merck co., inc. nysemrk in its q3 2024 investor letter merck co., inc. nysemrk was our second-largest detractor this quarter, declining -8.3. mrks leading hpv vaccine, gardasil 9, faced challenges internationally due to inventory buildup within its chinese distributor, which is expected to reduce shipments for the remainder of 2024. despite this short-term impact, the long-term outlook for gardasil 9 remains promising. meanwhile, the companys 27 billion keytruda cancer juggernaut continues to grow at a healthy clip, powering earnings growth. overall, mrk ranks 10th on our list of cheap nyse stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. while we acknowledge the growth potential of mrk, our conviction lies in the belief that ai stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. there is an ai stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular ai stocks lost around 25. if you are looking for an ai stock that is more promising than mrk but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest ai stock. read next 20 best ai stocks to buy now and 30 best stocks to buy now according to billionaires disclosure none. this article is originally published at insider monkey.

  Title: The World's Biggest Companies Have Caused $28 Trillion in Climate Damage, a New Study Estimates
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-23 15:12:29)
  Content: washington ap the worlds biggest corporations have caused 28 trillion in climate damage, a new study estimates as part of an effort to make it easier for people and governments to hold companies financially accountable, like the tobacco giants have been. a dartmouth college research team came up with the estimated pollution caused by 111 companies, with more than half of the total dollar figure coming from 10 fossil fuel providers saudi aramco, gazprom, chevron, exxonmobil, bp, shell, national iranian oil co., pemex, coal india and the british coal corporation. for comparison, 28 trillion is a shade less than the sum of all goods and services produced in the united states last year. at the top of the list, saudi aramco and gazprom have each caused a bit more than 2 trillion in heat damage over the decades, the team calculated in a study published in wednesdays journal nature. the researchers figured that every 1 of greenhouse gas put into the atmosphere since 1990 has caused 502 billion in damage from heat alone, which doesnt include the costs incurred by other extreme weather such as hurricanes, droughts and floods. people talk about making polluters pay, and sometimes even take them to court or pass laws meant to rein them in. the study is an attempt to determine the causal linkages that underlie many of these theories of accountability, said its lead author, christopher callahan, who did the work at dartmouth but is now an earth systems scientist at stanford university. the research firm zero carbon analytics counts 68 lawsuits filed globally about climate change damage, with more than half of them in the united states. everybodys asking the same question what can we actually claim about who has caused this? said dartmouth climate scientist justin mankin, co-author of the study. and that really comes down to a thermodynamic question of can we trace climate hazards andor their damages back to particular emitters? the answer is yes, callahan and mankin said. the researchers started with known final emissions of the products such as gasoline or electricity from coal-fired power plants produced by the 111 biggest carbon-oriented companies going as far back as 137 years, because thats as far back as any of the companies emissions data go and carbon dioxide stays in the air for much longer than that. they used 1,000 different computer simulations to translate those emissions into changes for earths global average surface temperature by comparing it to a world without that companys emissions. using this approach, they determined that pollution from chevron, for example, has raised the earths temperature by .045 degrees fahrenheit .025 degrees celsius. the researchers also calculated how much each companys pollution contributed to the five hottest days of the year using 80 more computer simulations and then applying a formula that connects extreme heat intensity to changes in economic output. this system is modeled on the established techniques scientists have been using for more than a decade to attribute extreme weather events, such as the 2021 pacific northwest heat wave, to climate change. mankin said that in the past, there was an argument of, whos to say that its my molecule of co2 thats contributed to these damages versus any other one? he said his study really laid clear how the veil of plausible deniability doesnt exist anymore scientifically. we can actually trace harms back to major emitters. shell declined to comment. aramco, gazprom, chevron, exxon mobil and bp did not respond to requests for comment. all methods they use are quite robust, said imperial college london climate scientist friederike otto, who heads world weather attribution, a collection of scientists who try rapid attribution studies to see if specific extreme weather events are worsened by climate change and, if so, by how much. she didnt take part in the study. it would be good in my view if this approach would be taken up more by different groups. as with event attribution, the more groups do it, the better the science gets and the better we know what makes a difference and what does not, otto said. so far, no climate liability lawsuit against a major carbon emitter has been successful, but maybe showing how overwhelmingly strong the scientific evidence is can change that, she said. in the past, damage caused by individual companies were lost in the noise of data, so it couldnt be calculated, callahan said. we have now reached a point in the climate crisis where the total damages are so immense that the contributions of a single companys product can amount to tens of billions of dollars a year, said chris field, a stanford university climate scientist who didnt take part in the research. this is a good exercise and proof of concept, but there are so many other climate variables that the numbers that callahan and mankin came up with are probably a vast underestimate of the damage the companies have really caused, said michael mann, a university of pennsylvania climate scientist who wasnt involved in the study. ___ follow seth borenstein on x at borenbears. the associated press climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. ap is solely responsible for all content. find aps standards for working with philanthropies, a list of supporters and funded coverage areas at ap.org. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. we recently published a list of jim cramer reacts to the surprise market surge and highlights 8 key stocks in this article, we are going to take a look at where constellation brands, inc. nysestz stands against other key stocks that jim cramer highlights. in his latest appearance on cnbcs squawk on the street, jim cramer analyzed the extraordinary market turnaround following president trumps unexpected 90-day tariff reprieve. cramer explained just how abruptly the momentum changed the word that i kept hearing about is failed, that it would be a failed auction. it wasnt. and therefore, it was a save. once that save was made, in part because what the president did, you overrun what was the easiest trade of the year, which was the short mag 7, short technology, short semiconductors, and everything reversed. now, see, today, if youre short and the shorts are more or less the motif theyre feeling good because its down, but theyre going to cover. theyre going to cover because they got hurt so badly yesterday that their bosses are saying, we want your books more. thats historically what happens in these situations. so you may see all these down, but theyre not going to go back to where they were because were building in estimate cuts for everybody. and once theyre all built in, then its like 87. theyre all built in, and then you got to start figuring out. he was building too low. read also jim cramer questions market logic and dissects these 7 key stocks and jim cramer says tariff pain isnt over yet and reviews these 9 stocks he also painted the market as a high-stakes showdown between short sellers and bulls, warning that the tide may have turned decisively its a great day for the longs, bad day for the shorts. what im talking about is that its a battle between longs and shorts. and the shorts are trying to keep their jobs after being victorious for so long. and the longs are revelling in what happened here because the 10, except for, of course, what you talked about, which is the embargo. finally, cramer credited a single trump tweet with flipping the entire market narrative yes, we are, given the fact that we should be in a hot seat estate, which is, were on a recession territory, ground, so whatever you want to say, until the tweet. is that not insane? that a tweet came out and we went from being a recession to being up. the guy gave you the best call ive seen in my career, and yet there are people who are critical of that. i mean, come on. he got the nasdaq to have the greatest single day ever, and he let you in. how many strategies have that kind of power? to make our list of the stocks that jim cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during cnbcs squawk on the street aired on april 10th. for these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? the reason is simple our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. our quarterly newsletters strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4 since may 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points see more details here. number of hedge fund holders 51 while talking about earnings reports, jim cramer focused on the weakness in alcohol consumption and a surprising slowdown in beer demand. cramer used constellation brands, inc. nysestz as a case study in this changing consumer behavior. heres what he said a rather shocking guide down. beer will be flat no longer 7 to 9 two years. they got modelo, which is the number one brand. what this says is, without a doubt, that alcohol continues to slow. consumption continues to slow. we dont know. now, this company over-indexed for hispanics. theres always a chance that perhaps hispanics are unfortunately laying low because of whats ever happening in our country. thats whats happened before. but whats more important is glp-1. the craving for beer is no more than the craving for sparkling water. so id rather have a sparkling water. theres big studies going on right now that show that. and no one in the industry is willing to admit it. overall, stz ranks 7th on our list of key stocks that jim cramer highlights. while we acknowledge the potential of stz as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some ai stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. there is an ai stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular ai stocks lost around 25. if you are looking for an ai stock that is more promising than stz but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest ai stock. read next 20 best ai stocks to buy now and 30 best stocks to buy now according to billionaires. disclosure none. this article is originally published at insider monkey.

in tesla layoffs hit government workers. but first, the big day has arrived. if this was forwarded to you, sign up here. today is us president donald trumps so-called liberation day the day when he is set to unveil a range of sweeping tariffs on key trading partners. trump wrote back in february that the us would feel some pain with tariffs, but it will all be worth the price that must be paid. that pain is already here, bis ayelet sheffey writes. companies have warned of rising prices markets have plunged bad vibes are back. trade experts have said companies might absorb some of the cost of the planned tariffs, but americans are likely to see higher prices on goods like groceries and cars. read all the tariffs trump has threatened to impose here. trump has said that his plans would promote production in the us. in the meantime, the uncertainty is leaving markets, businesses, and americans on edge. as one retiree who voted for trump told bi i hope he knows what hes doing, but im not so sure. options trades can offer a hint of how the stock market might react. according to options data tracked by equity derivative strategists at jpmorgan, the sp 500 is projected to move as much as 1.6 in response to the tariff announcement. the nasdaq 100 and rusell 2000 could move 1.8 and 2.1, respectively. the white house has sent contradicting policy signals, and it remains unclear

officer said the company is ending diversity hiring targets, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by bi. adobe joins the likes of meta and google in slashing dei efforts. 2. the traditional coding interview is at a crossroads. many software engineers are increasingly expected to use ai on the job. however, as ai advances, cheating on coding tests is becoming more seamless and its raising new ethical questions for hiring managers. 3. meta just lost a key ai leader. head of ai research joelle pineau is leaving the company at the end of may. her departure comes as meta seeks to step up competition with its rivals, pouring as much as 65 billion into the space. 1. trumps latest ivy league target princeton. the trump administration froze federal research grants at the

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
