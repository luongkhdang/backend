  Title: Police seize enough fentanyl ‘to kill everyone in Portland twice,’ arrest 46 in multi-agency trafficking crackdown
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-22 23:31:33)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article highlights a state-level response (law enforcement agencies) to a perceived threat (fentanyl trafficking) originating from a non-state actor (Sinaloa Cartel) across international borders. This aligns with Realist theory, where states prioritize security and power in an anarchic international system. The quote 'our partnership with local, state, and federal agencies makes our collective response stronger' exemplifies the state's attempt to consolidate power to address the threat.; Intriguing_angles: The article emphasizes the success of the operation and the collaboration between agencies, but it doesn't delve into the root causes of the drug crisis or the social factors contributing to drug use and trafficking. This omission could be a deliberate choice to focus on the immediate law enforcement response rather than addressing the more complex underlying issues. What are the long-term strategies to address the root causes of drug trafficking and addiction in Portland?

  Title: 100 DAYS OF PUNISHING FOES...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article demonstrates how Trump actively shapes the public's perception by prioritizing certain narratives (e.g., 'political weaponization,' 'lies and abuses') and repeatedly emphasizing them. The text states Trump 'repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate' and 'denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him.' This constant reinforcement influences which issues voters deem important, potentially overshadowing other concerns.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the speed and scope of Trump's actions, noting that 'even the smallest slights drawing reprisals.' This suggests a potential underlying mechanism of personal vendettas driving policy decisions, raising questions about the stability and predictability of the administration's actions. What are the long-term consequences of such personalized governance?; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work.' This raises questions about the ethical implications of such arrangements and whether they constitute a form of extortion or coercion. Does this set a dangerous precedent for future interactions between the government and private entities?

  Content: reuters -hours after swearing an oath to defend the u.s. constitution on january 20, president donald trump signed an executive order directing his attorney general to scour the justice department and other agencies for evidence of political weaponization. the same day, pentagon staff took down a portrait of mark milley, a trump critic who as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been the highest-ranking military officer during trumps first term. that evening, trump stripped his former national security adviser, john bolton - who wrote a memoir critical of trump - of the protective secret service detail he had been given after the justice department said iran had threatened boltons life. in his first 100 days, trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies. these include former intelligence officials who investigated alleged russian ties to his 2016 election campaign and major law firms as well as former biden administration members and prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against him while he was out of power. trumps actions served notice that his campaign promise of political retribution was anything but rhetorical, after he repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate. but the speed and sweep of his actions have caught many by surprise, with even the smallest slights drawing reprisals. the republican president has used the machinery of the state and the power of the presidency to go after people and institutions that have aggrieved him in more expansive ways than any of his predecessors, historians said. its not unusual for presidents to have enemies, said jeremi suri, a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin. what is unusual is for the president to use the entirety of the federal government, not simply to exclude someone, but to directly punish them. trump has made particular use of executive orders - typically used by presidents to direct policy priorities - to target perceived foes by stripping them of security clearances, blocking them from government buildings or directing agencies to probe them for wrongdoing. he has launched multiple federal probes into maine after a verbal spat with the states governor, reached deep into the traditionally independent justice department to fire those he views as disloyal, pulled protective security details from his critics and ordered investigations into former officials who challenged his false claims that his 2020 election loss was rigged. on his first day in office, he removed clearances for 50 former national security officials who had signed a letter suggesting russia was behind a story about salacious material found on a laptop belonging to president joe bidens son hunter. no evidence of russian involvement has emerged. he has also taken away clearances for all three democrats who ran against him in presidential contests biden, hillary clinton and kamala harris. trump has focused much of his attention on the criminal justice system after claiming during his 2024 presidential campaign that his four indictments were motivated by politics. then-president joe bidens administration denied the accusations. in trumps first 100 days, his justice department has fired or demoted dozens of officials, prosecutors and fbi agents, including rank-and-file employees who worked on investigations into trump and the january 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob of trump supporters. in a speech at the justice departments headquarters in february, trump denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him with illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. traditional presidencies have failed to bring meaningful change to the ways of washington, and the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy, a white house spokesman, harrison fields, said in response to questions about trumps retribution efforts and whether they represent an abuse of power. utilizing every tool afforded by the constitution, the trump administration is prioritizing efficiency eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and fulfilling every campaign promise. the ferocity and the scope during his first term, trumps instincts for revenge were sometimes thwarted by his own appointees, many of whom were experienced government hands or establishment republicans. by contrast, trump has filled his second-term administration with steadfast loyalists more likely to back his directives than caution against them. meanwhile, the republican majority in congress has shown little interest in opposing his actions. trump has taken steps as well to eliminate internal watchdogs who might seek to constrain him, purging inspectors general and firing government ethics officials. all administrations, particularly when you see a switch from one party to another, seek to control the executive branch, said historian timothy naftali, the former director of the richard nixon presidential library and museum. its the ferocity and the scope of what hes done that makes it unprecedented. the republican nixon famously had a list of enemies, but he plotted against them in secret. his most aggressive ideas, such as using the tax-collecting internal revenue service to audit his foes, were often blocked by his own officials. other presidents have used their power to penalize rivals in more muted ways, suri said. democrat lyndon johnson sought to discredit his political rival, robert kennedy, in the news media, and republican george w. bush banned brent scowcroft, a former national security adviser, from the white house after scowcroft wrote a column opposing the iraq war. thats often how presidents use their power to go after enemies they keep them out of their administration and spread rumors about them, suri said. trump has frequently intertwined his personal animus against political opponents with his administrations ideological and policy objectives. in february, trump digressed from remarks during a white house meeting with governors to address maine governor janet mills, warning her to comply with an order banning transgender athletes. see you in court, mills, a democrat, replied defiantly. within a day, three separate federal departments had initiated inquiries into whether the state was violating civil rights law, imperiling millions of dollars in federal funding. the justice department sent mills a letter telling her maine was on notice while trump demanded a full-throated apology before the case can be settled. in early april, trumps agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, wrote mills to confirm that some school funding had been frozen. this is only the beginning, rollins warned her. nine days later, the education department said it was taking steps to cut off all federal school funding to the state, and last week attorney general pam bondi announced the justice department had sued maine in federal court. in recent weeks, trump has attacked law firms that once employed attorneys he views as enemies, arguing they undermined the judicial process by doing so. in february, he suspended security clearances for attorneys at the law firm covington burling who had represented smith, the former special counsel investigating him, and sought to cancel any government work the firm had. making little effort to hide his primary motivation, trump suggested sending the pen he used to sign the order to smith as a souvenir. trump has signed executive orders targeting five other law firms, in each case indicating that revenge was an essential factor. his order punishing wilmerhale, for instance, noted that it once employed robert mueller, who investigated whether trumps 2016 campaign had improper connections with russia. nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work on mutually agreed projects backed by the administration. in some cases, trump simply appears determined to get even with former members of his 2017-2021 administration who irked him. this month, the president ordered the justice department to investigate christopher krebs, his former cybersecurity chief who disputed trumps false claims about election fraud in 2020, and miles taylor, a former homeland security official who anonymously wrote a 2019 book critical of trump. signing the executive order targeting the two former officials, trump called taylor a traitor. i think hes guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth, but well find out, he said. dissent isnt unlawful, taylor responded on x. it certainly isnt treasonous. reporting by

  Title: Fake Alpine Quest Mapping App Spotted Spying on Russian Military
  Source: hackread.com (2025-04-22 21:26:10)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Realism, the article highlights the ongoing competition between states (or state-affiliated actors) in the cyber domain. The targeting of Russian military personnel through a compromised app, as evidenced by "fake alpine quest app laced with spyware was used to target russian military android devices, stealing location data, contacts, and sensitive files," demonstrates a pursuit of strategic advantage through intelligence gathering. This suggests a constant state of low-intensity conflict where information is a valuable resource.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that "at the time of writing, the group behind the campaign has not been identified, and it remains unclear whether this operation is domestic or foreign in origin." This lack of immediate attribution, despite similarities to past Ukrainian hacktivist activities, raises questions about the complexity of cyber warfare. Could this ambiguity be intentional, designed to obscure the true source and avoid direct repercussions?

  Content: fake alpine quest app laced with spyware was used to target russian military android devices, stealing location data, contacts, and sensitive files. a malicious version of alpine quest, a popular android navigation app, has been found carrying spyware aimed at russian military personnel. security researchers at doctor web uncovered the modified software embedded with android.spy.1292.origin spyware capable of harvesting data and extending its functionality through remote commands. alpine quest is commonly used by outdoor enthusiasts, but its also relied on by soldiers in russias military zones due to its offline mapping features. that made it a convenient cover for attackers, who repackaged an older version of the app and pushed it as a free download through a fake telegram channel. the link led to an app store targeting russian users, where the infected software was listed as a pro version of the app. once installed, the spyware collects all sorts of information. each time the app is opened, it sends the users phone number, account details, contacts, geolocation, and a list of files stored on the device to a remote server. some of this data is also sent to a telegram bot controlled by the attackers, including updated location details every time the user moves. left telegram channel promoting the malicious alpine quest app in russian via dr. web right english translation of the image using yandex ai, via hackread.com. doctor webs analysis shows that this spyware is capable of more than passive tracking. after identifying which files are available, the malware can be instructed to download new modules designed to extract specific content. based on its behaviour, the attackers appear especially interested in documents shared through messaging apps like telegram and whatsapp. it also seeks out a file called loclog, created by alpine quest itself, which logs user movements in detail. because the spyware is bundled with a working version of the app, it looks and functions normally, giving it time to operate unnoticed. its modular design also means its capabilities can grow over time, depending on the attackers goals. doctor web advises users to avoid downloading apps from unofficial sources, even when they appear to offer free access to paid features. even on official app stores, its best to avoid installing apps you dont truly need. malicious apps have been known to slip past review processes on both google play and the app store. at the time of writing, the group behind the campaign has not been identified, and it remains unclear whether this operation is domestic or foreign in origin. however, similar operations in the past have been linked to ukrainian hacktivist groups, including cyber resistance, also known as the ukrainian cyber alliance. in 2023, they reportedly targeted spouses of russian military personnel, extracting sensitive and personal data. however, there is still no confirmed attribution for the group behind this spyware campaign.

  Title: Many 'snowbirds' in USA looking to pack up and fly north -- for good...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism is relevant here. The article illustrates how a shift in the U.S. administration's policies and rhetoric, specifically "steep trade tariffs" and "suggestions that canada should become a u.s. state," directly impacts Canada's economic and social well-being. This aligns with Realism's emphasis on states acting in their self-interest and the pursuit of power, leading to a competitive and sometimes conflictual international environment. The resulting "chill that has blanketed relations" and the economic consequences for both countries demonstrate the core tenets of Realist thought.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that some Canadians are "quietly preparing to let go of their second homes" but "holding back to see how things play out." This suggests a level of uncertainty and a potential for further shifts in behavior depending on future political developments. What specific political or economic indicators are these Canadians monitoring, and what threshold would trigger a more widespread exodus?; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the economic reliance of South Florida on Canadian snowbirds, stating they "either own property and pay property tax or rent for the winter months - either way, a boost to the economy." However, it doesn't quantify the overall economic impact or explore potential mitigation strategies. What percentage of South Florida's economy is directly attributable to Canadian snowbirds, and what alternative revenue streams are being considered to offset the potential loss?

  Content: by doyinsola oladipo and mrinalika roy reuters -the number of canadian snowbirds planning to sell their second homes in sunny florida and arizona has surged this spring, many of them put off by the sudden chill that has blanketed relations between their homeland and the u.s. real estate agents say they are seeing more canadians cashing out, further softening property prices in warm-weather states that have long attracted retirees and tourists from cold and snowy canada. canadians spent close to 6 billion on u.s. real estate from april 2023 to march 2024 - making up 13 of all foreign transactions - more than any other nationality, according to data from the national association of realtors. nearly half of the homes purchased by canadians were for vacation purposes, with florida, arizona and hawaii ranking as the top markets. last week, tracy and dale mcmullen sold their vacation home in buckeye, arizona, a property they owned for five years. the alberta residents, who usually spend four to five months in arizona a year, said they are not planning to come back. we decided to sell the property after the current potus took office, said dale, referring to u.s. president donald trump, who was inaugurated for the second time in january. it was time to leave. we felt we could not trust what he might do next to us as individuals and to our country. we no longer felt welcome nor safe. canadians are feeling stung by the actions and words of the trump administration, which has imposed steep trade tariffs on its northern neighbor, threatening canadas export-dependent economy. trumps repeated suggestions that canada should become a u.s. state, and his derogatory references to now-former prime minister justin trudeau as governor have annoyed canadians and offended their national pride. as a result, many canadians are boycotting u.s.-made goods, such as bourbon and produce and canceling trips to u.s. destinations. canadian return flights from the u.s. fell 13.5 in march from a year earlier, according to statistics canada. canadian-resident return trips by automobile fell about 32. real estate is now facing a similar pullback in demand. laurie lavine, a realtor in arizona who helped the mcmullens with their sale, told reuters that he currently has 18 listings from canadians looking to sell, compared with the usual two to four per quarter. trade friction and the current weakness of the canadian dollar are also contributing to the pullback, lavine said. canadians are also feeling picked on, with u.s. border agents enforcing stricter rules on entering the country, he added. beginning this month, the trump administration is requiring all foreigners 14 or older to register and submit fingerprints if they stay beyond 30 days. canadians, who previously could visit for up to six months without a visa, are subject to the new requirement. the sour feelings that many canadians suddenly feel toward the u.s. are having a big impact on the property market in florida, one of the closest warm-weather states to ontario and quebec, canadas most populous provinces. south floridas residential market has for decades been reliant on the annual influx of canadian snowbirds who either own property and pay property tax or rent for the winter months - either way, a boost to the economy, said ermengarde jabir, a director of economic research at moodys analytics. the first quarter is typically the peak buying season for condominiums in the region, coinciding with when many snowbirds are in town, said andrea hartmann, managing partner of the sandy hartmann group, a real estate firm in the tampa bay area. since the beginning of the year we have not received an offer from a canadian buyer even once, and normally we would, she said. floridas housing market is already reeling. prospective buyers have faced rising insurance premiums, concerns over climate change and a series of devastating hurricanes in recent years. in the tampa-st. petersburg-clearwater region, mortgage lock volume for second homes - or the number of buyers securing rates ahead of purchases - fell 25 on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2025, according to optimal blue, a mortgage technology and data company. now with the political issue, the cost of maintaining a place here in florida and the insurance, a lot of them decided to sell and go, said ken obrian, owner of southwest coast realty in naples, which has specialized in helping canadians purchase properties in florida for about 20 years. there is no incentive to come to the states anymore, said donny b., a native of ontario who is looking to sell his two investment properties in florida. like many snowbirds interviewed for this story, he declined to give his surname, saying he feared backlash. he said he decided to sell because of the political uncertainty, the exchange rate and concern about whether floridians would still welcome canadians in the current climate. i got down here on wednesday and i was nervous. im like, are people going to be pissed off at me? other states have started to see an exodus as well. agents in los angeles and palm springs, california, are working with canadian sellers who are quietly preparing to let go of their second homes, said fatima malik, global real estate advisor at engel volkers beverly hills. some are holding back to see how things play out, but others are already shifting their sights toward places like portugal, mexico, and parts of france, she added. reporting by doyinsola oladipo in new york and mrinalika roy in bengaluru editing by frank mcgurty and paul simao

russia on its expansive list of countries that will face major new tariffs starting today as vladimir putins top negotiator held meetings in washington. at the same time, war-hit ukraine is facing 10 per cent tariffs from the us administration. the white house has not explained why russia will not face tariffs. mr putins investment envoy and one of the most us-savvy members of russias elite, kirill dmitriev, met with us officials in washington yesterday. the highest-ranking russian official to visit the us since the invasion in february 2022, he is visiting on invitation from mr trumps

deployment of a so-called reassurance force in ukraine, five officials aware of the plan told the financial times. the reassurance force would also use natos shared intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, under the proposal, ft reported. this proposal is one of the several options being discussed by european allies and could be changed before any final agreement, according

leading security strategist rachel ellehuus, director-general of the royal united services institute rusi and former pentagon official with expertise in nato and transatlantic defence. russian forces unleashed an hour-long barrage of drones on kharkiv, ukraines second city, late last night, triggering a number of fires but causing no casualties in the second such attack in the course of the day, the regional governor said. in the space of just one hour, the enemy deployed 17 iranian-designed shahed drones, said governor oleh syniehubov. most of the strikes were in the kyiv district. local fires broke out. fortunately, there were no casualties, he said. the same district had come under attack earlier in the day, with officials reporting five people injured. a team from ukraine may be coming to the united states as soon as this week or next week, us treasury secretary scott bessent told bloomberg television yesterday, amid efforts to end the war with russia. last week, the top us official had said ukraine may sign an economic deal this week. we have passed along a completed document for the economic partnership that is currently being reviewed by ukrainians, and we hope to go to full discussions and perhaps even get signatures next week, mr bessent had said. the trump administration has not included russia on its expansive list of countries that will face major new tariffs. the white house has not explained why russia will not face tariffs. president donald trump announced plans for sweeping tariffs last night, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. ukraine was slapped with a 10 per cent levy, according to a fact sheet released by the white house. this comes as vladimir putins investment envoy kirill dmitriev met with us officials in washington yesterday as the trump administration continues to press russia and ukraine to agree to a ceasefire, two us officials familiar with the matter said. at least 11 more ukrainian children have been brought home from parts of russia and russian-occupied ukraine where they had been taken without permission, volodymyr zelenskys chief of staff said yesterday. today we have one more piece of good news, andriy yermak, the chief of staff, wrote on his telegram channel. within the framework of the president of ukraines bring kids back ua initiative, another 11 ukrainian children were brought back from temporarily occupied areas of ukraine and the territory of the russian federation, he said. among the children, mr yermak said, were brothers aged 10 and 12 whose father died after being tortured for expressing pro-ukrainian views. also brought home, mr yermak wrote, was a pregnant mother who had been prevented from leaving occupied ukraine because she had refused to take out russian identity papers, and her two-year-old toddler. the mother gave birth to another child in ukrainian-held territory. mr yermak thanked the office of ukraines ombudsman for its help in arranging the return of the children. russia has not issued a statement on returning ukrainian citizens. half of the us senate, including 25 republicans and 25 democrats, banded together to introduce prospective sanctions on russia which would be imposed if it refuses to engage in good faith negotiations with ukraine. led by republican senator lindsey graham and democratic senator richard blumenthal, the group said it would impose primary and secondary sanctions against russia if moscow does not engage in talks or initiated another attempt to undermine ukraines sovereignty. the sanctions against russia require tariffs on countries who purchase russian oil, gas, uranium and other products. they are hard hitting for a reason, the two senators said in a statement, a rare moment of bipartisanship in a divided congress. the dominating view in the united states senate is that russia is the aggressor, and that this horrific war and putins aggression must end now and be deterred in the future, they said. donald trump has hailed good cooperation between russia and ukraine as he underlined his desire to stop the war. speaking from the white house as he announced tariffs on us imports of goods from around the world, mr trump said were going to get it stopped. he added its a senseless war that would have never happened if i was president and it shouldnt be allowed to go on. and i think weve been given good cooperation by russia and by ukraine, but we have to get it stopped. its humanity. its humanity. its a terrible thing. a us visit by vladimir putins envoy kirill dmitriev is possible, the kremlin said on wednesday. contacts between moscow and washington are continuing, a kremlin spokesperson added. reuters reported that dmitriev is expected in washington this week for talks with donald trumps administration. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: Calmes: Making America a colonizer again
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-03 14:05:25)
  Content: the self-professed make america great again president is yet again reaching back to some bad old days in his chaotic quest for this never-defined national greatness. and yet again, donald trump is shaming what actually is was? a great nation. with punitive tariffs this week, hes ushering in not his promised golden age but a global trade war. predictably, consumers and businesses are collateral damage, suddenly facing higher prices, layoffs, depressed retirement accounts and fears of recession. some liberation day. separately, trump is overseeing migrant roundups, detentions and deportations that lack any semblance of constitutional due process. his agents are sweeping up legal residents in their opaque nets, labeling the whole unidentified lot as terrorists and shipping most of them off by planeloads to a salvadoran megaprison. scores of families plead that the government is mistaken, and this week the trump administration uncharacteristically did concede to one administrative error it told a federal judge that it wrongly nabbed a 29-year-old maryland man after hed left work and picked up his 5-year-old son, who has autism. voices calmes its a break-glass moment in washington, but then what? democrats are all but impotent republicans have capitulated the media is fractured. theres only one bulwark left to counter the emergency unfolding in washington and yet the same u.s. government that pays el salvador millions to do its dirty work and whose president is a strongman wannabe told the court that it cant get kilmar armando abrego garcia out of the foreign prison and back home to maryland. less noticed amid the economic chaos and extrajudicial deportations is yet another travesty that strikes at the foundation of the countrys proud legacy as a world leader the world leader since world war ii the ever-transactional trumps sordid, neocolonial attempt to extort ukraine of its wealth of oil, gas, critical minerals and rare-earth elements as repayment for the united states support in the ukrainians defense against russias invasion. americans may be distracted but foreigners and global market-watchers have noticed. as ukraines president volodymyr zelensky resists trumps latest one-sided demands, which dropped on friday, bloomberg news headline was u.s. seeks to control ukraine investment, squeezing out europe. more colorfully, the telegraph of london reported , america holds gun to zelenskys head with unprecedented reparation demands. its article quoted alan riley , an expert on global energy law at the atlantic council, who damned the proposal as an expropriation document and added, ive never seen anything like it before. certainly nothing like it has been seen since 1948, when the united states solidified its postwar leadership and banked global goodwill with the marshall plan , which rebuilt war-ravaged europe, including former enemies. over four years, president truman and congress provided bipartisan aid roughly equivalent to 175 billion today. all the while, u.s. politicians persuaded americans that the aid they were paying for was neither selfless nor a giveaway in reviving europe, the united states was recovering markets for its products and stabilizing democratic allies to withstand further world wars. as the laws advocate, secretary of state george c. marshall jr., stated, the program reflected a willingness on the part of our people to face up to the vast responsibilities which history has clearly placed upon our country. how far weve fallen. youd have to go back several centuries when european powers colonized and plundered africa, asia and the americas to find the sorry model for trumps attempt to extract ukraines resources and greenlands valued at trillions of dollars . but its all the worse considering that ukraine, a democratic ally, has spilled its own blood and treasure to withstand and weaken russia, a u.s. adversary, and asks only for aid not troops to hold the line against would-be czar vladimir putins dreams of empire. voices calmes the united states careens toward a constitutional crisis what should the american people believe - trumps denials that hes defying court orders or the evidence that can be seen and heard? in fairness, trump is arguably following up on overtures from zelensky last year to the biden administration for u.s.-ukraine cooperation in developing his countrys minerals and energy riches. but zelenskys offer was always in exchange for a u.s. guarantee of its security, perhaps nato membership or american peacekeeping troops. trump has refused to agree to that. the tension over a security guarantee was behind trumps and vice president jd vances february oval office pile-on that humiliated zelensky and sickened u.s. allies. that debacle derailed a minerals deal, but negotiations resumed in recent weeks. after all, zelensky doesnt have much choice you dont have the cards, trump mocked him. this much is true ukraines future relies on u.s. help, despite europes talk of filling the void. trumps 55-page proposal calls for a u.s.-controlled investment fund to develop ukraines resources, including minerals such as lithium and titanium that are essential for electric cars and other products based on modern technology. from ukraines half of all proceeds, it would have to repay the united states for all past aid none of which was provided on such terms, and most of which went to u.s. defense plants for weaponry plus 4 interest. all with no u.s. security guarantee for ukraine. and, just like trumps purported peace talks with russia, the proposed minerals deal cuts out ukraines more stalwart european allies, who, contrary to his repeated falsehoods, have collectively contributed more to ukraine than the united states has asking nothing in return. on sunday, trump told reporters that zelensky is trying to back out of a deal. he added, for thuggish effect, if he does that, hes got some problems. big, big problems. yes, zelensky has big problems. but he and his country have their pride. which is more than america will be left with if trump has his way. jackiekcalmes

Germany's veto of the Eurofighter sale to Turkey, after the jailing of Istanbul's mayor, and Turkey's subsequent assertion that its national interests supersede individual politicians ('turkeys national interests are more valuable than erdoğan or imamoğlu') exemplifies the realist emphasis on national interest and power politics in international relations.

  Title: Trump's agenda grapples with political and economic reality - BBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-05 00:02:40)
  Content: donald trump, in announcing his sweeping new tariffs on us imports on wednesday, promised that the history books would record 2 april as americas liberation day. after two days of stock market turmoil, however, this may also be remembered as the week the presidents second-term agenda ran headfirst into economic - and political - reality. us stocks have been in a tailspin since trump unveiled his tariffs at wednesday afternoons white house rose garden event, with signs that americas trading partners - canada, the european union and china, most notably - are not backing away from a fight. meanwhile, other presidential efforts, on foreign policy and immigration, and at the ballot box - have faced notable setbacks in recent days. the white house on thursday felt a bit like a building battening down for a coming storm. the four big posters showing americas reciprocal tariffs on a long list of countries were on prominent display in the press briefing room, but administration officials available to respond to media questions were few and far between. out on pennsylvania avenue, workers unloaded pallets of metal fencing, which will ring the white house grounds in preparation for what officials anticipate to be a large anti-trump demonstration at the nearby washington monument on saturday. the first lady announced that a white house garden tour event that had been scheduled for that day was postponed because of security concerns. even the normally loquacious president stopped only briefly to talk with the crush of reporters on his way to board the marine one helicopter on the first leg of his journey to florida. i said this would be exactly the way it is, he declared when asked about the days stock market turmoil. the markets - and america as a whole - would soon boom, he said. the president, it seems, is willing to wait out the tempest created by his tariff plan. he appears confident that his economic vision of a rebuilt, job-rich american manufacturing sector protected from foreign competition - a vision he has closely held for decades - will ultimately be proven right. the trump agendas close encounter with cold, hard reality wasnt limited to trade this week, however. his two top foreign policy priorities - ending the wars in gaza and ukraine - both appear mired in the kind of messy details and conflicting agendas that often obstruct lasting peace. israel has once again moved into gaza and escalated a bombing campaign that is generating reports of widespread civilian casualties. the ceasefire that trump touted in the days before he took office appears to be in tatters. russia, meanwhile, continues to pile new conditions on to negotiations for a full ceasefire with ukraine, which is an indication that the nation may be buying time to allow its ground forces to take more territory. if i think theyre tapping us along, i will not be happy about it, trump said of russia. but he added that he still believes president vladimir putin wants to make a deal. evidence so far indicates the contrary, according to jake sullivan, who was president joe bidens national security adviser. in an interview with the bbc, he accused trump of handing russia most of its demands, though he acknowledged it was still early in the process and things could yet change. so the current dynamic in these negotiations a is not in fact producing russian willingness to reach a fair and just compromise, but b is actually stimulating a view in moscow that if they just keep holding out, theyre just going to keep getting concessions from the united states. and so far that is what has happened. even trumps deportation and immigration enforcement efforts, which still have high public support, have been at least partially derailed by legal challenges. while his administration has successfully completed several flights transferring alleged tren de aragua venezuelan gang members to an el salvadoran high-security prison, the judge presiding over a case challenging those deportations said on thursday there was a fair likelihood officials had violated his court order to turn the flights around. other court challenges - to trumps suspension of political asylum processing and refugee resettlement, his attempt to end birthright citizenship and his revocation of temporary protected status for about 350,000 venezuelans - are currently working their way through the us legal system. at some point, the us supreme court is expected to weigh in on many of these disputes. this week also marked the biggest round of elections since trumps november 2024 victory, as voters headed to the polls in wisconsin to elect a state judge and in two florida special elections for seats in the house of representatives. while the republican candidates in florida prevailed, their winning margins were about 15, which is about half of what trump posted in those congressional districts in november. in wisconsin, a key political battleground state, the democratic-backed candidate won. democrats were able to maintain the liberal majority on the court despite the tens of millions of dollars spent by conservative groups, including by tech billionaire elon musk, who campaigned there in person. taken as a whole the results suggest that democrats are doing well in hotly contested races and may be making inroads even in reliably conservative areas - in part by campaigning against musk and his efforts to massively cut federal programmes and staff. that could be an indication that the party will have the political wind at their backs in state elections this november and the midterm congressional elections next year. the stock market tumult, and those ballot-box results, may be behind a few scattered signs of dissent within republican ranks. ted cruz, an arch-conservative senator from texas, said on his podcast on friday that trumps tariffs could hurt jobs and could hurt america - particularly if other nations retaliate, as china has already done. if were in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now, with massive american tariffs, and massive tariffs on american goods in every other country on earth, that is a terrible outcome, he continued. on wednesday night in the us senate, four republicans joined with democrats to support rescinding the emergency declaration that justifies trumps earlier canada tariffs. and on thursday, republican senator chuck grassley of iowa joined with democrat maria cantwell of washington to back a measure that would require congress to directly approve tariffs that stay in effect longer than 60 days. republicans by and large have been sticking with the president. they seem unwilling, or unable, to sway trump from his current course on tariffs and government cuts and appear fearful of the political consequences of breaking with the man who has a vise-like grip on the party. but if the current economic shock becomes a long-term hardship, and if government programme cuts translate into tangible disruptions in popular services or if trumps standing in opinion polls continues to sag, members of his own party may begin eyeing the exit signs for the first time in years. and that would bring an unceremonious end to some of trumps most ambitious efforts. trump, no longer worried about standing before voters, may feel liberated from the immediate political consequences of his actions - but reality has a way of asserting itself in the end.

  Title: Trump announces huge new tariffs to promote US manufacturing, risking inflation and trade wars
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 20:57:51)
  Content: by josh boak associated press washington president donald trump declared on wednesday a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the united states, threatening to upend much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars. trump held up a chart while speaking at the white house, showing the united states would charge a 34 tax on imports from china, a 20 tax on imports from the european union, 25 on south korea, 24 on japan and 32 on taiwan. the president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the united states helped to build after world war ii, saying our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered by other nations. trump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. he has promised that factory jobs will return back to the united states as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods. taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, trump said in remarks at the white house. but it is not going to happen anymore. trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called reciprocal tariffs on trade partners, acting without congress through the 1977 international emergency powers act in an extraordinary attempt to both break and ultimately reshape americas trading relationship with the world. the presidents higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the united states than they buy, meaning the tariffs could stay in place for some time as the administration expects other nations to lower their tariffs and other barriers to trade that it says have led to a 1.2 trillion trade imbalance last year. the new tariffs, coming on what trump has named liberation day, are a bid to boost u.s. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he says are years of unfair trade practices. but by most economists assessments, the move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and upend decades-old alliances. the white house is exuding confidence despite the political and financial gamble. april 2, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern american history, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said tuesday. she said the new tariffs would take effect immediately. none of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose has caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy. white house trade adviser peter navarro has suggested the new tariffs would raise 600 billion annually, which would be the largest tax increase since world war ii. treasury secretary scott bessent told lawmakers the tariffs would be capped and could be negotiated downward by other countries, according to the office of rep. kevin hern, r-okla. importers would likely pass along some of the cost of the taxes on to consumers. the budget lab at yale university estimates that a 20 universal tariff would cost the average household an additional 3,400 to 4,200. the republican administrations premise is that manufacturers will quickly increase domestic production and create factory jobs. based on the possibility of broad 20 tariffs that have been floated by some white house aides, most analyses see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnation. u.s. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would be roughly a percentage point lower, and clothing, oil, automobiles, housing, groceries and even insurance would cost more, the budget lab analysis found. trump would be applying these tariffs on his own he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. that makes it easy for democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come. heather boushey, a member of the biden white houses council of economic advisers, noted that the less aggressive tariffs trump imposed during his first term failed to stir the manufacturing renaissance he promised voters. we are not seeing indications of the boom that the president promised, boushey said. its a failed strategy. rep. suzan delbene, d-wash., said the tariffs are part of the chaos and dysfunction being generated across the trump administration. the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee stressed that trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers approval, saying that republicans so far have been blindly loyal. the president shouldnt be able to do that, delbene said. this is a massive tax increase on american families, and its without a vote in congress president trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. now he says he doesnt care if prices go up hes broken his promise. even republicans who trust trumps instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 unemployment rate. well see how it all develops, said house speaker mike johnson, r-la. it may be rocky in the beginning. but i think that this will make sense for americans and help all americans. longtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. canada has imposed some in response to the 25 tariffs that trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. the european union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros worth 28 billion of u.s. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted trump to threaten a 200 tariff on european alcohol. many allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by trump, who routinely says americas friends and foes have essentially ripped off the united states with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers. the flip side is that americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by french fashion houses and autos from german manufacturers, whereas world bank data show the eu has lower incomes per capita than the u.s. europe has not started this confrontation, said european commission president ursula von der leyen. we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it. italys premier, giorgia meloni, on wednesday reiterated her call to avoid an eu-us trade war, saying it would harm both sides and would have heavy consequences for her countrys economy. because trump has hyped his tariffs without providing specifics, he has provided a deeper sense of uncertainty for the world, a sign that the economic slowdown could possibly extend beyond u.s. borders to other nations that would see one person to blame. ray sparnaay, general manager of je fixture tool, a canadian tool and die business that sits across the detroit river, said the uncertainty has crushed his companys ability to make plans. theres going to be tariffs implemented. we just dont know at this point, he said monday. thats one of the biggest problems weve had probably the last well, since november is the uncertainty. its basically slowed all of our quoting processes, business that we hope to secure has been stalled. leavitt is among three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the associated press on first and fifth amendment grounds. the ap says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. the white house says the ap is not following an executive order to refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america. associated press writers mike householder in oldcastle, ontario, sylvie corbet in paris and lisa mascaro contributed to this report.

  Title: Republican backlash to Trump tariffs grows as Senate rebels decry ‘bad policy’
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-03 17:29:12)
  Content: the first signs of an internal us political backlash against donald trumps declaration of a global trade war are starting to emerge amid tanking stock markets worldwide, including on wall street, and widespread international criticism of the move. hours after trump unveiled a sweeping panoply of tariffs in an event he dubbed liberation day, four republican senators openly defied him by voting for a senate resolution from democrats demanding that the 25 tariffs on canadian products be reversed. the resolution lacks the force of law but its support from mitch mcconnell and rand paul, both of kentucky, susan collins of maine, and lisa murkowski of alaska, immediately signaled the deep misgivings among some republicans over trumps tariff gambit, which has triggered a global sell-off. mcconnell, the former senate majority leader, issued a scathing denunciation after wednesday evenings vote, calling tariffs bad policy that would trigger economic hardship. trade wars with our partners hurt working people most, he said in a statement. tariffs drive up the cost of goods and services. they are a tax on everyday working americans. further criticism came from trumps former vice-president, mike pence, who called the tariffs the largest peacetime tax hike in us history. these tariffs are nearly 10 times the size of those imposed during the trump-pence administration, and will cost american families over 3,500 per year, he posted. the four republicans who voted with democrats did so despite a public appeal from trump not to support the resolution, tabled by tim kaine, a democratic senator for virginia who was hillary clintons running mate in the 2016 presidential election, which trump won. the resolution was aimed at curtailing the powers trump claimed under the international emergency economic powers act, which he has invoked to tackle the uss 1.2tn trade deficit and, in the case of canada, cited the influx of fentanyl through its border. mcconnell pulled no punches in his attack on trumps policy. preserving the long-term prosperity of american industry and workers requires working with our allies, not against them. with so much at stake globally, the last thing we need is to pick fights with the very friends with whom we should be working with to protect against chinas predatory and unfair trade practices, he said. he added at a time when americans are tightening their belts, we would do well to avoid policies that heap on the pain. we ought to strengthen our friendships abroad, and reinforce our allies as pillars of american prosperity and security. paul, his fellow kentuckian, said the tariffs were unconstitutional. our constitution was very specific that taxes tariffs are a tax taxes originate in the house, come to the senate and then go the president, he told reporters. they dont just go to the president and no one else. what kind of system would it be if all of our taxes and laws were passed by one person? he later told fox news trade is proportional to wealth. the last 70 years of international trade has been an exponential curve upwards, and the last 70 years of prosperity has been upwards also. we are richer because of trade with canada, and so is canada. collins, the senator for maine, said tariffs would damage lobstering, agriculture and the pulp and paper industries in her state, which borders canada. she also lambasted imposing tariffs on us allies. the fact is, the vast majority of fentanyl in america comes from the southern border rather than from canada, she said on the senate floor. one of my biggest concerns is we should be distinguishing between allies and our adversaries and not treating them the same way. murkowski, a senator from alaska, said tariffs would also hurt her state and urged trump to find a better way to mutually secure our borders and address fentanyl trafficking than by starting a trade war. while not all canadian trade practices are fair, im keenly aware of the negative impacts in store for alaskan families and businesses should tariffs drive up the costs of essential goods, she posted on x. in alaska we share more than 1,538 miles of border with canada. we are friends, neighbors, partners, and allies when it comes to our economies, our mutual defense, our cultures, and, yes, our trade. the outspoken republican criticism hinted at a wider unease in the party that is mostly being kept muted for fear of repercussions from trump. thom tillis, a republican senator for north carolina, warned about potential irreparable damage to his farming constituents before wednesdays announcement. anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right need to talk to my farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy, he told cnn. they dont have time. so weve got to be crisp on this implementation. john thune, the republican senate majority leader, tried to reconcile his concerns with loyalty to trump. ive got my issue. i represent a state that is very dependent upon exports, he told reporters. but i do appreciate the presidents focus on making sure were getting better deals, and giving business an incentive to do business here in the united states. such equivocation contrasted with unambiguous condemnation from democrats, some of whom openly lauded the republican anti-tariff rebels. this is what happens when people speak up, posted the new jersey senator, cory booker, citing images of news headlines about the four senators votes and obliquely referencing his record-breaking senate floor speech this week denouncing trumps policies. chuck schumer, the democratic leader in the senate, posted 54 tariffs on china, 10 tariffs on iran, 0 tariffs on russia alongside a puzzled emoji. brian schatz, a hawaii senator and the democrats chief whip, posted ive never seen a president ruin the economy on purpose. responding, chris murphy, the outspoken connecticut senator who has emerged as an articulate advocate of the need for a democratic anti-trump fightback, wrote this is the thing to understand. its all on purpose. creating chaos and crisis.

  Title: Contributor: The Trump administration is ignoring far-right terrorism. That only makes it more dangerous
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-09 10:00:35)
  Content: intelligence chiefs testified recently on capitol hill about the u.s. intelligence communitys newly published annual threat assessment. in a stark departure from previous reports, this years assessment began with an overview of the threats posed by criminal organizations, including drug cartels and transnational gangs, before moving on to detail the challenge of countering jihadist groups like the islamic state and al qaeda and their worldwide networks. before moving on to traditional state-based threats embodied by china, iran and others, the section on nonstate actors concludes with an analysis of cybercriminals, hackers and online fraudsters using ransomware. but conspicuously absent from the report is any mention of transnational far-right extremists, including neo-nazis, white supremacists and others animated by racial or ethnic hatred. this is the same ideology promoted by anders breivik , a norwegian white supremacist who slaughtered 77 people in norway in 2011, and brenton tarrant , an australian far-right extremist who attacked two mosques in christchurch, new zealand, in 2019, killing more than 50 people and wounding more than 40 others. the decision to exclude any mention of far-right terrorism is not necessarily surprising, given president trumps support for certain political terrorists and political violence. but ignoring these threats will not make them go away. the united states is no stranger to far-right extremist terrorism, which reared its ugly head at a synagogue in pittsburgh in october 2018 again at a walmart in el paso in august 2019 and at a supermarket in a predominantly african american section of buffalo, n.y., in may 2022. the perpetrators of each of these attacks engaged with far-right propaganda online and subscribed to some version of the great replacement theory , also advocated by breivik and tarrant, which conjures a global cabal of jews and elites actively looking to replace the white christian population with ethnic and religious minorities. it should not be surprising that the first annual threat assessment from this trump administration ranks gangs and cartels as the top danger, given the presidents emphasis on deportations. but to go further by completely omitting far-right terrorists fundamentally ignores a core threat to american democracy. just a year earlier, the 2024 threat assessment explained that the transnational racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists rmve movement, in particular motivated by white supremacy, will continue to foment violence across europe, south america, australia, canada, and new zealand inspiring the lone actor or small-cell attacks that pose a significant threat to u.s. persons. theres no reason to think that threat has disappeared. while intelligence community threat assessments should always remain politically neutral, it seems evident that the trump administration put its thumb on the scale to influence the analysis, generating a result that directly reflects trumps policy priorities. more recently and at the urging of trumps consigliere du jour, the tesla chief executive elon musk those priorities have included labeling attacks against tesla dealerships as domestic terrorism. during his first term in office, trump largely ignored the threat posed by far-right extremists and suggested that he would look into designating far-left movements like antifa as terrorist organizations. a mountain of evidence shows that the threat from the far right was far more lethal. the latest intelligence community assessment follows the unprecedented decision to label mexican drug cartels and venezuelan and salvadoran gangs as foreign terrorist organizations. there is no doubt that these groups are violent and dangerous, but they are motivated by profit, not politics, and as such, are more accurately characterized as criminals, not terrorists. however, the designation of venezuelan crime ring tren de aragua as a terror group served as a controversial basis for the trump administration to use the alien enemies act to deport venezuelan nationals some of whom have been reported as having no ties to the group, and at least one of whom had legal status and was protected from deportation by a court order that the administration ignored. in his first few months in office, trump has intimidated opponents in politics and media, cowed powerful law firms and even co-opted tech titans who were once among his loudest critics. but distorting the intelligence communitys threat assessment represents a special kind of danger. one of the core aspects of the relationship between intelligence officials and policymakers in constitutional federal republics like the united states is that the intelligence community should exercise autonomy and be immune to the politics of the day. while the president has every right to reorder his priorities, the intelligence community should not weight threats more significantly based on the presidents perceptions or wishes. if our country learned anything from the iraq war debacle, its that policymakers should not influence intelligence community analysis. the danger is apparent not only in the distorted assessment but also in personnel decisions and allocation of resources. even before the white houses department of government efficiency began to jettison entire agencies of the federal government, a shift was underway in which resources and personnel were being moved away from counterterrorism and toward strategic competition with near peers like china and russia. now, almost overnight, tens of millions of dollars in funding earmarked for research studying radicalization, violent extremism and terrorism prevention has been cut. that includes a 3-million database that was maintained by researchers to track and study domestic terrorism threats. the trump administrations actions the loss of personnel and funding, the politicization of counterterrorism leave the u.s. much more vulnerable to an attack than at any time in recent memory. jason m. blazakis, a professor of practice at the middlebury institute of international studies,

  Title: Opinion: This isn’t immigration enforcement. It’s political theater. - The Salt Lake Tribune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-10 12:01:24)
  Content: federal law enforcement under president trump is engaged in dangerous political theater, with high-profile arrests of non-citizen students, workers and parents set up to score political points more than to protect national security. it is not impossible for the united states to have a humane immigration system focused on public safety that provides for the growth of the nation and local communities. ive seen those possibilities through my work in military intelligence, counterterrorism, homeland defense and cyberoperations and as the chief of staff at u.s. immigration customs and enforcement during the biden administration. border security and interior immigration are linked but separate challenges. in towns within the united states, there is an effective way to do interior immigration enforcement and protect our national security without undue emphasis on undocumented immigrants who do not have criminal convictions. right now, the government is burning thousands of federal law enforcement hours on operations that privilege political objectives over public safety, attacking constitutional protections like due process and free speech as they do. if this administration doesnt correct course, it will lock the country into a future of weaker enforcement, lowered trust in public safety officials and greater risk to americans collective safety. this is not the first administration to fail at this task. president barack obama leaned on broken enforcement policies, using deportation as a deterrent while unsuccessfully trying to reform the broader immigration enterprise. president trumps first administration implemented zero-tolerance policies that separated families, sought to end protections for children who arrived in this country as minors, prioritized draconian deterrence measures and relied on emergency public health restrictions, like title 42. the biden white house then continued to use emergency public health restrictions as a crutch to address a problem that needed a much more expansive solution. as each successive administration relied more on executive power to manage the system, congress did not pass structured, long-term immigration reform. but this moment is worse. the new trump white house is finding ever more cruel, even brutal, methods to publicly target some of the most vulnerable people in this country. while americans are distracted by sensational videos of anti-migrant enforcement actions from the trump administration on social media, the real threats grow. the homeland security secretary, kristi noem, recently announced that federal agents arrested roughly 20,000 undocumented people across the country in february. that doesnt mean 20,000 national security threats were removed from the united states. on average, the united states can deport only about 7,000 to 9,000 people monthly by plane, and detention centers were at maximum capacity. so what happened to the 13,000 other migrants who were arrested? the only rational law enforcement step would be to process and then release them. that means law enforcements time, energy and focus were wasted on a political stunt. and real people suffered. every ice agent dispatched to detain a noncriminal farmworker, construction laborer or college student many, if not most, of whom have legal standing to work and study in our communities is an ice agent not investigating fentanyl networks, cyberattacks, human trafficking or transnational gangs. those are the actual bad actors who threaten american safety and sovereignty. last month, the department of homeland security removed a maryland father to el salvador that it had no ground to deport, and despite well-documented threats against his life from local gangs. ice arrested and continues to hold in detention a tufts university student with no criminal record another case that lacks any public safety rationale. these cases send a message that law enforcement is a prop, not a protector. the machinery of federal law enforcement is powerful. thats what makes it so dangerous when misused by political opportunists. ice and u.s. customs and border protection have greater authority than most americans realize. they can detain people without a warrant, conduct searches without probable cause and deport people without criminal charges. these powers demand discipline, not spectacle. they exist to respond urgently to serious threats, prevent cross-border crime and detain individuals who pose risks when time or circumstances dont allow for traditional criminal justice processes. they do not exist to target migrant grandmothers from guatemala, unaccompanied children fleeing gang violence, haitian families seeking asylum from political collapse, palestinian and indian students who attended u.s. universities under lawful visas, or mexican and salvadoran families working and raising u.s. citizen children while trapped in immigration backlogs. over the past two decades, the united states has invested heavily in a sophisticated vetting infrastructure. it can flag threats based on identities, travel histories and behavioral patterns. its built to catch real bad actors before they can do harm. but instead of using its tools to protect children from abuse or disrupt transnational money laundering operations, they are being used to track down individuals with no criminal convictions, people who are providing our nation the benefits of their hope and hard work. when ice and c.b.p. are used in this manner, their mission is compromised. career agents are sidelined. morale drops. recruitment suffers. when communities see federal law enforcement used to punish rather than to protect, they stop cooperating. law enforcement loses tips, and witnesses. local partners hesitate to share information. thats how dangerous actors slip through. the real bad actors are getting smarter and faster. mexican cartels use tunnels and ultralight aircraft to move narcotics. cybercriminals attack hospitals and rural infrastructure. international smuggling operations launder profits through cryptocurrency. that means the best solution for public safety is not mass deportations its giving undocumented immigrants who have been in the united states for a long time the opportunity to come forward, pay a fine and gain legal status. this country needs law enforcement that goes after genuine threats, not just easy targets, and immigration enforcement that reflects who we are a nation built by immigrants and secured by law. law enforcement agents know how to do it. they built the tools. but if the current administration keeps misusing them, the people who intend to harm us will succeed. jason p. houser is a former ice chief of staff, department of homeland security counterterrorism official, afghanistan combat veteran, and u.s. cyber command liaison to israel and europe. this article originally appeared in the new york times. get the latest news by subscribing to our top stories newsletter. enter your email below to receive more stories like these right to your inbox.

  Title: How Trump Waged War on His Perceived Foes in First 100 Days
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-22 10:06:09)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article illustrates a Realist perspective on international relations applied domestically. Trump's actions, such as targeting perceived enemies and prioritizing national interests as he defines them, reflect a power-centric approach. The text states, "trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies." This demonstrates a focus on consolidating and exercising power, a core tenet of Realism.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Trump's use of executive orders to target perceived enemies, stating, "trump has made particular use of executive orders...to target perceived foes." This is intriguing because executive orders are typically used to direct policy priorities. Could this suggest a blurring of the lines between policy and personal vendettas, potentially undermining the legitimacy of the executive branch?

  Content: by joseph ax reuters -hours after swearing an oath to defend the u.s. constitution on january 20, president donald trump signed an executive order directing his attorney general to scour the justice department and other agencies for evidence of political weaponization. the same day, pentagon staff took down a portrait of mark milley, a trump critic who as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been the highest-ranking military officer during trumps first term. that evening, trump stripped his former national security adviser, john bolton - who wrote a memoir critical of trump - of the protective secret service detail he had been given after the justice department said iran had threatened boltons life. in his first 100 days, trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies. these include former intelligence officials who investigated alleged russian ties to his 2016 election campaign and major law firms as well as former biden administration members and prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against him while he was out of power. trumps actions served notice that his campaign promise of political retribution was anything but rhetorical, after he repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate. but the speed and sweep of his actions have caught many by surprise, with even the smallest slights drawing reprisals. the republican president has used the machinery of the state and the power of the presidency to go after people and institutions that have aggrieved him in more expansive ways than any of his predecessors, historians said. its not unusual for presidents to have enemies, said jeremi suri, a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin. what is unusual is for the president to use the entirety of the federal government, not simply to exclude someone, but to directly punish them. trump has made particular use of executive orders - typically used by presidents to direct policy priorities - to target perceived foes by stripping them of security clearances, blocking them from government buildings or directing agencies to probe them for wrongdoing. he has launched multiple federal probes into maine after a verbal spat with the states governor, reached deep into the traditionally independent justice department to fire those he views as disloyal, pulled protective security details from his critics and ordered investigations into former officials who challenged his false claims that his 2020 election loss was rigged. on his first day in office, he removed clearances for 50 former national security officials who had signed a letter suggesting russia was behind a story about salacious material found on a laptop belonging to president joe bidens son hunter. no evidence of russian involvement has emerged. he has also taken away clearances for all three democrats who ran against him in presidential contests biden, hillary clinton and kamala harris. trump has focused much of his attention on the criminal justice system after claiming during his 2024 presidential campaign that his four indictments were motivated by politics. then-president joe bidens administration denied the accusations. in trumps first 100 days, his justice department has fired or demoted dozens of officials, prosecutors and fbi agents, including rank-and-file employees who worked on investigations into trump and the january 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob of trump supporters. in a speech at the justice departments headquarters in february, trump denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him with illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. traditional presidencies have failed to bring meaningful change to the ways of washington, and the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy, a white house spokesman, harrison fields, said in response to questions about trumps retribution efforts and whether they represent an abuse of power. utilizing every tool afforded by the constitution, the trump administration is prioritizing efficiency eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and fulfilling every campaign promise. the ferocity and the scope during his first term, trumps instincts for revenge were sometimes thwarted by his own appointees, many of whom were experienced government hands or establishment republicans. by contrast, trump has filled his second-term administration with steadfast loyalists more likely to back his directives than caution against them. meanwhile, the republican majority in congress has shown little interest in opposing his actions. trump has taken steps as well to eliminate internal watchdogs who might seek to constrain him, purging inspectors general and firing government ethics officials. all administrations, particularly when you see a switch from one party to another, seek to control the executive branch, said historian timothy naftali, the former director of the richard nixon presidential library and museum. its the ferocity and the scope of what hes done that makes it unprecedented. the republican nixon famously had a list of enemies, but he plotted against them in secret. his most aggressive ideas, such as using the tax-collecting internal revenue service to audit his foes, were often blocked by his own officials. other presidents have used their power to penalize rivals in more muted ways, suri said. democrat lyndon johnson sought to discredit his political rival, robert kennedy, in the news media, and republican george w. bush banned brent scowcroft, a former national security adviser, from the white house after scowcroft wrote a column opposing the iraq war. thats often how presidents use their power to go after enemies they keep them out of their administration and spread rumors about them, suri said. only the beginning trump has frequently intertwined his personal animus against political opponents with his administrations ideological and policy objectives. in february, trump digressed from remarks during a white house meeting with governors to address maine governor janet mills, warning her to comply with an order banning transgender athletes. see you in court, mills, a democrat, replied defiantly. within a day, three separate federal departments had initiated inquiries into whether the state was violating civil rights law, imperiling millions of dollars in federal funding. the justice department sent mills a letter telling her maine was on notice while trump demanded a full-throated apology before the case can be settled. in early april, trumps agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, wrote mills to confirm that some school funding had been frozen. this is only the beginning, rollins warned her. nine days later, the education department said it was taking steps to cut off all federal school funding to the state, and last week attorney general pam bondi announced the justice department had sued maine in federal court. in recent weeks, trump has attacked law firms that once employed attorneys he views as enemies, arguing they undermined the judicial process by doing so. in february, he suspended security clearances for attorneys at the law firm covington burling who had represented smith, the former special counsel investigating him, and sought to cancel any government work the firm had. making little effort to hide his primary motivation, trump suggested sending the pen he used to sign the order to smith as a souvenir. trump has signed executive orders targeting five other law firms, in each case indicating that revenge was an essential factor. his order punishing wilmerhale, for instance, noted that it once employed robert mueller, who investigated whether trumps 2016 campaign had improper connections with russia. nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work on mutually agreed projects backed by the administration. in some cases, trump simply appears determined to get even with former members of his 2017-2021 administration who irked him. this month, the president ordered the justice department to investigate christopher krebs, his former cybersecurity chief who disputed trumps false claims about election fraud in 2020, and miles taylor, a former homeland security official who anonymously wrote a 2019 book critical of trump. signing the executive order targeting the two former officials, trump called taylor a traitor. i think hes guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth, but well find out, he said. dissent isnt unlawful, taylor responded on x. it certainly isnt treasonous. reporting by joseph ax editing by ross colvin and howard goller 2025 thomson reuters.

  Title: Trump’s attacks on law firms are an attack on law itself | David Cole and Amrit Singh
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-04 12:00:53)
  Content: if you are systematically engaged in lawbreaking, lawyers can be very annoying. they sue, and their suits may lead courts to declare your actions illegal. so donald trump, who has launched his second term with a blizzard of blatantly illegal actions, many of which have been suspended by the courts, has decided to address the problem at its root. hes targeting lawyers, punishing them for doing nothing more than filing lawsuits he opposes, or hiring lawyers he does not like. he has issued unprecedented executive orders penalizing five of the nations major law firms, and more are likely to come. these tactics, blatantly illegal, are designed with one goal in mind to chill lawyers willingness to challenge his illegal actions. they are a fundamental attack on the foundation of the rule of law. and they are achieving their purpose, not because they are legal they obviously are not but because too many law firms are surrendering to trumps illegal demands. these measures take a page from the book of other autocrats around the world. just last week, the turkish president recep tayyip erdoğans government detained lawyers for representing people protesting the arrest of his main political rival, istanbuls mayor. erdoğans attacks on the legal profession stretch back more than a decade. putins russia is persecuting lawyers for the late russian opposition leader alexei navalny simply for carrying out their professional duties. and in maduros venezuela, lawyers defending political detainees are being subjected to surveillance, threats, arrest and smear campaigns, increasingly leaving the detainees without access to counsel of their choice. these tactics are designed with one goal in mind to chill lawyers willingness to challenge his illegal actions trumps executive orders make no attempt to hide their unconstitutional retaliatory motive. they single out individual law firms by name, complain about the firms cases and association with individuals trump regards as his enemies, and impose a series of sanctions lifting security clearances for all their lawyers, barring federal business with them, excluding them from federal buildings which means they cant even go to court and requiring federal contractors to disclose whether they have used the firm. in an order targeting wilmerhale, one of the nations most prestigious law firms, trump complains that it hired robert mueller, the former fbi director who investigated possible russian interference in the 2016 election. another order, directed against the law firm jenner block, targets its pro bono representation of transgender individuals and immigrants. still another order punishes the law firm perkins coie for, among other things, filing suits challenging voter identification laws as impermissibly barring access to the ballot. and an executive memorandum, issued on 22 march, threatens to sanction lawyers and their firms including in particular those at the immigration bar who litigate against the federal government. the order directs the attorney general to review all lawsuits against the federal government over the past eight years and going forward, and to recommend to trump sanctions against lawyers or firms involved in cases the attorney general deems frivolous. these orders are blatantly unconstitutional. filing lawsuits to vindicate voting rights, lgbtq equality or fair treatment of immigrants is protected by the first amendment, which guarantees the right to petition for a redress of grievances. and law firms also have a first amendment right to choose whom to hire as partners, regardless of what trump thinks of their lawyering skills. the orders are classic government retaliation for the exercise of first amendment rights. wilmerhale, jenner and perkins coie each immediately challenged the orders in federal court, and in each case judges have blocked the order the day the suit was filed. the government has no even colorable defense for what the president is doing. but, disturbingly, four other major firms paul weiss, skadden arps, milbank and willkie farr have succumbed to trumps illegal demands, the latter three even before an executive order was issued against them. shockingly, each firm has agreed to commit millions of dollars in pro bono work to causes that trump supports, as well as accepting lawless intrusions on their hiring and employment practices. the firms could have sued, and would certainly have prevailed had they done so, for the same reasons the other three firms won. no judge would uphold such orders. but the firms chose instead to compromise, fearing that, even if they won in court, they would lose in the market, as clients who needed to do business with the federal government would abandon them for firms that had not been placed on trumps enemies list. they put their considerable take-home pay over their principles and have been roundly and justly criticized within the legal community for having done so. this is precisely the kind of anticipatory obedience that the yale historian timothy snyder and new york times columnist m gessen warn marks the beginning of autocratic takeovers. if the united states is to be governed by the rule of law, lawyers and law firms cannot bow down to such unlawful assaults on the legal professions independence. their duties as officers of the court require them to stand and fight. if lawyers are afraid to challenge unlawful actions by the administration, trump will be free to act extra-legally. it has long been a bedrock of the american system that anyone harmed by official action can challenge that action in court, even where the official is the president himself. but that depends on lawyers maintaining their independence. trumps first two months have seen widespread attacks on those most vulnerable immigrants, transgender individuals and members of other minority groups. lawyers and big corporate law firms are not exactly the vulnerable themselves. trump is attacking them because they can defend the vulnerable, and block his illegal actions in court. his executive orders have in particular objected to the firms pro bono work, done without fee, for indigent clients, often seeking to hold the government accountable. one by one, trump is picking off his potential opposition, publicly reveling in its growing acquiescence. as each law firm folds, looking only to its own bottom line, it undermines not only its own standing, but the legal profession itself. by contrast, the three law firms who have challenged trumps executive orders and the lawyers who have taken on their cases are fighting not only for their own rights, but for the rule of law. their principled resistance is precisely what we need if the united states is to remain a constitutional democracy.

  Title: 100 DAYS OF PUNISHING FOES...
  Source: www.msn.com (2025-04-22 15:37:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article demonstrates how Trump actively shapes the public's perception by prioritizing certain narratives (e.g., 'political weaponization,' 'lies and abuses') and repeatedly emphasizing them. The text states Trump 'repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate' and 'denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him.' This constant reinforcement influences which issues voters deem important, potentially overshadowing other concerns.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights the speed and scope of Trump's actions, noting that 'even the smallest slights drawing reprisals.' This suggests a potential underlying mechanism of personal vendettas driving policy decisions, raising questions about the stability and predictability of the administration's actions. What are the long-term consequences of such personalized governance?; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that 'nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work.' This raises questions about the ethical implications of such arrangements and whether they constitute a form of extortion or coercion. Does this set a dangerous precedent for future interactions between the government and private entities?

  Content: reuters -hours after swearing an oath to defend the u.s. constitution on january 20, president donald trump signed an executive order directing his attorney general to scour the justice department and other agencies for evidence of political weaponization. the same day, pentagon staff took down a portrait of mark milley, a trump critic who as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been the highest-ranking military officer during trumps first term. that evening, trump stripped his former national security adviser, john bolton - who wrote a memoir critical of trump - of the protective secret service detail he had been given after the justice department said iran had threatened boltons life. in his first 100 days, trump has wielded the levers of presidential power against a panoply of perceived enemies. these include former intelligence officials who investigated alleged russian ties to his 2016 election campaign and major law firms as well as former biden administration members and prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against him while he was out of power. trumps actions served notice that his campaign promise of political retribution was anything but rhetorical, after he repeatedly telegraphed his intentions as a candidate. but the speed and sweep of his actions have caught many by surprise, with even the smallest slights drawing reprisals. the republican president has used the machinery of the state and the power of the presidency to go after people and institutions that have aggrieved him in more expansive ways than any of his predecessors, historians said. its not unusual for presidents to have enemies, said jeremi suri, a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin. what is unusual is for the president to use the entirety of the federal government, not simply to exclude someone, but to directly punish them. trump has made particular use of executive orders - typically used by presidents to direct policy priorities - to target perceived foes by stripping them of security clearances, blocking them from government buildings or directing agencies to probe them for wrongdoing. he has launched multiple federal probes into maine after a verbal spat with the states governor, reached deep into the traditionally independent justice department to fire those he views as disloyal, pulled protective security details from his critics and ordered investigations into former officials who challenged his false claims that his 2020 election loss was rigged. on his first day in office, he removed clearances for 50 former national security officials who had signed a letter suggesting russia was behind a story about salacious material found on a laptop belonging to president joe bidens son hunter. no evidence of russian involvement has emerged. he has also taken away clearances for all three democrats who ran against him in presidential contests biden, hillary clinton and kamala harris. trump has focused much of his attention on the criminal justice system after claiming during his 2024 presidential campaign that his four indictments were motivated by politics. then-president joe bidens administration denied the accusations. in trumps first 100 days, his justice department has fired or demoted dozens of officials, prosecutors and fbi agents, including rank-and-file employees who worked on investigations into trump and the january 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob of trump supporters. in a speech at the justice departments headquarters in february, trump denounced the lies and abuses that he said had led special counsel jack smith to charge him with illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. traditional presidencies have failed to bring meaningful change to the ways of washington, and the president is committed to upending the entrenched bureaucracy, a white house spokesman, harrison fields, said in response to questions about trumps retribution efforts and whether they represent an abuse of power. utilizing every tool afforded by the constitution, the trump administration is prioritizing efficiency eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse and fulfilling every campaign promise. the ferocity and the scope during his first term, trumps instincts for revenge were sometimes thwarted by his own appointees, many of whom were experienced government hands or establishment republicans. by contrast, trump has filled his second-term administration with steadfast loyalists more likely to back his directives than caution against them. meanwhile, the republican majority in congress has shown little interest in opposing his actions. trump has taken steps as well to eliminate internal watchdogs who might seek to constrain him, purging inspectors general and firing government ethics officials. all administrations, particularly when you see a switch from one party to another, seek to control the executive branch, said historian timothy naftali, the former director of the richard nixon presidential library and museum. its the ferocity and the scope of what hes done that makes it unprecedented. the republican nixon famously had a list of enemies, but he plotted against them in secret. his most aggressive ideas, such as using the tax-collecting internal revenue service to audit his foes, were often blocked by his own officials. other presidents have used their power to penalize rivals in more muted ways, suri said. democrat lyndon johnson sought to discredit his political rival, robert kennedy, in the news media, and republican george w. bush banned brent scowcroft, a former national security adviser, from the white house after scowcroft wrote a column opposing the iraq war. thats often how presidents use their power to go after enemies they keep them out of their administration and spread rumors about them, suri said. trump has frequently intertwined his personal animus against political opponents with his administrations ideological and policy objectives. in february, trump digressed from remarks during a white house meeting with governors to address maine governor janet mills, warning her to comply with an order banning transgender athletes. see you in court, mills, a democrat, replied defiantly. within a day, three separate federal departments had initiated inquiries into whether the state was violating civil rights law, imperiling millions of dollars in federal funding. the justice department sent mills a letter telling her maine was on notice while trump demanded a full-throated apology before the case can be settled. in early april, trumps agriculture secretary, brooke rollins, wrote mills to confirm that some school funding had been frozen. this is only the beginning, rollins warned her. nine days later, the education department said it was taking steps to cut off all federal school funding to the state, and last week attorney general pam bondi announced the justice department had sued maine in federal court. in recent weeks, trump has attacked law firms that once employed attorneys he views as enemies, arguing they undermined the judicial process by doing so. in february, he suspended security clearances for attorneys at the law firm covington burling who had represented smith, the former special counsel investigating him, and sought to cancel any government work the firm had. making little effort to hide his primary motivation, trump suggested sending the pen he used to sign the order to smith as a souvenir. trump has signed executive orders targeting five other law firms, in each case indicating that revenge was an essential factor. his order punishing wilmerhale, for instance, noted that it once employed robert mueller, who investigated whether trumps 2016 campaign had improper connections with russia. nine law firms have cut deals with trump to avoid punishment, promising nearly 1 billion in pro bono work on mutually agreed projects backed by the administration. in some cases, trump simply appears determined to get even with former members of his 2017-2021 administration who irked him. this month, the president ordered the justice department to investigate christopher krebs, his former cybersecurity chief who disputed trumps false claims about election fraud in 2020, and miles taylor, a former homeland security official who anonymously wrote a 2019 book critical of trump. signing the executive order targeting the two former officials, trump called taylor a traitor. i think hes guilty of treason, if you want to know the truth, but well find out, he said. dissent isnt unlawful, taylor responded on x. it certainly isnt treasonous. reporting by

  Title: Trump Advisers Say 50-Plus Countries Have Reached Out for Tariff Talks With White House
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-06 18:32:26)
  Content: fort lauderdale, fla. ap top administration officials said sunday that more than 50 countries targeted by president donald trumps new tariffs have reached out to begin negotiations over the sweeping import taxes that have sent financial markets reeling, raised fears of a recession and upended the global trading system. the higher rates are set to be collected beginning wednesday, ushering in a new era of economic uncertainty with no clear end in sight. treasury secretary scott bessent said unfair trade practices are not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks. the united states, he said, must see what the countries offer and whether its believable. trump, who spent the weekend in florida playing golf, posted online that we will win. hang tough, it wont be easy. his cabinet members and economic advisers were out in force sunday defending the tariffs and downplaying the consequences for the global economy. there doesnt have to be a recession. who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week? bessent said. what we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity. trumps tariff blitz, announced april 2, fulfilled a key campaign promise as he acted without congress to redraw the rules of global trade. it was a move decades in the making for trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the u.s. he is gambling that voters will be willing to endure higher prices for everyday items to enact his economic vision. countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with china and others retaliating quickly. top white house economic adviser kevin hassett acknowledged that other countries are angry and retaliating, and, he said, by the way, coming to the table. he cited the office of the u.s. trade representative as reporting that more than 50 nations had reached out to the white house to begin talks. adding to the turmoil, the new tariffs are hitting american allies and adversaries alike, including israel, which is facing a 17 tariff. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is set to visit the white house monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion with trump along with the war in gaza and other issues. another american ally, vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs. trump said vietnams leader said in a telephone call that his country wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the u.s. and a key european partner, italian premier giorgia meloni, said she disagreed with trumps move but was ready to deploy all the tools negotiating and economic necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized. commerce secretary howard lutnick made clear there was no postponing tariffs that are days away. the tariffs are coming. of course they, he said, adding that trump needed to reset global trade. but he committed only to having them definitely remain for days and weeks. in congress, where trumps republican party has long championed free trade, the tariff regiment has been met with applause but also significant unease. several republican senators have already signed onto a new bipartisan bill that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to congress. lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. wyomings john barrasso, the no. 2 member of the senates gop leadership, said trump is doing what he has every right to do. but, he acknowledged, there is concern, and theres concern across the country. people are watching the markets. therell be a discussion in the senate, barrasso said of the tariffs. well see which way the discussion goes. trumps government cost-cutting guru, billionaire businessman elon musk, had been relatively silent on trumps tariffs, but said at a weekend event in italy that he would like to see the u.s. and europe move to a zero-tariff situation. the comment from the tesla owner who leads trumps department of government efficiency drew a rebuke from white house trade adviser peter navarro. elon, when he is on his doge lane, is great. but we understand whats going on here. we just have to understand. elon sells cars, navarro said. he added hes simply protecting his own interest as any business person would do. lawrence summers, an economist who was treasury secretary under democratic president bill clinton, said trump and his economic team are sending contradictory messages if they say they are interested in reviving manufacturing while still being open to negotiating with trade partners. if other countries eliminate their tariffs, and the u.s, does, too, he said, its just making a deal, then we dont raise any revenue nor do we get any businesses to relocate to the united states. if its a permanent revenue source and trying to get businesses to relocate to the united states, then were going to have these tariffs permanently. so the president cant have it both ways. bessent was on nbcs meet the press, hassett and summers appeared on abcs this week, lutnick and barrasso were on cbs face the nation and navarro was interviewed on fox news channels sunday morning futures. ______ associated press writers giada zampano in rome and fatima hussein in jupiter, florida, contributed to this report. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: WALL AGAINST WORLD...
  Source: english.elpais.com (2025-04-02 22:07:36)
  Content: white house press secretary karoline leavitt during a news conference at the white house on tuesday. evan vucci ap tariffs are a tax on your grocery bill, announced billboards paid for by the government of canada on the streets of washington this week. meanwhile, television stations are broadcasting messages by toyota in which the japanese company emphasizes how american it is. the skirmishes have already begun, but the official declaration of trade war is expected this wednesday in the white house rose garden, in a solemn ceremony for what the u.s. president pompously calls liberation day. donald trump will erect a wall against imports with tariffs that aim to exceed 20 on average, although the final details have not been revealed. trump had already said at a rally that november 5, the day of the presidential election, would be liberation day. then, on his inauguration day, he proclaimed that for the american people, january 20, 2025, is liberation day. so this is at least the third liberation day in six months. as on the previous two occasions, the world is watching washington with bated breath. the president has promised to impose what he inaccurately calls reciprocal tariffs this wednesday. in theory, it is to punish countries that impose higher tariffs on the u.s. than those the u.s. imposes on them. in practice, trump is merely targeting countries that sell more to the u.s. than they buy from it. the last time washington embarked on a relatively comparable wave of protectionism was almost a century ago, with the smoot-hawley tariffs of 1930, and the result was disastrous. the trade war contributed to the great depression, and widespread tariffs were discredited. trump points even further back, to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as an example of a period when the u.s. economy grew strongly despite high tariffs. economists note that the country currently practicing an import-substitution trade policy most similar to the one trump appears to advocate is india. the republican president aims to turn tariffs into a permanent and significant source of revenue and to boost domestic production by penalizing foreign production. the two objectives are somewhat incompatible for there to be a lot of revenue, there must continue to be a lot of imports, and if there are a lot of imports, it will be because they havent been replaced with domestic production. the squaring of this circle is completed by those who claim that the exchange rate adjustment will keep products from becoming more expensive for americans but, in that case, it would not incentivize import substitution. for now, trumps announcements and measures have weakened the u.s. economy. growth prospects have deteriorated, increasing the risk of a recession, while inflation expectations have soared, complicating the federal reserves roadmap. in 2019, during trumps much smaller first trade war, the federal reserve concluded that the impact of uncertainty on slowing investment and hiring was greater than the direct effect of tariffs. this time, uncertainty is greater, given the presidents erratic behavior and the chaotic implementation of his measures. workers pack avocados for export in peribán, mexico. ivan arias reuters the trade war will hamper global growth, with almost guaranteed recessions for mexico and canada and, at the very least, stagnation in the european union. the markets have felt the blow early. investors have taken refuge in gold. wednesdays announcements will be made starting at 400 p.m. local time in washington, after the close of trading on wall street. the trade war is about moving from a rules-based global trading system to one built on deals. the problem is that trump doesnt respect the agreements he signs. during his first term, he negotiated the u.s.-mexico-canada agreement usmca, which he praised without hesitation, but which he has now ruthlessly scuttled. the white house has been discussing until the last minute the details of what it will announce this wednesday. there are no objective criteria for penalizing imports from one country or another. the decision ultimately stems from the whim of trump, a president who has embarked on an authoritarian drift, governing by executive decree beyond his constitutional powers. in recent days, trump has said he will be lenient with his tariffs, but the u.s. president is accustomed to living with constant lies. one of his top advisors on the matter, peter navarro, stated over the weekend that the government expects to raise 600 billion annually from tariffs. considering that u.s. imports were 3.3 trillion in 2024 and that tariffs would reduce them, that figure would only be achievable with average tariffs above 20. a maximum scenario considered by bloomberg raises them to 35, from the 2.4 they were at in 2024. the answer may not even be known this wednesday. the idea is to announce a tariff applicable to each country or each trading bloc, although the latter is also unclear. this reciprocal tariff is supposed to condense into a single figure all of each countrys protectionist measures, including tariffs and non-tariff barriers, whether fiscal, regulatory, or monetary. trump baselessly considers value-added taxes a protectionist measure, which already conditions, for example, tariffs on the european union. its also not entirely clear when the new tariffs will be implemented. my understanding is that the tariff announcement will come tomorrow. they will be effective immediately, and the president has been teasing this for quite some time, white house spokeswoman karoline leavitt said at a press conference on tuesday, but events often prove her wrong. some members of trumps cabinet have indicated that negotiations with various countries would be possible after the announcement, and leavitt herself admits that this is a possibility. the president is always open to a phone call, always open to a good negotiation, she said tuesday. new cars at a logistics center in duisburg, germany. martin meissner ap trump has already imposed 25 tariffs on many imports from canada and mexico, which the president says are aimed at cracking down on immigration and fentanyl smuggling. china has also been hit with 20 tariffs, ostensibly for not doing enough to stop exports of fentanyl precursors to mexico, canada, and the u.s. he has also begun imposing 25 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. he has additionally imposed a 25 tariff on imported cars, effective thursday, and on car components this one taking effect a month later. furthermore, the president has spoken at various times about his plans to impose tariffs on oil, copper, lumber, agricultural products, microprocessors, and pharmaceuticals the latter coming very soon, among other sector-specific levies. he is also considering imposing a 25 tariff on all imports from countries that buy venezuelan oil in this case, he has delegated the decision to his secretary of state, marco rubio, but it is unknown when this will be implemented. also on the horizon is the possibility of retaliation against countries that impose a google tax or impose content moderation policies on social media. the trade war also has geopolitical implications, not only because trump uses tariffs as a tool of blackmail to achieve his foreign policy objectives, but because it accentuates a distrust of his allies that has already been evident in other areas. the long-standing relationship we had with the united states, based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation, is over, canadian prime minister mark carney proclaimed last week, in what sounded like an epitaph for an era. sign up for our
