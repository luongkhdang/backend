  Title: Supreme Court hears clash over gay storybooks...
  Source: abcnews.go.com (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights how the Montgomery County school board's decision to include LGBTQ-themed storybooks in the curriculum has brought the issue of parental rights and religious freedom to the forefront of public discourse. The article states, "starting in 2022, montgomery county - one of the most diverse counties in the country - introduced a series of lgbtq-themed storybooks for reading in elementary school classrooms under a statewide mandate to be more inclusive of the diversity of families and children attending the schools." This action has set the agenda for debate, forcing the Supreme Court to address the conflict between religious beliefs and inclusive education.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that the Trump administration "moves to empower parents and root out diversity and inclusion initiatives across the u.s. education system." This suggests a broader political agenda at play. What other policies or actions might the Trump administration have taken to influence education, and how might these actions be connected to the current case before the Supreme Court?

and that the constitution does not guarantee students the right to skip lessons inconsistent with their beliefs. lower courts sided with the board. the justices will now take a closer look at whether the countys refusal to grant an opt-out to parents illegally burdens their religious rights. school districts nationwide are grappling with demands from parents to opt-out their children from lesson plans they claim are counter to religious beliefs. abc news the case is a good illustration of the fact that public schools are at ground zero in the culture wars, said jim walsh, a texas lawyer who represents school boards and is a member of the national school attorneys association. we all want the school to reflect our values, but we dont agree on our values. and certainly issues about same-sex marriage, the rights of lesbians and gays, are right at the center of that, he said. starting in 2022, montgomery county - one of the most diverse counties in the country - introduced a series of lgbtq-themed storybooks for reading in elementary school classrooms under a statewide mandate to be more inclusive of the diversity of families and children attending the schools. montgomery county, md., is at the center of a supreme court battle over lgbtq storybooks and some parents claims of a constitutional right to opt-out their children from readings. abc news the local school board, which closely consulted with educators in approving the curriculum, maintains that the books do not take a side on issues of gender or sexuality and that teachers are instructed not to teach or enforce any particular view. among the illustrated titles is uncle bobbys wedding by sarah brannen, about a young girl who worries her close relationship with a beloved uncle will change after he marries his male fiance. prince knight by daniel haack presents a fairy-tale narrative about a blossoming romance between the main characters after a dramatic rescue from a dragon. daniel haack is the author of prince knight, an illustrated childrens book featuring gay characters. abc news nothing in my book is any different than most fairy tales that have some sort of romance at the center of it, said haack. nothing different than sleeping beauty or cinderella or any of those. in the book intersection allies, a group of three sociologist authors set out to simplify complex ideas about identity, including what it means to be nonbinary. we wrote this to affirm kids who are left out of the stories that we often tell, said latoya council, one of the authors. this book is not saying that, you know, your child has to choose to be transgender. its saying respect someone who is trans and their ability to seek spaces that are comfortable for them. three sociologists and authors of the childrens book intersection allies chelsea johnson, latoya council, carolyn choi speak with abc news about their desire to simplify complex ideas about identity. abc news chelsea johnson, another of the books authors, insisted nothing in the text asks anyone to change their beliefs. schools and parents and communities are partners with each other and helping kids make sense of the world and we dont have to opt our kids out to do that. montgomery county guidelines advise educators to make the storybooks available for students to read on their own, to read aloud, or share in reading groups. teachers are instructed not to advance a particular viewpoint about sexuality or gender with respect to the characters. at first, during the 2022-2023 school year, the board allowed parents to opt-out their kids from any lessons involving the books, but it later changed course, denying any opt-outs. billy moges, a mother of 3 and devout christian, says she withdrew her children from montgomery county, md., public schools over administrators refusal to let them opt-out from the reading of storybooks involving lgbtq themes. abc news when i was in school, i was opted-out of sex ed because i wasnt ready, and my parents didnt feel it was appropriate for the teachers to talk about it, and it didnt hurt anyone, said billy moges, a mother of three and devout christian, who pulled her kids from montgomery county schools because of the books. the problem with some of these books, though, as well, is they were love stories, so it was not just exposure to lgbtq characters. these were love stories, said elkoshairi. school officials explained in court documents that administering an opt-out program became too cumbersome to manage, led to higher rates of student absenteeism, and was ultimately inconsistent with an educational mission of supporting all types of families. emily and sharon mcgowan of montgomery county, md., have a second and sixth-grader enrolled in public schools. abc news these books are representing the community that is surrounding these children, said emily mcgowan, who mothers second- and sixth-graders with her wife sharon in montgomery county. you cannot deny that we exist. we live here, our kids go to school here. the mcgowans say opt-outs over lgbtq stories harm the children whose family lives are represented in the books. the idea that 10 of their classmates get to get up and walk out because theres two mommies in this book - what is the message thats sent to our kid who has two mommies? said sharon mcgowan. that something is so offensive about this that they get to walk out and maybe they even get to go to the playground and have extra play time? nearly every state gives parents the ability to opt-out their children from sex education classes but opt-outs for lgbtq issues vary widely by community and are often decided by board members elected by local parents, walsh said. the supreme court is seen in washington, jan. 10, 2025. abc news we can all understand parents having strong feelings about when and how is my child going to be taught about sexual issues. so, there are more opt-outs about this than anything else. but if the supreme court rules in favor of the plaintiffs in this case, its not gonna stop with just sex and gender issues. it will cover a wide variety of things that parents may have objections to, he said. the case comes as the trump administration has vowed to give more control over education to local leaders and communities. but even in places where school boards are choosing to prioritize diversity, equity and inclusion in their curriculum - like montgomery county - some conservatives are still pushing to override policies. sarah brannen is the author of uncle bobbys wedding, an illustrated childrens book featuring a gay couple and their niece. abc news the school board has decided to disrupt the thinking of their children on an area that has long been understood as going to the core of parental authority for their children, on sex and gender, said will haun, a senior attorney at becket fund for religious liberty, which is representing the plaintiffs before the supreme court. in that area, the first amendment absolutely protects the parents. the democratic process is important, and thats where we debate curriculum, haun added, but here were talking about restoring an opt-out right, which is not a challenge to the curriculum. wael elkoshairi insists he harbors no ill will toward lgbtq families and says he isnt calling for a ban on any books. but he hopes the high court - as a matter of faith - will give parents greater control. wael elkosairi is among hundreds of montgomery county, md., parents of public school children hoping the u.s. supreme court will establish a constitutional right to opt-out of lessons that conflict with religious beliefs. abc news when people have differences of opinion on certain things, accommodations work well to relieve everybody, and we move on, elkosairi said. as for the mcgowans, they are hoping the courts conservative majority holds the line. the fact that the court took the case at all - i dont have reason to believe that they took the case to affirm the importance of inclusion in the public schools, said sharon mcgowan. if harm is done by their decision, we will figure out what we need to do at a personal and a community level to mitigate that harm. people walk past the u.s. supreme court, in washington, april 21, 2025. abc news a decision in the case is expected by the end of june.

  Title: Is AppLovin Corporation (APP) Among the Best Guru Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts?
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-23 17:05:39)
  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. we recently published a list of 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. in this article, we are going to take a look at where applovin corporation nasdaqapp stands against other guru stocks to invest in. wall street seems to be breathing a little easier after the initial panic over president trumps tariffs earlier this month, but the rollercoaster is not over just yet. all three major indexes closed last week in the red, with the dow and nasdaq both dipping over 2, and the broader market down more than 1. even though markets remain closed on april 18 for good friday, the general consensus is that the worst of the trade war headlines might be dying down. marko papic, chief strategist of geomacro strategy at bca research, remains cautiously optimistic, noting that while the idea of president trump striking 90 trade deals in 90 days sounds ambitious, they will likely be small, symbolic wins that still help calm markets. that said, volatility is expected to continue, and papic predicts the broader market could dip again before bouncing back, potentially giving investors a buying opportunity. investors are deep in earnings season right now, and some of wall streets biggest banks have reported solid first-quarter results. a big part of their success came from their trading desks, which cashed in on the recent market volatility, especially in equities. however, despite strong numbers on paper, bank ceos remain cautious and are hesitant to make big moves right now because of the market uncertainty. the us dollar also just had its worst weekly performance since 2022. meanwhile, investors are playing it safe and rapidly buying bonds, which pushed the 10-year treasury yield down to around 4.28. while some investors are seeing the current market dip as a buying opportunity, daniel von ahlen from globaldata ts lombard says otherwise. he believes the risks of a recession are being seriously underestimated. even though trumps recent tariff halt gave markets a bit of a boost, ahlen thinks that bounce will not last. in his view, this is not the time to scoop up stocks on the cheap, he is actually advising people to sell into rallies and avoid the usual buy-the-dip strategy. ahlen suggests getting a bit more cautious and selective. instead of jumping into the whole market, he recommends focusing on defensive sectors, like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare, that tend to hold up better in downturns. the market uncertainty is reflected in etfs as well, which are often considered wiser investment options due to active management strategies and lower risk compared to individual investing. for example, the guru etf is down 8.30 year-to-date as of april 18. however, over the last 12 months, the fund has posted share price returns of 13.38. similarly, five-year share returns stand at an impressive 51.57. guru gives retail investors a way to tap into the top stock picks of major hedge funds at a relatively low 0.75 expense ratio. it offers a more affordable and flexible way to try and beat the broader market using expert insights. so, lets take a look at the best guru stocks to buy. a close-up of a mobile device, showing an advertiser reaching out to a consumer via a software-based platform. for this article, we looked up the guru etf, which had 82 holdings as of april 18. next, we manually searched for the average upside potential of each stock and selected 11 stocks with the highest values. the list below is ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of april 18. we have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment as of q4 2024. why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? the reason is simple our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. our quarterly newsletters strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4 since may 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points see more details here. number of hedge fund holders 95 average upside potential 95.66 applovin corporation nasdaqapp is a california-based tech company that allows advertisers to grow and monetize their content through software tools. the company connects advertisers with app publishers, runs real-time auctions to get the best ad placements, and provides data and insights to help improve marketing strategies. it also supports connected tv advertising and distributes streaming content. it is one of the best guru stocks to look out for. on april 11, ubs analyst chris kuntarich assigned a buy rating to applovin corporation nasdaqapp but reduced the price target to 450 from 630. ubs is still confident in the companys future, even after a short report raised some concerns and made e-commerce advertisers a bit more cautious. while first-quarter revenue might fall short of expectations, feedback on the companys performance has been positive. ubs believes applovins advertising business could grow by more than 40 annually over the next few years. applovin corporation nasdaqapp recorded 1.37 billion in q4 revenue, a 44 jump from last year, and 4.71 billion for the full year, up 43. most of that growth came from advertising, which surged 73, while app revenue dipped slightly. net income climbed a whopping 248 in q4 and 343 for the year. looking ahead, applovin expects q1 2025 revenue to reach up to 1.385 billion. it also repurchased 25.7 million shares in 2024, ending the year with 340 million shares outstanding. according to insider monkeys fourth quarter database, 95 hedge funds were bullish on applovin corporation nasdaqapp, up from 51 funds in the prior quarter. rajiv jains gqg partners was the largest stakeholder of the company, with 8.4 million shares worth 2.7 billion. overall, app ranks 8th among the 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. while we acknowledge the potential of app as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that ai stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. there is an ai stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular ai stocks lost around 25. if you are looking for an ai stock that is more promising than app but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest ai stock. read next 20 best ai stocks to buy now and 30 best stocks to buy now according to billionaires. disclosure none. this article is originally published at insider monkey.

  Title: Pope Francis’ conservative critics had a unique way to oppose him: a retired pontiff
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-22 16:36:55)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant here. The article highlights how Pope Francis's critics actively worked to shape the narrative surrounding his papacy, using various platforms like social media and conferences. 'From individual protests to social media campaigns, conferences and petitions, conservatives made clear they believed themselves to be more catholic than the pope and forged unusually vocal resistance to his authority.' This demonstrates an attempt to influence public perception and potentially sway future papal elections.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Francis's tolerance of right-wing opposition, even seeming to 'relish in the criticism as evidence of how far a church obsessed with rules and regulations had strayed from jesus gospel-mandated call.' This raises the question: Was this tolerance genuine, or a calculated strategy to highlight the perceived rigidity of his opposition and further legitimize his reforms?

    - College of Cardinals:
      > Snippet: their token leaders in the college of cardinals will likely be maneuvering to ensure someone more sympathetic to their sensibilities will be elected to replace francis, who died monday at 88.
  Content: vatican city ap as amazonian bishops gathered at the vatican on oct. 21, 2019, a man entered a nearby church after dawn and stole three indigenous statues brought to rome for the occasion. he threw them into the tiber river in a videotaped protest to denounce what he called the pagan idolatry taking place on pope francis watch. the incident underscored the lengths to which pope francis traditionalist critics were willing to go to vent their opposition to historys first latin american pope. from individual protests to social media campaigns, conferences and petitions, conservatives made clear they believed themselves to be more catholic than the pope and forged unusually vocal resistance to his authority. their token leaders in the college of cardinals will likely be maneuvering to ensure someone more sympathetic to their sensibilities will be elected to replace francis, who died monday at 88. some wanted me dead every pope has his critics. and francis probably expected he would face opposition to his radical reform agenda after catholics for two generations grew used to more conservative popes. some wanted me dead, he quipped once after he heard some prelates in rome had started plotting a future conclave while he was in the hospital. francis critics were unique in having a living alternate as a point of reference, pope benedict xvi, who resided as pope emeritus in the vatican gardens for the first decade of francis pontificate. such an anomaly made the dynamics of the francis opposition a historical first. it exacerbated divisions that experts say must be addressed before another pope decides to step down. they say norms are necessary to prevent a retired pope from being an inspiration for the faithful in ways that discredit his successor or impact his leadership. francis tolerated the right-wing opposition for a while, often responding to their attacks with silence. at times, he even seemed to relish in the criticism as evidence of how far a church obsessed with rules and regulations had strayed from jesus gospel-mandated call to welcome the stranger, feed the poor and show mercy to all. its an honor if the americans attack me, he once said, referring to the u.s.-based nexus of opposition. after benedicts death in 2022, francis tried to blunt the opposition and consolidate his progressive reforms, even though it seemed the right-wing knives were out for him. within days of benedicts funeral, his longtime secretary published a tell-all memoir highly critical of francis. it also emerged posthumously that cardinal george pell wrote a devastating memo that circulated anonymously, calling francis pontificate a catastrophe. while saying he welcomed criticism, francis tried to neutralize the opposition through key appointments and targeted removals, even while trying to make the church a welcoming field hospital for wounded souls, especially lgbtq catholics. after one gesture of outreach francis approved blessings for same-sex couples african bishops united in disapproval in a remarkable continent-wide dissent to a papal directive. if you look at all the history of the reform of the church, where you have the strongest resistance or debated points, its really usually a very important point, said sister nathalie becquart, who helped spearhead one of francis progressive agenda items to make the church more responsive to the needs of laypeople. wary of francis from the start conservative and traditionalist catholics were wary of francis after their beloved benedict became the first pope in 600 years to resign. they grimaced when francis emerged on the loggia of st. peters basilica after his 2013 election without the ermine-rimmed, red velvet cape of his predecessors. they gasped a few weeks later when he washed the feet of women and muslims on holy thursday, a ritual previously restricted to men. we dont like this pope, headlined italys conservative daily il foglio a few months into his papacy. the dictator pope was the title of book by a british traditionalist published a few years later. over time, the critics worst fears came true. one breaking point came in 2016, when francis opened the door to letting divorced and civilly remarried catholics receive communion. some accused francis of heresy. four conservative cardinals formally asked him to clarify himself, issuing dubia or questions to him. they argued church doctrine held that catholics who remarried without a church annulment were living in sin and couldnt receive the sacraments. he never replied. reversing benedict on the latin mass conservatives could not have known that francis would take one of the most controversial steps of his pontificate by reimposing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass that benedict had relaxed. the reversal of benedicts signature liturgical legacy was evidence that francis had essentially declared war on traditionalists, the ancient liturgy and benedicts papacy itself. francis hates us. francis hates tradition. francis hates all that is good and beautiful, the traditionalist blog rorate caeli tweeted. but it concluded francis will die, the latin mass will live forever. francis insisted his aim was to preserve church unity. critics accused him of the opposite, of driving a wedge, and the outrage wasnt limited to u.s.-based conservative catholic media or fringe right-wing bloggers who had popularized francis-bashing. cardinal raymond burke, one of the dubia prelates whom francis sacked early on as the vaticans supreme court justice, blasted the severity of the papal crackdown. guinean cardinal robert sarah, the vaticans retired liturgy chief, responded with tweets quoting benedicts original 2007 law to relax the restrictions that francis had overturned. they were accompanied by a photo of benedict wearing the red cape that francis had eschewed the night of his election. a year earlier, sarah orchestrated a media firestorm by persuading benedict to co-author a book reaffirming priestly celibacy at a time when francis was considering ordaining married men to address a clergy shortage in the amazon. the book, and the prospect of a retired pope trying to influence a reigning one, created the nightmare scenario that canon lawyers and theologians had warned of in 2013, when benedict decided to retain the white cassock of the papacy in retirement and call himself emeritus pope, rather than revert to his birth name. the scandal died down after benedict removed himself as a co-author and francis fired his secretary, archbishop georg gaenswein, believed to have been behind it. after benedict died and gaenswein penned his highly critical, tell-all memoir nothing but the truth, francis exiled him from the vatican. then, after a time in his native germany, made him an ambassador. after burke joined a bigger group of cardinals questioning francis 2023 synod on the churchs future, francis cut him off financially. francis was more tolerant with another critic, the retired archbishop of hong kong, cardinal joseph zen. he excoriated the pope for agreeing in 2018 to a deal with china over the nomination of bishops, accusing francis of selling out chinas underground catholics who stayed loyal to the holy see during decades of persecution. francis received zen at the vatican and later called him a tender soul. francis won few friends with his frequent denunciations of clericalism the idea that priests should be put on a pedestal. he made it a tradition to use his christmas greeting to publicly shame vatican bureaucrats, accusing them of being careerist, money-grubbing gossips with spiritual alzheimers. german cardinal gerhard mueller complained that francis treated vatican monsignors like uneducated children. a major u.s. critic emerges francis biggest conservative critic was the vaticans former ambassador to the u.s., archbishop carlo maria vigano. in 2018, he said francis had covered up accusations that then-cardinal theodore mccarrick, an american, had slept with his seminarians. vigano demanded francis resign for allegedly rehabilitating mccarrick from sanctions imposed by benedict. the furor faded after francis defrocked mccarrick and vigano was discredited with conspiracy theories about covid-19. mccarrick died earlier this month. in 2024, francis excommunicated vigano after finding him guilty of schism. papal biographer austen ivereigh said francis dismantled much of the resistance. he lists the amazonian synod as a defining positive moment of his pontificate - not because of the incident with the statues but because the meeting emphasized his key pastoral priority of accompanying the faithful. the native peoples of amazonia were right here in st. peters square, and francis walked across to the synod with them, ivereigh said, recalling the feathered headdresses and indigenous statues that were on display. the pastor among his people, walking together. and i thought, that is him. that sums him up, he said.

  Title: Trump ramps up his attacks on the Fed chair: From the Politics Desk - NBC News
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-21 21:48:36)
  Content: welcome to the online version of from the politics desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the nbc news politics teams latest reporting and analysis from the white house, capitol hill and the campaign trail. in todays edition, we examine how president donald trumps continued broadsides against federal reserve chair jerome powell are affecting the stock and bond markets. plus, a new survey shows broad support for the u.s. system of checks and balances, with republicans more likely to back stronger presidential power. sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. u.s. stocks tumbled and bonds sold off after president donald trump lobbed new insults at federal reserve chair jerome powell, pressuring him to cut interest rates while markets are already contending with shocks from his tariff policy, rob wile reports. the sp closed down 2.4. since its february highs, the index is now off 16, approaching bear market territory of a 20 decline. the tech-heavy nasdaq fell more than 2.5. the dow jones industrial average lost almost 1,000 points, or 2.5. the yield of the 10-year u.s. treasury note surged to 4.41, its highest level in more than a week. all three indexes are down more than 9 since trumps april 2 liberation day tariffs announcement. trumps latest attacks trump claimed that preemptive cuts were being called for by many now that the economy was facing what he described as virtually no inflation. he didnt say who has called for the pre-emptive cuts, which the fed rarely performs. without the cuts, trump wrote on truth social, the economy now risks slowing, unless mr. too late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, now. though trump has long criticized powell, whom he appointed during his first term, his complaints have ramped up in recent days amid a major market reaction to his tariffs shock. what comes next economic adviser kevin hassett said last week that the administration was studying trumps options to remove powell. no president has ever removed a fed chair. the fed has historically been a nonpolitical part of the government, and the prospect of trumps taking action has sparked concern that inflation would surge as he forced the central bank to ease up on its role of controlling price growth in favor of economic growth. hegseth fallout meanwhile, trump stood by defense secretary pete hegseth after nbc news and other outlets reported that he used his personal phone to send information about u.s. military operations in yemen to a 13-person signal group chat, including his wife and his brother. petes doing a great job, trump told reporters at the easter egg roll on the white house south lawn, rebecca shabad reports. just ask the houthis how hes doing, trump said, referring to the iranian-backed group in yemen that was targeted by u.s. airstrikes. hegseth suggested that disgruntled former employees who were recently fired leaked the information about his use of signal group chats to the media. you know, what a big surprise that a bunch of leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out from the same media that peddled the russia hoax, hegseth told reporters at the white house when he was asked about the latest revelations. john ullyot, who had been a top spokesman at the defense department before he left his job last week, wrote in an op-ed for politico that its been a month of total chaos at the pentagon. he added that its hard to see hegseth remaining in his position for much longer. researchers at the annenberg public policy center conducted a study last month as part of the centers institutions of democracy panel survey, interviewing a nationally representative sample of 1,363 americans from march 6 to march 16 on six questions designed to measure their support for the system of checks and balances. the data was remarkably clear americans do not think the president should have the ability to act unconstrained by the courts and congress. with one small exception, a majority of the public rejects the claim that presidents should have expansive powers. while republicans are the most supportive of greater executive power as donald trump sits in the oval office, most of them still reject claims of unilateral authority. instead, democrats, republicans and independents alike believe that the courts and congress should be able to check the presidents actions. the one partial exception is that a majority of republicans think the president should have the authority to decide how executive agencies should implement the law. but even here, it is just a slight majority, and it is arguably a more subtle item than the other questions. only 16 of respondents, for example, said a president should be able to ignore court decisions he believes intrude on his constitutional authority, including 27 of republicans. on the question of whether a president should have the right to enact policies without congress voting on them, 20 of respondents agreed, including a third of republicans. more broadly, 58 overall agreed with the statement that courts prevent elected officials from abusing their power, including 51 of republicans. and 84 overall agreed that courts play a vital role in our system of government, with little variation across partisan lines. read more about the study thats all from the politics desk for now. todays

yeah, well, listen, that thats very good spinach what they serve. but you know, paul, to your point, you know, typically geopolitics sits well in the back seat of the car, if you will, and every once in a while, the driver, which is either interest rates or or corporate profits, who tends to sit shotgun, looks back and says, hey, pipe down. thats just not the case right now. we have this unfortunate series of events where we we obviously have the immediacy of tariffs, but we dont have the clarity on when well actually see tax reform, nor, as i mentioned earlier, when will we actually see more of an active dialogue across global officials. and so the initial salvo with respect to responses from macron, with responses to what we heard from china was, were not necessarily going to come immediately to the negotiation table. so what i think that means is theres probably some more spinach, if you will, being handed out by the by the passenger in the back seat to mix metaphors. but more importantly, what i think this challenges investors like us to think about is just, okay, where does that fundamental case ultimately kick in? what will consumers do? and wed already seen before the tariff announcements some bifurcation between higher income, middle income, and lower income consumers. and if anything, the risk is that gap widens and it widens more quickly. so some of the market reaction we think is that that time gap between moving from the the spinach course to the dessert course, but it also, i think, begs the question of when will we see a deterioration in consumer activity. were not going to learn a lot from the jobs data tomorrow. we will learn from what chair powell has to say with more of his forward views. but ill also just say this, this is actually not very well covered, but we had vice chair jefferson present today in atlanta. and again, very intelligent economist. he mentioned in the course of a 3,000 word presentation, this is the parsing that we do, he used the word tariff once in that entire presentation. so what i think that says is there may be a little bit of a of a hold off of a firm communication from the fed if were to use vice chair jeffersons guidance today. therell be a lot of focus on what we hear from chair powell tomorrow. reuters -institutional shareholder services has recommended pfizer investors reject a proposal on executive compensation at its upcoming annual meeting, citing concerns about certain changes made to long-term awards to its ceo and others. the modifications, including repeated changes to pfizers cash flow targets, and a lack of clarity about certain pipeline goals are concerning and undermine a pay-for-performance philosophy, iss said. annual incentives for executives are tied to achieving three financial goals, and payouts can be 30 percentage points higher or lower based on pipeline and esg-related goals achieved, iss said. cybersecurity stocks have not been immune from the recent market sell-off, opening up some attractive entry points for some of the top companies in the space. lets look at three cybersecurity stocks you might want to buy now and hold for the long term. while known for its next-generation firewalls, palo alto networks nasdaq panw has transformed itself into more of a complete cybersecurity company. buying high-quality dividend stocks is a great way to collect passive dividend income. the best ones increase their dividends each year, and they can help you more than offset the impact of inflation over the long run. federal realty investment trust nyse frt, nnn reit nyse nnn, and essex property trust nyse ess have elite records of growing their dividends. microsoft, alphabet, nvidia and amazon are part of the zacks top analyst blog. here are buffetts words on investing through a crisis. can you retire at 65 with 750,000 in a roth ira and 1,800 in monthly social security?

  Title: Stocks, Dollar Sink on Threats to Fed Independence: Markets Wrap - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-21 14:22:55)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism. The article highlights a power struggle between President Trump and the Federal Reserve, specifically targeting Jerome Powell.  Evidence: "president donald trump stepped up criticism of jerome powell", "trump is studying whether hes able to fire powell", "rebuking the fed risks politicizing us monetary policy".  Interpretation: This aligns with Realist theory, where states (or in this case, branches of government and powerful individuals) are seen as primary actors vying for power and influence. Trump's actions demonstrate an attempt to exert political control over monetary policy, traditionally considered independent, to achieve desired economic outcomes and potentially consolidate power. This could signal a shift towards prioritizing political expediency over institutional norms.; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory. The news article prominently features President Trump's criticisms of the Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell, framing their actions as detrimental to the economy. Evidence: "president donald trump stepped up criticism of jerome powell on social media", "insisting there was virtually no inflation and it was time for preemptive cuts", "trump is studying whether hes able to fire powell". Interpretation: By repeatedly and publicly attacking the Fed, Trump is attempting to set the agenda, influencing public perception and potentially market expectations regarding monetary policy. This relentless criticism, amplified by news media, can shape the narrative around the Fed's performance and pressure them to adopt policies favored by the administration, regardless of the central bank's independent assessment of economic conditions. This illustrates how political actors can leverage media to influence policy discourse and potentially outcomes.; Intriguing_angles: Omission of Counterarguments. The article heavily emphasizes concerns about the Fed's independence being threatened by President Trump's actions and the potential negative market reactions. Textual Basis: The article quotes analysts predicting 'huge injection of volatility' and 'most dramatic rush to the exit from US assets' if Powell is fired. Significance: While presenting a clear narrative of risk, the article notably lacks substantial counterarguments or alternative perspectives. For instance, it does not explore potential benefits of lower interest rates advocated by Trump, nor does it delve into arguments for greater political accountability of the Fed. Probing Questions: Could this selective presentation of viewpoints contribute to a biased understanding of the situation? What are the potential implications of not fully exploring the rationale behind the political pressure on the Federal Reserve?; Intriguing_angles: Implicit Assumption of US Hegemony. The article discusses 'de-dollarisation' and 'move away from US hegemony' as realistic fears arising from the Fed's potential politicization. Textual Basis: 'not only is the independence of the fed clearly under threat, but the prospect of de-dollarisation and a move away from us hegemony is an increasingly realistic one.' Significance: This statement implicitly assumes the existing global order is centered around US dollar dominance and US hegemony, and that actions threatening the Fed's independence could undermine this order. It treats this hegemony as a given, rather than a potentially contested or evolving aspect of international relations. Probing Questions: Is the assumption of unchallenged US hegemony warranted in the current geopolitical landscape? Could the article's framing inadvertently reinforce a US-centric worldview by presenting de-dollarisation as inherently negative without exploring alternative perspectives on a multipolar financial system?

  Title: Dow drops 1,000 points as Trump renews criticism of Fed chief Powell
  Source: www.cbsnews.com (2025-04-21 16:06:32)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: One might analyze the core conflict described through the lens of Principal-Agent Theory, where the President (principal) seeks to influence the Federal Reserve Chair (agent) to achieve specific economic outcomes (lower interest rates for growth). The text highlights this tension directly: "president trump renewed his criticism of federal reserve chair jerome powell... branding him as a major loser" and "mr. trump has put increasing pressure on powell to lower the feds benchmark interest rate." The agent, Powell, appears to resist, citing data and potential inflation risks, suggesting a divergence in goals or information asymmetry, which is central to principal-agent conflicts, particularly when the agent (Fed) has institutional independence.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article also touches upon Institutional Theory by detailing the structural constraints on the President's power over the Fed. The mention of "many legal experts and powell himself say the president lacks authority to fire a fed chief" and the specific reference to "a landmark supreme court ruling from 1935 upholds the independent authority of the fed" underscore the formal institutional barriers designed to protect the Fed's autonomy from political interference. This highlights the friction between political will and established institutional design in the U.S. economic governance structure.; Intriguing_angles: The article notes that President Trump tapped Jerome Powell to lead the central bank in 2017, yet now brands him a "major loser" and seeks lower interest rates. This shift from appointment to strong public criticism is noteworthy. What factors, not explicitly detailed here beyond the desire for lower rates, might explain this significant change in the relationship between the principal (President) and his chosen agent (Fed Chair)? Could this dynamic reveal underlying expectations or agreements at the time of appointment that were not met?; Intriguing_angles: The text quotes Adam Crisafulli stating that Trump's tariffs "havent even shown up in the data," while earlier mentioning Fed Chair Powell warned tariffs "could drive up u.s. inflation and stymie growth." This presents a potential discrepancy in the perceived timing or certainty of the tariffs' economic impact between different observers cited in the article. Does this difference in assessment reflect genuine uncertainty about the economic effects, or could it suggest differing perspectives potentially influenced by political or institutional viewpoints?

  Content: updated on april 21, 2025 1156 am edt cbs news stocks fell sharply on monday as wall street returned from a shortened trading week and president trump renewed his criticism of federal reserve chair jerome powell, branding him as a major loser. the sp 500 fell 152 points, or 2.9, to 5,130 in early trading, while the dow jones industrial average tumbled 1,071 points, or 2.7. the tech-heavy nasdaq composite sank even more sharply, dropping 3.2. stocks were down as investors grapple with ongoing tariff uncertainty and await the release of u.s. tech companies earnings this week. global activity remained light heading into monday as a good portion of markets around the world including europe along with hong kong and australia remain closed for easter monday. the shaky start in the u.s. stock market on monday follows another volatile week in the stock market as investors weigh how the trump administrations tariffs and a potential fed shakeup might impact economic activity. notwithstanding the recent relief for electronic goods, the tariffs on china are leading to a standstill in some trade activity, said tim duy, chief economist at sgh macro advisors, in a research note. stocks also took a hit last wednesday after fed chief powell warned that tariffs could drive up u.s. inflation and stymie growth. president trump and his team have floated the idea of firing powell, who mr. trump tapped to lead the central bank during his first term in 2017. although many legal experts and powell himself say the president lacks authority to fire a fed chief, mr. trumps fierce criticism has fueled investor concerns that the white house could defy norms and seek to replace the central bank chief. referring to powell, mr. trump said on truth social on monday that the economy could slow down unless mr. too late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, now. mr. trump has put increasing pressure on powell to lower the feds benchmark interest rate, which would spur economic growth but also risk boosting inflation. the problem is that powells term still has more than a year to go while trumps tariffs havent even shown up in the data, which means the battle between the fed and white house could get a lot worse in the coming months, adam crisafulli, head of vital knowledge, said in a report. a landmark supreme court ruling from 1935 upholds the independent authority of the fed and would make it difficult to fire powell before his term concludes on may 15, 2026. but that hasnt stopped mr. trump from taking aim at powell, who has stood firm against cutting interest rates until the fed has more economic data on how tariffs will affect the economy. i strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned, chicago fed president austan goolsbee told cbs news senior white house correspondent weijia jiang on face the nation yesterday. because that would undermine the credibility of the fed. investors this week will also focus on corporate earnings from major technology players. those companies, known informally as the magnificent seven, include amazon, google-parent alphabet, apple, facebook-parent meta platforms, microsoft, nvidia and tesla. the big tech groups stocks whipsawed in recent weeks after the trump administration imposed reciprocal tariffs and then backtracked, later announcing office high-tech products would be exempt, if only temporarily. since mr. trumps inauguration on january 20, the magnificent sevens combined market value has dropped by 3.8 trillion, or 22, as of april 20. the associated press contributed to this report. mary cunningham is a news associate at cbs news, based in new york. she has worked on both the broadcast side, with cbs news 247 streaming, and the digital side, writing stories for cbsnews.com. her next assignment is working with the 60 minutes team. 2025 cbs interactive inc. .

  Title: 5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday - CNBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-21 12:04:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism in international relations theory posits states as primary actors pursuing self-interest in an anarchic global system. The article text, particularly phrases like 'trumps trade war with china...continues to escalate', 'beijing promised to retaliate', and 'china will resolutely take reciprocal countermeasures', exemplifies this. These snippets reveal a dynamic of escalating tensions and retaliatory threats between major geopolitical actors driven by perceived national interests and power struggles, aligning with realist interpretations of state behavior.; Theories_and_interpretations: Keynesian economics emphasizes the role of aggregate demand and consumer sentiment in economic cycles. The article states 'americans have grown more sour on trumps handling of the economy...as tariffs and efforts to slash federal government spending hit sentiment' and 'more americans now believe the economy will get worse'. This textual evidence suggests a decline in consumer confidence and economic outlook directly linked to government policies (tariffs, spending cuts), supporting a Keynesian interpretation where government actions significantly influence economic sentiment and potentially trigger downturns.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions 'threats to the federal reserves independence after trump hinted at the termination of fed chair jerome powell' without detailing the nature of these 'threats' or the context of Trump's 'hint'. This omission is noteworthy because central bank independence is crucial for economic stability. What specific actions or statements constitute these 'threats', and what are the potential implications for market confidence if central bank autonomy is perceived to be compromised?; Intriguing_angles: The article twice states 'more americans now believe the economy will get worse than at any time since 2023'. This repetition, and the recent year 2023 as a negative benchmark, is unusual. Is this repetition an error, or is it intentional emphasis? Why is 2023 specifically highlighted? Does this reference point to a particular economic shift or policy change around that time that is being implicitly compared to the current situation, thus framing current pessimism as a significant recent decline?

  Content: here are the most important news items that investors need to start their trading day u.s. stocks were set to fall to start the week, continuing a slump sparked by president donald trumps tariffs on key u.s. trading partners. the three major u.s. indexes have dropped in three of the last four weeks. during the most recent holiday-shortened trading week, the sp 500 slid about 1.5, while the dow jones industrial average and nasdaq composite both fell more than 2. investors will continue to monitor any potential progress in u.s. trade negotiations, along with threats to the federal reserves independence after trump hinted at the termination of fed chair jerome powell. the concurrent slump in stocks, the usd, and treasuries suggests trumps trade war has set in motion an exodus from american financial assets that no amount of negotiating can reverse, wrote adam crisafulli of vital knowledge in a note. follow live market updates. a spate of first-quarter earnings reports this week will also help to determine the path of markets. companies across sectors will offer commentary on whether tariffs and accompanying concerns about a u.s. recession have affected spending by consumers and businesses. tesla will be among the most closely watched reports, as its stock has fallen 40 this year amid the broader market rout and boycotts sparked by ceo elon musks role as a trump advisor. alphabet will also post results after tech stocks led the market lower last week. here are the key reports to watch americans have grown more sour on trumps handling of the economy than at any point in his two terms as president, as tariffs and efforts to slash federal government spending hit sentiment, according to the latest cnbc all-america economic survey. only 43 of respondents approve of how he is handling the economy, while 55 disapprove, the first time in a cnbc poll that trumps approval rating on the issue was net negative. more americans now believe the economy will get worse than at any time since 2023, the poll found. donald trump was reelected specifically to improve the economy, and so far, people are not liking what theyre seeing, said jay campbell, partner with hart associates, the democratic pollster on the survey. trumps trade war with china a key plank of his economic platform continues to escalate and drag in other countries. beijing promised to retaliate against any countries that work with the u.s. to isolate the chinese economy. the warning followed reports that the u.s. aims to use tariff negotiations to pressure trading partners to limit their cooperation with china. china firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of chinas interests. if this happens, china will not accept it and will resolutely take reciprocal countermeasures, the chinese ministry of commerce said, according to a cnbc translation. pope francis, the first roman catholic pontiff from the americas, has died at age 88, the vatican said in a statement monday. taking over in 2013, he presided over the church during a period of global social change on issues like lgbtq rights and abortion, along with the rise of right-wing populism and anti-migrant sentiment in europe and the u.s. francis, who hailed from argentina, had a particular focus on helping poor and marginalized people, and emphasized the importance of combating climate change. cnbcs lisa kailai han, sean conlon, steve liesman, evelyn cheng, marty steinberg, katrina bishop and sam meredith contributed to this report. got a confidential news tip? we want to hear from you. sign up for free newsletters and get more cnbc delivered to your inbox get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services. 2025 cnbc llc. . a division of nbcuniversal data is a real-time snapshot data is delayed at least 15 minutes. global business and financial news, stock quotes, and market data and analysis.

  Title: European Stocks Sink Into Correction as Trade Worries Escalate - Yahoo Finance
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-04 16:06:11)
  Content: bloomberg - european stocks tumbled into a correction on friday as china retaliated against us tariffs, escalating the global trade war. most read from bloomberg housing agency aims to relocate its dc headquarters metro-north is faster than acela on nyc-new haven route after signal updates local governments vie for fired federal workers what would transportation abundance look like? london clears final hurdle for more high-speed trains to europe the stoxx europe 600 index slid 5.1 at the close in london, recording its worst weekly drop since the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic five years ago. indexes in italy, france, switzerland and germany were also in correction territory after news that beijing would impose a 34 tariff on all imports from the us, starting april 10. banks were the biggest laggards, with the stoxx 600 banks index sinking as much as 10. italys ftse mib index weighed down by the weakness in banking stocks led losses among major european benchmarks with a 6.5 slide. every portfolio has to adjust themselves for a recession in a lot of countries, said david kruk, head of trading at la financiere de lechiquier. yesterday, the us bore the brunt of the selloff. now its our turn. still, data showing better-than-expected us job growth in march was somewhat reassuring, according to amelie derambure, senior multi-asset portfolio manager at amundi sa. if the data had been really bad, it would have led to the conclusion that the trump administration and the uncertainty around its policies were already triggering a recession, said derambure. traders had earlier boosted their expectations for the us federal reserve to cut interest rates this year. among individual stock movers, gerresheimer ag fell 15 after bloomberg news reported kkr co. has walked away from a consortium discussing a takeover of the german maker of drug packaging. here is what market participants are saying max kettner, hsbc chief multi-asset strategist we dont think the correction is over yet. in fact our measures of sentiment and positioning are still ambiguous at best. our momentum signals indicate that typical trend-following strategies are still only medium short, and equity exposure on our measure of long-only investors has barely budged so far. equity market breadth in the sp500 is nowhere near capitulation levels yet, and in fact is even still much higher than during the rates-driven dip in january. the average stock has actually been flat ytd until yesterday, so we do think theres quite a bit more pain to come until the fed put can step in vincent juvyns, global market strategist at jpmorgan asset management let me be clear, in no way is this capitulation, its a slap in the face but this is not capitulation. indeed you can see that its the best performing stocks and indexes that are falling the most, like banks, because thats where investors can take their profits. but let me be clear and i say that with conviction for a long term investors, this selloff creates a lot of buying opportunities. the selloff is overdone in my opinion. yes theres going to be macro-economic consequences to the tariffs but my point is that for diversified investors, bonds are perfectly doing their job in cushioning the fall in equities neil birrell, chief investment officer at premier miton investors the bifurcation youre getting within different markets is extraordinary. within equities, its get out of anything thats rate-sensitives, get into safety aneeka gupta, head of macroeconomic research at wisdom tree uk ltd its unprecedented to see this in the second day in a row. chinas response is predominantly setting the stage. the likelihood now is that if with china leading the way, were likely to get more countermeasures being put in place by other economies. right now for market, you could compare it with catching a falling knife. its quite a difficult situation janet mui, head of market analysis at rbc brewin dolphin i think people are fleeing for safety now because the situation appears to be spiraling downward. it is hard to see a scenario where most of the tariffs will be rolled back in the near term. the sentiment shock is going to inflict a lot of harm for both the u.s. and elsewhere raphael thuin, head of capital markets strategies at tikehau capital today weve entered an escalation phase with countries starting to retaliate and its not possible to know how this will end. we must get used to the idea that this a regime change growth expectations will be cut down and inflation forecast revised upwards. even if one ignores for a minute the immediate market action, long term, the horizon has darkened. whats also worrying is that central banks wont be in a position to weigh in that much given that this new cycle is an inflationary one susana cruz, panmure liberum strategist it looks like investors are playing it safe, with the announcement of chinese retaliations adding to the already growing recession risks. they seem to be bracing for more bad news, as sectors with strong momentum before the tariffs, like european banks and industrials, face a deeper selloff. quality stocks and low volatility are providing some shelter amid the storm. for more on equity markets timing to go defensive has rarely been better taking stock ma watch europe kkr, gerresheimer, carrefour, shell,

  Title: Stock market rallies after closed-door remarks by Treasury Secretary Bessent - Fortune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 20:15:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The recurring mentions of 'Trump tariffs' and 'Trump policy changes' alongside discussions of corporate hits (RTX), market reactions ('volatility spike', 'markets open sharply higher'), and geopolitical shifts ('softens on china', 'china de-escalation') align with aspects of Political Economy theory. This perspective suggests that political decisions and the actions of key political figures (like Trump) are not merely isolated events but have direct, measurable consequences on economic actors (companies like RTX, markets) and international economic relations (China trade). The text provides evidence of this linkage by explicitly connecting policy actions (tariffs, changes) to economic outcomes (hits, market shifts).; Theories_and_interpretations: The juxtaposition of headlines about market reactions to political statements ('investors are finally taking trump seriously', 'markets open sharply higher after trump softens') and the mention of 'agenda-setting' in the context of financial news (implied by the focus on specific topics like tariffs, Fed Chair, China) could be viewed through the lens of Agenda-Setting Theory. While typically applied to media influence on public perception, here it highlights how the *focus* of political figures (Trump's statements on China, Powell) can directly influence the *agenda* of financial markets and news coverage, demonstrating the power of political rhetoric to shape economic attention and action, as evidenced by the immediate market response described.; Intriguing_angles: The text mentions 'doges staffing cuts' as a cause for the IRS's 'nightmare' tax season and potential refund delays. The term 'doges' is unusual in this context and lacks clear identification as a standard entity type (Organization, Government Agency). Its significance lies in being presented as a direct causal factor for a major government agency's operational failure, yet its nature remains undefined within the article. What entity or concept does 'doges' represent in this context, and why is it presented as a singular, impactful cause without further clarification?

Historical Article 10 (ID: 129482):
  Title: Abu Dhabi Continues Building Big In Culture Push
  Source: finance.yahoo.com (2025-04-21 15:11:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Political Economy theory, the article demonstrates how direct political intervention, specifically President Trump's threats against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and pressure to cut rates, is presented as a primary driver of market instability. The text states the US dollar and treasuries are 'under pressure' and 'selling off' due to 'fallout from president trumps threats' and that risks to 'fed independence' put 'downward pressure on the confidence that foreign investors have'. This aligns with political economy perspectives where political actors' actions, even those targeting independent institutions, have immediate and tangible economic consequences, disrupting market confidence and asset values.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article heavily utilizes Agenda-Setting Theory by focusing on specific, curated topics and expert opinions presented as central to market movements. Phrases like 'stories driving the market action', 'stocks in focus this week', and repeated references to 'Jim Cramer's game plan' or lists like '12 AI stocks on wall streets radar' highlight how financial media and analysts select and emphasize certain narratives (political pressure on the Fed, specific tech stock performance, curated investment lists) to shape the perceived market agenda for investors. This suggests the article's structure is designed to direct reader attention to these specific points, potentially influencing their investment focus.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions 'uncertainty surrounding federal policy' contributing to businesses being 'priced for a significant slowdown... if not a recession'. However, it also notes that hopes for the 'new administrations pro-business approach swiftly gave way to tariff fears'. Textual Basis: These points appear in the paragraphs referencing investment letters from Heartland Advisors and Ariel Investments. Significance: The text presents both 'uncertainty' from federal policy and a 'pro-business approach' as factors, but then immediately links the 'pro-business approach' to 'tariff fears' that caused investors to 'fled to shelter'. This juxtaposition is intriguing because it suggests that the *specific nature* of the 'pro-business' policies (tariffs) was the source of the uncertainty and negative market reaction, potentially complicating or even contradicting a simple 'pro-business' label. Probing Question: How does the article reconcile the idea of a 'pro-business approach' with the simultaneous rise of 'tariff fears' and 'uncertainty surrounding federal policy' leading to recession pricing? Does the text imply certain 'pro-business' policies are inherently destabilizing for markets?

street opened on thursday morning after donald trump unveiled his latest wave of tariffs on what the president called liberation day. trumps announcement sent shockwaves through markets around the globe, and shortly after the bell rang at the new york stock exchange, the dow jones industrial average fell 1,150 points or 2.7. the sp 500 dropped more than 3, and the tech-focused nasdaq more than 4.2. the president announced that blanket 10 percent tariffs will be imposed on all nations in a speech at a make america wealthy again event in the white house rose garden shortly after regular trading hours closed in the u.s. about 60 countries deemed the worst offenders including china where a majority of apples devices are manufactured face higher reciprocal levies nearing, in some cases, 50 percent leaving world leaders reeling. the baseline tariffs go into effect on saturday and reciprocal tariffs on wednesday. meanwhile, four republican senators joined every democratic senator in a resolution to oppose trumps tariffs against canada. the senate passed the resolution crafted by kentucky senator rand paul 51-48 on wednesday after trumps announcement. a senate hearing devolved into chaos after sen. ted cruz repeatedly spoke over sen. amy klobuchar as the pair exchanged barbs over nationwide injunctions inhibiting president donald trumps agenda. during wednesdays hearing, the texas lawmaker excoriated federal judges and declared that nationwide injunctions are an abuse of power. cruzs comments come as republicans are attempting to pass a bill to limit judicial rulings against the trump administration. james liddell reports. andrew feinberg and katie hawkinson report from washington, d.c. far-right activist laura loomer met with president donald trump and pressed him to fire several members of the national security council and reports indicate he has taken her advice. trump fired several members of the national security council, including senior directors, after the meeting, axios reports. one u.s. official told the outlet the firings are shaping up to be a bloodbath. the new yorktimes added that at least three senior nsc officials have been fired. this comes after times first reported loomer met with trump, vice president jd vance, national security adviser mike waltz and others in the oval office on wednesday, armed with extensive research she believed worked against several staffers. donald trumps press secretary has claimed that he is partly responsible for a spiritual revival in america and is helping people move closer to god. karoline

led european leaders in condemning donald trumps sweeping tariffs. pedro sanchez, whose country sells large amounts of car parts, steel and chemicals to the us, described the move to bring in reciprocal tariffs on imported goods from the eu as unintelligent and a return to 19th-century protectionism. steffie banatvala reports. its midday in new york, two and half hours since markets opened on wall street, and initial losses on the major indices appear to have leveled out for now and even recovered slightly from their trading low points. they all remain significantly down from the opening. the dow jones industrial average is now down 1,296 points 3.11 the sp 500 is down 215 points 3.79 and the tech-focused nasdaq has lost 863 points 4.90. canada will impose a 25 tariff on all vehicles imported from the united states that are not compliant with the u.s.-mexico-canada trade deal, prime minister mark carney told a press conference on thursday. carney also said the new tariffs would not apply to auto parts and would not affect vehicle content from mexico. two senior lawmakers on the senate finance committee introduced legislation on thursday aimed at limiting u.s. president donald trumps ability to impose tariffs and requiring congressional approval for new levies within 60 days. republican senator chuck grassley and democrat maria cantwell presented a bill that mandates the president to notify congress about new tariffs, providing an explanation of the rationale along with an analysis of the potential impact on u.s. businesses and consumers. congress must pass a joint resolution of approval for the new tariff within 60 days otherwise, all new tariffs on imports would expire. this bill reasserts congress role over trade policy to ensure rules-based trade policies are transparent, consistent, and benefit the american public, cantwell said. as representatives of the american people, congress has a duty to stop actions that will cause them harm. the bill is based on the war powers resolution of 1973 and aims to reestablish limits on the presidents authority to impose unilateral tariffs without congressional approval. for too long, congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch, grassley said. grassleys home state of iowa relies significantly on farm crop exports, whereas cantwells washington state hosts many export-driven companies like boeing. the senate passed legislation on wednesday that would terminate new tariffs on canada. with reporting from reuters the newsmax team and former trump lawyer and ally rudy giuliani got to ring the opening bell at the new york stock exchange this morning. bit of a shame for them that it was on a day when the presidents

  Title: Conservative Group Tries to Stop in Court...
  Source: www.vox.com (2025-04-04 20:58:36)
  Content: at least some gop legal elites are lining up against trumps trade policy. that could be enough to sway the justices. on thursday, one day after president donald trump announced sweeping new tariffs, what appears to be the first lawsuit challenging those tariffs was filed in a federal court in florida. that alone isnt particularly surprising. the tariffs are expected to drive up the costs of goods in the united states, and have already sent the stock market into a nose dive. that means that a lot of aggrieved potential plaintiffs have standing to challenge the tariffs in court. what is surprising is that the plaintiff in this particular case, known as emily ley paper v. trump, is represented by the new civil liberties alliance ncla, a right-wing legal shop that previously backed trumps efforts to expand executive power. get the latest developments on the us supreme court from senior correspondent ian millhiser. ncla is part of what appears to be a growing effort among prominent right-leaning intellectuals and commentators to challenge trumps tariffs. at the volokh conspiracy, an influential right-libertarian legal blog, george mason law professor ilya somin is actively recruiting plaintiffs to file a similar lawsuit challenging the tariffs somin has long been a principled libertarian critic of trump. ben shapiro, the one-time breitbart writer who is also a lawyer, criticized trumps tariffs as a massive tax increase on american consumers, and has gently advocated for trump to change course. richard hanania, a writer best known for his baroque criticisms of wokeness, responded to a pro-trump member of congress praise of the tariffs with were ruled by morons. all of this matters because conservative-minded judges, including the six republicans who dominate the supreme court, are often highly responsive to public statements from conservative legal and media elites. during president barack obamas first term, for example, liberal lawyers and legal scholars were often flabbergasted by how quickly conservative judges rallied behind a weak legal case against the affordable care act eventually persuading four republican justices to vote to repeal the law altogether. their mistake one i made as well was assuming that judges would be persuaded by the kind of careful, precedent-focused legal reasoning that earns you top grades in law school, rather than by what they were hearing from legal and political elites that they viewed as ideological allies. as yale law professor jack balkin wrote about that error, a legal argument can move from off the wall to on the wall because people and institutions are willing to put their reputations on the line and state that an argument formerly thought beyond the pale is not crazy at all. in the end, many judges cared more about what they heard on fox news or at an event hosted by the federalist society, than they did about what the supreme court said in gonzales v. raich 2005. at least on the surface, anyone who wants to challenge trumps tariffs faces a far more favorable legal landscape than obamacare opponents faced in 2010. during the obama and biden administrations, republican justices fabricated novel new legal doctrines, such as the so-called major questions doctrine, in order to strike down democratic policies they deemed too ambitious. they also threatened to revive old, once-discredited ideas like the nondelegation doctrine, which was used to frustrate president franklin d. roosevelts new deal. both of these doctrines are grounded in the idea that the judiciary has broad power to strike down policies established by the executive branch of the federal government, even if the executive can point to an act of congress that explicitly gives them the power to do what they want to do. the primary reason to be skeptical that the supreme court will actually apply one of these doctrines to strike down trumps tariffs is that the republican justices rollout of their new approach to executive power has been so partisan that it is hard not to suspect that they are acting in bad faith. the same six republican justices who said that democratic president joe bidens student loan forgiveness program was an egregious power grab, despite the fact that that program was authorized by a federal statute empowering the executive to waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs, also said that republican president donald trump is allowed to use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes. similarly, the best legal argument against trumps tariffs is rooted in the courts major questions doctrine, which holds that judges should cast a skeptical eye on executive branch actions of vast economic and political significance according to the budget lab at yale, the tariffs are expected to reduce the average american households real annual income by nearly 3,800. that seems like a matter of vast economic and political significance. but the short history of this major questions doctrine would give any serious legal scholar great pause. the idea that programs of vast economic and political significance are suspect was first articulated in utility air regulatory group v. epa 2014, in order to criticize a hypothetical environmental protection agency regulation that was never enacted, that no one ever proposed, and that likely would have shut down all construction of hotels in the united states if it had ever actually existed. a year later, the court used the major questions doctrine again to repudiate an imaginary health regulation that would have collapsed the individual health insurance markets in most states. having used these strawmen to invent a completely new legal doctrine that appears nowhere in the constitution or in any statute, the court let this major questions doctrine lay dormant for trumps entire first term only to revive it with a vengeance once a democrat became president. to date, the doctrine has only been used to strike down actual, rather than theoretical, policies during the biden administration. one of the most important questions looming over trumps second term is whether a republican supreme court will apply the same rules it invented to thwart democratic administrations to trump and his subordinates. we do not know yet how the justices will answer this question. but, as balkin writes, the answer is likely to be shaped by how elite conservatives in the legal profession, the media, and in elected office urge the justices to behave. one of the most important questions is whether elected republicans join groups like ncla or commentators like shapiro in criticizing the tariffs. what really accelerates the movement of constitutional arguments from off the wall to on the wall is neither intellectuals nor social movements, balkin wrote about the obamacare fight. instead, the most important factor is often what republicans in political office want the courts to do. when establishment politicians who, after all, have to stand for election and dont want to be thought out-of-touch to their constituents get behind a constitutional argument, they often help move it forward quickly, balkin wrote. for now, it remains to be seen whether members of congress, governors, and other top elected republicans will speak out against the tariffs once their constituents start to experience the pain of higher prices. but if you are hoping to see these tariffs go away, you should take the fact that the first spear targeting the tariffs was thrown by a prominent right-wing legal shop as a very positive sign. understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news

  Title: Oklahoma Educators Target 'Atheists' in New Lawsuit Over Religious Freedom
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-02 21:53:31)

his focus includes u.s. and international politics and policies, immigration, crime and social issues. other reporting has covered education, economics, and wars in ukraine and gaza. nick joined newsweek in 2021 from the oakland press, and his reporting has been featured in the detroit news and other publications. his reporting on the opioid epidemic garnered a statewide michigan press association award. the michigan state university graduate can be reached at n.mordowanecnewsweek.com. based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. oklahoma superintendent ryan walters and the states department of education have sued the freedom from religion foundation ffrf, claiming that the organization is conducting a blatant attack on the religious freedoms and christians of oklahoma students. we wont stand idly by while atheists try to erase faith, walters said in a statement. when reached for comment, a spokesperson for walters referred newsweek to comments he made earlier this week in a press release and social media posts. walters has drawn national attention and some scrutiny for his open endorsements of pro-religious policies across oklahomas public schools, in addition to bringing his support for president donald trump into statewide classrooms. in november, less than two weeks after trumps election victory, walters announced that oklahoma would be the first state in the nation to purchase more than 500 bibles to be put into classrooms. those bibles mimicked the god bless the usa bibles, endorsed by trump earlier in 2024, which include the u.s. constitution, bill of rights, declaration of independence and pledge of allegiance. around the same time period, walters touted the formation of oklahomas new department of religious freedom and patriotism within the state department of education osde. not only were public school superintendents sent videos requiring them to show students his video announcementwhich included walters praying for trumpbut also told school districts to also send the video to students parents. oklahoma attorney general gentner drummond later said that walters couldnt force schools to show the video to students. the lawsuit filed by walters and osed against ffrf on march 31 is described by officials as a legal response to ffrfs issuance of a cease-and-desist letter to an oklahoma school district achilles public schools, or aps for allowing a student to pray over the intercom. oklahoma will never be bullied by radical, out-of-state atheists who use intimidation and harassment against kids, walters said in a statement. the freedom from religion foundation has no stake in our schools, no authority over our communities, and absolutely no right to trample on the first amendment. their threats are nothing more than a desperate attempt to erase faith from public life, and we will fight them at every turn. the 24-page lawsuit, shared with newsweek, states that oklahoma statute clearly and unambiguously states that prayer is for any students who wish to do so and are not forced upon studentsadding that under the states parents bill of rights, multiple opt-out provisions are contained within regarding curriculum, instruction and participation. on or about december 17, 2024, aps superintendent rick beene reportedly received a letter from ffrf regarding unconstitutional school-sponsored prayer and bible readings. ffrf allegedly claimed that a concerned parent reported that the district implemented a policy allowing teachers to read bible verses at the beginning of their classes and that the district has a custom and practice of beginning each school day with a mandatory student-led prayer over the schools intercom systems. oklahoma is fighting back. our kids, our parents, and our teachers will not be harassed for expressing their belief in god. well see you in court ffrf. pic.twitter.comt3g7pc7z82 the district must cease permitting instructors to teach students bible verses, and it must end its schools practice of beginning each day with school-sponsored student-led prayers, the ffrf also purportedly wrote. despite having no standing whatsoever to do so, ffrf continuously threatens oklahoma public schools with demand letters under the guise speaking on behalf of anonymous concerned parents who have contacted them, the lawsuit reads. ffrf legal director patrick elliott told newsweek the lawsuit is frivolous. its not an attempt to improve education in oklahoma, elliott said. it seems to be political and to try to stifle the speech of the foundation in terms of our prior letters to school districts. we stand behind those. i think those raise serious constitutional problems with how some schools were operating. ffrf stands behind the idea that public schools cannot broadcast prayer at the start of a school day, he added, and they cant have teachers or students reading mandatory bible readings every day. elliott described them as violations of the first amendment. asked about walters past comments and actions regarding religion in schools, such as placing bibles inside classrooms, elliott said the actions are all related. its related in the sense that he wants to take over local control of schools, which are governed by local school boards, he said. he doesnt have authority to tell them what to do in terms of their particular curricular materials or whether or not they engage in prayer or bible readings. hes really just trying to overreach and tells local schools what to do. so in terms of the state law and regulations, we just dont think he has any role like this at all to tell schools what to do on this. about 698,923 students were enrolled in an oklahoma school as of october of the 2023-2024 school year, according to the oklahoma state report card. the pew research center said that oklahoma is tied for the 8th most religious state overall with 66 of adults identifying as highly religious and 71 saying they believe in god with absolute certainty. ffrf co-president annie laurie gaylor ryan walters is a loose cannon bent on destroying secular public education in oklahoma. we are proud of ffrfs record of support for true religious freedom and the rights of conscience of a captive audience of schoolchildren to be free from government-sponsored indoctrination in our public schools. elliott said that ffrfs next move will be to dismiss the lawsuit. walters and osed said that the state remains resolute in its position and will vigorously oppose any efforts to undermine religious expression in its schools. newsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair we value your input and

  Title: John Roberts Sides With Supreme Court Liberals Against President...
  Source: www.newsweek.com (2025-04-05 02:07:37)
  Content: based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. the u.s. supreme court on friday sided with the trump administration, allowing it to proceed with cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in teacher-training funds while a legal challenge continues. the decision, a 5-4 ruling, marks a significant development in the administrations broader effort to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion dei initiatives. chief justice john roberts broke from the courts conservative majority, joining the three liberal justices in dissent. newsweek reached out to the department of education for comment via email friday afternoon. why it matters fridays decision comes amid a litany of challenges to the trump administrations sweeping changes to the federal government since the january 20 inauguration, with the president expressing displeasure at district court judges who have attempted to, and in some cases succeeded in, blocking various policies from immigration to education. president donald trump left greets supreme court chief justice john roberts as he arrives to deliver an address to a joint session of congress at the u.s. capitol on march 4, 2025, in washington. president donald trump left greets supreme court chief justice john roberts as he arrives to deliver an address to a joint session of congress at the u.s. capitol on march 4, 2025, in washington. win mcnameegetty images what to know at issue are two federal grant programsthe teacher quality partnership and supporting effective educator developmentwhich provide over 600 million annually to support teacher preparation, particularly in critical fields like math, science and special education. eight democratic-led states challenging the cuts argue that the programs have boosted teacher retention and helped address the national teacher shortage. the administration halted the funding abruptly in february, without public notice. u.s. district judge myong joun, appointed by president joe biden, temporarily blocked the move, ruling that it likely violated federal law by failing to offer a clear justification. the 1st u.s. circuit court of appeals in boston upheld the block, rejecting the trump administrations request to lift the pause. the supreme courts decision to grant the emergency appeal now allows the administration to proceed with the cuts while the case plays out. the majority reasoned that the states could continue funding the programs with their own resources in the interim and noted that the federal government likely wouldnt be able to recover the funds if it eventually prevails. roberts siding with his liberal colleagues comes after he rebuked the president a few weeks ago when trump sought the removal of another judge who placed a temporary restraining order on his use of the alien enemies act. the case is one of several in which the justice department argues that lower courts are improperly obstructing trumps policy agenda. the administration has been aggressive in dismantling what it characterizes as woke programs, including canceling dozens of education department contracts it deemed unnecessary. trump has also signed an executive order to dismantle the department altogether. jouns restraining order was sought by california and seven other statesmassachusetts, new jersey, colorado, illinois, maryland, new york and wisconsinwhich allege that the cuts are politically motivated and part of a broader effort to eliminate dei-related initiatives in education. what people are saying justice elena kagan, in her dissenting motion it is a mistake for the court to grant this emergency application. nowhere in its papers does the government defend the legality of canceling the education grants at issue here. justices ketanji brown jackson and sonia sotomayor, in their dissenting motion this courts eagerness to insert itself into this early stage of ongoing litigation over the lawfulness of the departments actionseven when doing so facilitates the infliction of significant harms on the plaintiff states, and even though the government has not bothered to press any argument that the departments harmcausing conduct is lawfulis equal parts unprincipled and unfortunate. the justice department, in court filings beyond the systemic, irreparable constitutional harm to the executive branch from judicial arrogation of executive functions as to how and when agencies will disburse or cancel grants, even the court of appeals acknowledged that the government may incur some irreparable harm if it cannot recoup this money. what happens next the legal battle continues, but with the supreme courts ruling, the administration can move forward with the funding cuts while the underlying lawsuit proceeds through the courts. reporting by the associated press contributed to this story.

  Title: Is Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. (FOLD) Among the Best Guru Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts?
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-23 17:16:44)
  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. we recently published a list of 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. in this article, we are going to take a look at where amicus therapeutics, inc. nasdaqfold stands against other guru stocks to invest in. wall street seems to be breathing a little easier after the initial panic over president trumps tariffs earlier this month, but the rollercoaster is not over just yet. all three major indexes closed last week in the red, with the dow and nasdaq both dipping over 2, and the broader market down more than 1. even though markets remain closed on april 18 for good friday, the general consensus is that the worst of the trade war headlines might be dying down. marko papic, chief strategist of geomacro strategy at bca research, remains cautiously optimistic, noting that while the idea of president trump striking 90 trade deals in 90 days sounds ambitious, they will likely be small, symbolic wins that still help calm markets. that said, volatility is expected to continue, and papic predicts the broader market could dip again before bouncing back, potentially giving investors a buying opportunity. investors are deep in earnings season right now, and some of wall streets biggest banks have reported solid first-quarter results. a big part of their success came from their trading desks, which cashed in on the recent market volatility, especially in equities. however, despite strong numbers on paper, bank ceos remain cautious and are hesitant to make big moves right now because of the market uncertainty. the us dollar also just had its worst weekly performance since 2022. meanwhile, investors are playing it safe and rapidly buying bonds, which pushed the 10-year treasury yield down to around 4.28. while some investors are seeing the current market dip as a buying opportunity, daniel von ahlen from globaldata ts lombard says otherwise. he believes the risks of a recession are being seriously underestimated. even though trumps recent tariff halt gave markets a bit of a boost, ahlen thinks that bounce will not last. in his view, this is not the time to scoop up stocks on the cheap, he is actually advising people to sell into rallies and avoid the usual buy-the-dip strategy. ahlen suggests getting a bit more cautious and selective. instead of jumping into the whole market, he recommends focusing on defensive sectors, like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare, that tend to hold up better in downturns. the market uncertainty is reflected in etfs as well, which are often considered wiser investment options due to active management strategies and lower risk compared to individual investing. for example, the guru etf is down 8.30 year-to-date as of april 18. however, over the last 12 months, the fund has posted share price returns of 13.38. similarly, five-year share returns stand at an impressive 51.57. guru gives retail investors a way to tap into the top stock picks of major hedge funds at a relatively low 0.75 expense ratio. it offers a more affordable and flexible way to try and beat the broader market using expert insights. so, lets take a look at the best guru stocks to buy. doctors in a lab coat attending to a patient receiving enzyme replacement therapies. for this article, we looked up the guru etf, which had 82 holdings as of april 18. next, we manually searched for the average upside potential of each stock and selected 11 stocks with the highest values. the list below is ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of april 18. we have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment as of q4 2024. why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
