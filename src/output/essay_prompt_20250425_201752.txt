  Title: 'He embraced all people': Californians mourn a pope who shared their values, brought excitement to church
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-21 18:51:44)
  Content: catholics across california mourned the death of pope francis on monday, paying tribute to his modernization of the roman catholic church and steadfast commitment to the poor and marginalized. francis, the first pontiff from latin america, never visited california. but he forged a close bond with the more than 5 million catholics who live in los angeles, largely because he nudged the church to a more tolerant position on social issues by urging compassion for immigrants, arguing for tolerance of gay people and advocating for action on climate change. i have to say what im feeling today is very personal, the archbishop of los angeles, josé h. gomez, told a crowd of nearly 2,000 mourners and tourists who poured into a noon mass at the cathedral of our lady of the angels in downtown los angeles. im going to miss him big time. francis, the catholic churchs 266th leader, made history when he became the first latin american pontiff in 2013. born in 1936 in argentina to italian immigrants, he was also the first pope to take his papal name from st. francis of assisi, a saint who dedicated his life to serving the poor. gomez said francis was like a wise father, a big brother. the fact that he was from a latin american country and the first pope to speak spanish meant a lot to people in that part of the world, including immigrants in l.a. it was very special to us, gomez, who was born in monterrey, mexico, said after the afternoon mass. for us, it was a clear manifestation of the presence of the church in our countries and sense of joy knowing that we are an important part of the life of the church. outside the cathedral, which serves the largest population of catholics in the united states, mourners lay bouquets of red and white roses, white lilies and pink carnations monday morning at the feet of a mosaic of the virgin of guadalupe. inside, cynthia cook and her mother, julieta camacha, offered their silent prayers as cathedral bells rang overhead. i was just in shock, because i thought he was recovering, cook said of francis. the day before, she had watched news reports of francis giving the traditional easter blessing sunday from the balcony of st. peters basilica in the vatican. cook said francis embodied a love for everyone. as the head of the catholic church, he put it out that immigrants are gods children, she said. a tear wells up in the eye of a parishioner maria rodriguez at cathedral of our lady of the angels in downtown los angeles during a noon mass on april 21, 2025. jason armond los angeles times . in riverside, isabel torres prayed to god and asked for his guidance after the end of a packed morning mass at queen of angels catholic church. torres, who works at the church as a cleaner, said she was very sad when she found out about francis death. but at the same time, she said in spanish, i thanked god for the time he gave us with him. a mexican immigrant, torres saw francis as a reflection of god and an example for the way the catholic community should live, primarily through humility. she particularly appreciated how francis urged compassion for migrants. with the help of god almighty, i hope the death of the pope touches the hearts of these presidents, torres said. and that they see us all the same and that they understand we have the right to this world, no matter the race or color. immigrants across southern california valued francis constant emphasis on the right to migrate, said the rev. thomas p. rausch, emeritus professor of catholic theology at loyola marymount university in los angeles. its a fundamental human right, but its not one always appreciated by government, rausch said. after holding mass at queen of angels chapel, the rev. benediktus obon said he hoped the new pontiff would continue the legacy left behind by francis. he was a man of peace, obon said. he loved humanity. he embraced all people, and didnt care who you were. we are all creatures of god. obon acknowledged the role francis played in changing the negative narrative surrounding the catholic church before he took over as pope. his presence in the church brought lots of good things, obon said. he also brought lots of people back to church. for the community, this is a big loss. for obon, it was important that the next pope carries out the criticism of the current u.s. administrations treatment of immigrants that francis carried out until the last day of his life when he met with vice president j.d. vance. see them as human beings first, see them as part of yourself in other people, he said. a parishioner at cathedral of our lady of the angels in downtown los angeles kneels before a portrait of pope francis during a noon mass. jason armond los angeles times just months after assuming the papacy in 2013, francis took his first official trip outside rome to visit the italian island of lampedusa to focus on the plight of migrants and asylum seekers. we have this enormous number of people on the move today, fleeing poverty, injustice, war, violence, and hes shown a real concern for that, rausch said. francis also used his platform to urge tolerance for gay catholics. if a person is gay, and seeks god and has goodwill, who am i to judge? he told a reporter in 2013. in 2022, francis met with former u.s. house speaker nancy pelosi , and she received communion during a papal mass in st. peters basilica, after san francisco archbishop salvatore cordileone barred her from receiving the sacrament in his archdiocese because of her stance on abortion rights. i join the family of god here in the archdiocese of los angeles, and catholics all over the world, in grieving the loss of our holy father, los angeles archbishop josé h. gomez, above, said in a statement. jason armond los angeles times pelosi was one of many political figures across california who paid tribute to francis. in a statement monday, she descirbed him as a beacon of charity, hope and love for all people of faith, he saw god in all his creatures, said gov. gavin newsom, a catholic who met francis last year when he attended a climate summit at the vatican. at the time, newsom was struck by francis praise of californias position on the death penalty. pope francis led with his love of peace and creation and sought to protect and lift up the vulnerable, newsom said in a statement . his papacy was defined by moral courage, a deep respect for all creation, and a profound belief in the power of love to heal and unite. los angeles county supervisor janice hahn, who is not catholic, celebrated francis as a spiritual leader who forged connections with angelenos of all denominations. he reached millions of hearts far beyond the catholic church, she said in a statement, with his words on the greatest challenges facing our world, from war to poverty to climate change to the marginalization of lgbtq people.

  Title: SURVEY: Half Americans Have Given Up On Saving Money...
  Source: studyfinds.org (2025-04-22 15:37:37)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article highlights the prevalence of financial insecurity among Americans, influencing public perception and potentially shaping policy priorities. The repeated emphasis on savings shortfalls and reliance on savings for emergencies, "67 of americans feel theyre lagging behind their savings targets. even worse, 47 have completely given up hope," frames the issue as a widespread problem. This can lead to increased public concern and demand for solutions.; Intriguing_angles: The article highlights Gen Z's relatively high satisfaction with their banks (71%) but also their willingness to switch (45%). This juxtaposition is intriguing because it suggests a potential disconnect between perceived satisfaction and actual loyalty. What specific factors, beyond those mentioned, might be driving Gen Z's willingness to switch banks despite their reported satisfaction? Could this indicate a deeper dissatisfaction with certain aspects of banking services that aren't fully captured by the satisfaction metric?

  Title: Christians make up vast majority of US immigrants facing deportation under Trump
  Source: www.the-independent.com (2025-04-02 09:18:34)
  Content: about 10 million christians living in the us are deemed vulnerable to removal from reproductive rights to climate change to big tech, the independent is on the ground when the story is developing. whether its investigating the financials of elon musks pro-trump pac or producing our latest documentary, the a word, which shines a light on the american women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. at such a critical moment in us history, we need reporters on the ground. your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. the independent is trusted by americans across the entire political spectrum. and unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. we believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. a new report reveals that up to 80 per cent of immigrants facing deportation from the us under the trump administrations policies are christian. this equates to approximately 10 million christians vulnerable to removal, with an additional seven million us christian citizens living in households under threat of deportation. the report, backed by prominent catholic and evangelical organizations, utilizes a combination of data sources. these include religious affiliation percentages within migrant and national populations, alongside an advocacy groups analysis of us census data concerning migrants. while the report highlights the plight of christian immigrants, its sponsors emphasize a broader concern for all individuals facing deportation. though were deeply concerned about fellow christians, were not exclusively concerned with immigrants who happen to share our faith,explained matthew soerens, vice president of advocacy and policy at world relief, an evangelical humanitarian organization and co-sponsor of the report. soerens, in a video statement, underscored the christian belief in the inherent dignity of all people, regardless of religion or nationality. he noted, however, that many us christians may be unaware of the significant number of potential deportees who share their faith. other groups that helped produce the report include the national association of evangelicals, the u.s. conference of catholic bishops committee on migration and the center for the study of global christianity at gordon-conwell theological seminary in massachusetts. while the report doesnt advocate any political positions, it mainly seeks to raise awareness of the issue among christians, and some of its sponsoring groups have individually advocated for reforms that would give some categories of immigrants a path to legal status. immigrants at risk of deportation range from those who crossed the border illegally to those who may have some sort of legal status that could be revoked. for example, the trump administration has taken steps to end temporary protected status, held by many from venezuela and haiti, as well as humanitarian parole that had been granted for others from those troubled countries as well as cuba and nicaragua. president donald trump enjoyed wide support from certain christian blocs in all three of his campaigns. in 2024, he was supported by about eight in 10 white evangelical christian voters, about six in 10 white catholics and just over half of latino evangelicals, according to ap votecast, a sweeping survey of more than 120,000 voters. while the report doesnt directly refer to that support, it says it seeks to raise awareness of the potential impact of trumps immigration crackdown. even the fear of deportation could cause people to avoid going to public places such as worship services. in an era when a growing number of people in the u.s. dont have a religious affiliation, many immigrants who are christian have helped reenergize churches and spur their growth, said walter kim, president of the national association of evangelicals. theyre coming from parts of the world where the church is actually thriving, kim said. not only are they bringing that thriving faith and contributing to america, theyre also contributing to the vibrancy of the church in america. mass deportation would amount to a government-fostered church decline strategy, kim said. kim said his organization has long advocated for reforms that would distinguish between those convicted of violent crimes and the much larger share of immigrants who are contributing to our communities and to our churches, and who are serious and eager to stay in the country. many studies have found immigrants are less drawn to violent crime than native-born citizens. the recent report said catholics in particular represent more than half of all those vulnerable to deportation in the united states, noted bishop mark seitz, chair of the committee on migration of the bishops conference. the deportations would likely separate family members, seitz said. we know the impact of tearing apart the family unity and also the tremendous threats that are faced by people who are summarily deported to their home countries, which they fled in the first place because of the tremendous threats they were living under there, said seitz, who heads the diocese of el paso, texas. they face danger from government oppression and organized crime in their home countries, seitz said. people are going to die if this deportation effort continues at the level it is, he said. the reports methodology included calculating the percentages of catholics, evangelicals and other christian groups in the countries from which immigrants originated, based on self-reported affiliations. the report then applied those percentages to immigrant populations within various categories of immigrants. while such methods include numerous assumptions, many regions of origin for major immigrants and refugee groups, including latin america, sub-saharan africa and ukraine, have large christian populations. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their replies

  Title: 5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday - CNBC
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-21 12:04:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism in international relations theory posits states as primary actors pursuing self-interest in an anarchic global system. The article text, particularly phrases like 'trumps trade war with china...continues to escalate', 'beijing promised to retaliate', and 'china will resolutely take reciprocal countermeasures', exemplifies this. These snippets reveal a dynamic of escalating tensions and retaliatory threats between major geopolitical actors driven by perceived national interests and power struggles, aligning with realist interpretations of state behavior.; Theories_and_interpretations: Keynesian economics emphasizes the role of aggregate demand and consumer sentiment in economic cycles. The article states 'americans have grown more sour on trumps handling of the economy...as tariffs and efforts to slash federal government spending hit sentiment' and 'more americans now believe the economy will get worse'. This textual evidence suggests a decline in consumer confidence and economic outlook directly linked to government policies (tariffs, spending cuts), supporting a Keynesian interpretation where government actions significantly influence economic sentiment and potentially trigger downturns.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions 'threats to the federal reserves independence after trump hinted at the termination of fed chair jerome powell' without detailing the nature of these 'threats' or the context of Trump's 'hint'. This omission is noteworthy because central bank independence is crucial for economic stability. What specific actions or statements constitute these 'threats', and what are the potential implications for market confidence if central bank autonomy is perceived to be compromised?; Intriguing_angles: The article twice states 'more americans now believe the economy will get worse than at any time since 2023'. This repetition, and the recent year 2023 as a negative benchmark, is unusual. Is this repetition an error, or is it intentional emphasis? Why is 2023 specifically highlighted? Does this reference point to a particular economic shift or policy change around that time that is being implicitly compared to the current situation, thus framing current pessimism as a significant recent decline?

  Title: Vatican Notes 'Exchange of Opinions' Over Migrants, Prisoners in Meeting With Vance
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-19 05:10:09)
  Content: vatican city ap u.s. vice president jd vance met saturday with the vaticans no. 2 official amid tensions over the u.s. crackdown on migrants, with the holy see reaffirming good relations but noting an exchange of opinions over current international conflicts, migrants and prisoners. vance, a catholic convert, met with the secretary of state, cardinal pietro parolin, and the foreign minister, archbishop paul gallagher, in the apostolic palace. there was no indication he met with pope francis, who has sharply cut back official duties during his recovery from pneumonia. vances office said he and parolin discussed their shared religious faith, catholicism in the united states, the plight of persecuted christian communities around the world, and president trumps commitment to restoring world peace. the holy see has responded cautiously to the trump administration while seeking to continue productive relations in keeping with its tradition of diplomatic neutrality. it has expressed alarm over the administrations crackdown on migrants and cuts in international aid while insisting on peaceful resolutions to the wars in ukraine and gaza. those concerns were reflected in the vatican statement, which said the talks were cordial and that the vatican expressed satisfaction with the administrations commitment to protecting freedom of religion and conscience. there was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners, the statement said. finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the state and the catholic church in the united states, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged. the reference to serene collaboration appeared to refer to vances assertion that the u.s. conference of catholic bishops was resettling illegal immigrants in order to get federal funding. top u.s. cardinals have pushed back strongly against the claim. it is clear that the approach of the current u.s. administration is very different from what we are used to and, especially in the west, from what we have relied on for many years, parolin told la repubblica daily on the eve of vances visit. as the u.s. pushes to end the war in ukraine, parolin reaffirmed kyivs right to its territorial integrity and insisted that any peace deal must not be imposed on ukraine but is built patiently, day by day, with dialogue and mutual respect. vance was spending easter weekend in rome with his family and attended good friday services in st. peters basilica after meeting with italian premier giorgia meloni. on saturday, after introducing his family to parolin, the vances got a private tour of the sistine chapel and later visited romes botanic garden, where one of his sons was seen in a plastic gladiator costume that is popular among italian kids. it wasnt immediately clear where they would celebrate easter. francis, for his part, indicated he hoped to attend easter mass that usually draws thousands to st. peters square, according to the official mass booklet and liturgical plans released saturday. papal rebuke on migration, appeal for prisoners francis and vance have tangled sharply over migration and the trump administrations plans to deport migrants en masse. francis has made caring for migrants a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative u.s. catholic church. francis also changed church teaching to say that capital punishment is inadmissible in all cases. after a public appeal from francis just weeks before trump took office, president joe biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row. trump is an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment. vance, who converted to catholicism in 2019, identifies with a small catholic intellectual movement, viewed by some critics as having reactionary or authoritarian leanings, that is often called postliberal. postliberals share some longstanding catholic conservative views, such as opposition to abortion and lgbtq rights. they envision a counterrevolution in which they take over government bureaucracy and institutions like universities from within, replacing entrenched elites with their own and acting upon their vision of the common good. just days before he was hospitalized in february, francis blasted the trump administrations deportation plans, warning that they would deprive migrants of their inherent dignity. in a letter to u.s. bishops, francis also appeared to respond to vance directly for having claimed that catholic doctrine justified such policies. a latin concept of love vance had defended the administrations america-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval catholic theology known in latin as ordo amoris. he has said the concept delineates a hierarchy of care to family first, followed by neighbor, community, fellow citizens and lastly those elsewhere. in his feb. 10 letter, francis appeared to correct vances understanding of the concept. christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups, he wrote. the true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the good samaritan, that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception. vance has acknowledged francis criticism but has said he would continue to defend his views. during a feb. 28 appearance at the national catholic prayer breakfast in washington, vance didnt address the issue specifically but called himself a baby catholic and acknowledged there are things about the faith that i dont know. while he had criticized francis on social media in the past, vance recently has posted prayers for francis recovery. ___ this version corrects the first name of gallagher. ___ associated press religion coverage receives support through the aps collaboration with the

expressed alarm over the administrations crackdown on migrants and cuts in international aid while insisting on peaceful resolutions to the wars in ukraine and gaza. those concerns were reflected in the vatican statement, which said the talks were cordial and that the vatican expressed satisfaction with the administrations commitment to protecting freedom of religion and conscience. there was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners, the statement said. finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the state and the catholic church in the united states, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged. the reference to serene collaboration appeared to refer to vances assertion that the u.s. conference of catholic bishops was resettling illegal immigrants in order to get federal funding. top u.s. cardinals have pushed back strongly against the claim. it is clear that the approach of the current u.s. administration is very different from what we are used to and, especially in the west, from what we have relied on for many years, parolin told la repubblica daily on the eve of vances visit. as the u.s. pushes to end the war in ukraine, parolin reaffirmed kyivs right to its territorial integrity and insisted that any peace deal must not be imposed on ukraine but is built patiently, day by day, with dialogue and mutual respect. vance was spending easter weekend in rome with his family and attended good friday services in st. peters basilica after meeting with italian premier giorgia meloni. on saturday, after introducing his family to parolin, the vances got a private tour of the sistine chapel and later visited romes botanic garden, where one of his sons was seen in a plastic gladiator costume that is popular among italian kids. it wasnt immediately clear where they would celebrate easter. francis, for his part, indicated he hoped to attend easter mass that usually draws thousands to st. peters square, according to the official mass booklet and liturgical plans released saturday. papal rebuke on migration, appeal for prisoners francis and vance have tangled sharply over migration and the trump administrations plans to deport migrants en masse. francis has made caring for migrants a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative u.s. catholic church. francis also changed church teaching to say that capital punishment is inadmissible in all cases. after a public appeal from francis just weeks before trump took office, president joe biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row. trump is an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment. vance, who converted to catholicism in 2019, identifies with a small catholic intellectual movement, viewed by some critics as having reactionary or authoritarian leanings, that is often called postliberal. postliberals share some longstanding catholic conservative views, such as opposition to abortion and lgbtq rights. they envision a counterrevolution in which they take over government bureaucracy and institutions like universities from within, replacing entrenched elites with their own and acting upon their vision of the common good. just days before he was hospitalized in february, francis blasted the trump administrations deportation plans, warning that they would deprive migrants of their inherent dignity. in a letter to u.s. bishops, francis also appeared to respond to vance directly for having claimed that catholic doctrine justified such policies. a latin concept of love vance had defended the administrations america-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval catholic theology known in latin as ordo amoris. he has said the concept delineates a hierarchy of care to family first, followed by neighbor, community, fellow citizens and lastly those elsewhere. in his feb. 10 letter, francis appeared to correct vances understanding of the concept. christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups, he wrote. the true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the good samaritan, that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception. vance has acknowledged francis criticism but has said he would continue to defend his views. during a feb. 28 appearance at the national catholic prayer breakfast in washington, vance didnt address the issue specifically but called himself a baby catholic and acknowledged there are things about the faith that i dont know. while he had criticized francis on social media in the past, vance recently has posted prayers for francis recovery. ___ this version corrects the first name of gallagher. ___ associated press religion coverage receives support through the aps collaboration with the

  Title: Stock market rallies after closed-door remarks by Treasury Secretary Bessent - Fortune
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 20:15:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: The recurring mentions of 'Trump tariffs' and 'Trump policy changes' alongside discussions of corporate hits (RTX), market reactions ('volatility spike', 'markets open sharply higher'), and geopolitical shifts ('softens on china', 'china de-escalation') align with aspects of Political Economy theory. This perspective suggests that political decisions and the actions of key political figures (like Trump) are not merely isolated events but have direct, measurable consequences on economic actors (companies like RTX, markets) and international economic relations (China trade). The text provides evidence of this linkage by explicitly connecting policy actions (tariffs, changes) to economic outcomes (hits, market shifts).; Theories_and_interpretations: The juxtaposition of headlines about market reactions to political statements ('investors are finally taking trump seriously', 'markets open sharply higher after trump softens') and the mention of 'agenda-setting' in the context of financial news (implied by the focus on specific topics like tariffs, Fed Chair, China) could be viewed through the lens of Agenda-Setting Theory. While typically applied to media influence on public perception, here it highlights how the *focus* of political figures (Trump's statements on China, Powell) can directly influence the *agenda* of financial markets and news coverage, demonstrating the power of political rhetoric to shape economic attention and action, as evidenced by the immediate market response described.; Intriguing_angles: The text mentions 'doges staffing cuts' as a cause for the IRS's 'nightmare' tax season and potential refund delays. The term 'doges' is unusual in this context and lacks clear identification as a standard entity type (Organization, Government Agency). Its significance lies in being presented as a direct causal factor for a major government agency's operational failure, yet its nature remains undefined within the article. What entity or concept does 'doges' represent in this context, and why is it presented as a singular, impactful cause without further clarification?

  Title: Pope Francis Converted to the Environmental Cause and Denounced Those He Blamed for Climate Change
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-22 10:01:36)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article illustrates how Pope Francis utilized his moral authority and platform, particularly through the encyclical 'Laudato Si'', to elevate climate change and its intersection with poverty onto the global agenda. The text notes the encyclical was 'written to inspire global negotiators' and was 'cited by presidents and scientists,' demonstrating a deliberate effort to influence international discourse and policy priorities by a non-state actor with significant soft power.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article's description of the encyclical's critique of the 'profit-driven economy of the global north' causing harm to the 'poor, indigenous peoples and islanders' aligns with core tenets of Dependency Theory or World-Systems Theory. It frames the environmental crisis not merely as a technical problem but as a consequence of structural inequalities in the global economic system, where the periphery bears the cost of core activities, as evidenced by the quote that the poor 'contributed the least to pollution... but were paying the highest price.'

  Content: vatican city ap few moments in pope francis papacy better exemplify his understanding of climate change and the need to address it than the rain-soaked mass he celebrated in tacloban, philippines, in 2015. wearing one of the cheap plastic yellow ponchos that were handed out to the faithful, francis experienced first-hand the type of freak, extreme storms that scientists blame on global warming and are increasingly striking vulnerable, low-lying islands. he had traveled to tacloban, on the island of leyte, to comfort survivors of one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, typhoon haiyan. the 2013 storm killed more than 7,300 people, flattened villages and displaced about 5 million residents. but with another storm approaching tacloban two years later, francis had to cut short his visit to get off the island. so many of you have lost everything. i dont know what to tell you, francis told the crowd in taclobans muddy airport field as the wind nearly toppled candlesticks on the altar. francis, who died monday at 88, was moved to silence that day by the survivors pain and the devastation he saw. but he would channel it a few months later when he published his landmark encyclical, praised be, which cast care for the planet as an urgent and existential moral concern. the first ecological encyclical the document, written to inspire global negotiators at the 2015 paris climate talks, accused the structurally perverse, profit-driven economy of the global north of ravaging earth and turning it into a pile of filth. the poor, indigenous peoples and islanders like those in tacloban suffered the most, he argued, bearing the brunt of increasing droughts, extreme storms, deforestation and pollution. it was the first ecological encyclical, and it affirmed the argentine jesuit, who in his youth studied to be a chemist, as an authoritative voice in the environmental movement. later cited by presidents and scientists, the document inspired a global faith-based coalition to try to save gods creation before it was too late. i think he understood from the beginning that there are three relationships that had to be regenerated our relationship with god, our relationship with the created world and our relationship with our fellow creatures, said papal biographer austen ivereigh. it wasnt always so. a conversion in 2007 in brazil francis had a steep learning curve on the environment, just as he did with clergy sexual abuse, which he initially dismissed as overblown. he himself pointed to a 2007 meeting of latin american and caribbean bishops in aparecida, brazil, as the moment of his ecological awakening. there, the then-cardinal jorge mario bergoglio had been elected to draft the conferences final document, and was under pressure to include calls from brazilian bishops to highlight the plight of the amazon. bergoglio, the dour-faced archbishop of urbane buenos aires, didnt get what all the fuss was about. at first i was a bit annoyed, francis wrote in the 2020 book let us dream. it struck me as excessive. by the end of the meeting, bergoglio was converted and convinced. the final aparecida document devoted several sections to the environment it denounced multinational extraction companies that plundered the regions resources at the expense of the poor. it warned of melting glaciers and the effects of lost biodiversity. it cast the ravaging of the planet as an assault on gods divine plan that violated the biblical imperative to cultivate and care for creation. those same issues would later find prominence in praised be, which took its name from the repeated first line of the canticle of the creatures, one of the best-known poetic songs of the pontiffs nature-loving namesake, st. francis of assisi. they also would be highlighted in the amazon synod that francis called at the vatican in 2019, a meeting of bishops and indigenous peoples specifically to address how the catholic church could and should respond to the plight of the amazon and its impoverished people. i think the popes most important contribution was to insist on the ethical aspect of the debate about climate justice, said giuseppe onofrio, head of greenpeace italy, that the poor were those who contributed the least to pollution and the climate crisis, but were paying the highest price. how the environment affects all other ills in many ways, those same issues would also come to define much of francis papacy. he came to view the environmental cause as encapsulating nearly all the other ills afflicting humanity in the 21st century poverty, social and economic injustice, migration and what he called the throwaway culture a melting pot of problems that he was convinced could only be addressed holistically. some of francis strongest calls to protect the environment would come on or around earth day, celebrated april 22. for some time now, we have been becoming more aware that nature deserves to be protected, even if only because human interaction with gods biodiversity must take care with utmost care and respect, francis said in a video message released on earth day in 2021. cardinal michael czerny, the canadian jesuit whom francis would later entrust with the ecological dossier, said the 2007 meeting in brazil had a big impact on francis. in aparecida, listening to so many different bishops talking about what was deteriorating, but also what the people were suffering, i think really impressed him, said czerny. czernys mandate encapsulated francis vision of integral ecology, covering the environment, the vaticans response to the covid-19 pandemic, its charitable caritas federation, migration advocacy, economic development and its antinuclear campaign. the multifaceted approach was intentional, czerny said, to establish new thinking about ecology that went beyond the politicized concept of green advocacy to something bigger and nonnegotiable humanitys relationship with god and creation. everything is connected, francis liked to say. a legacy from pope paul vi he was by no means the first pope to embrace the ecological cause. according to the book the popes and ecology, pope paul vi was the first pontiff to refer to an ecological catastrophe in a 1970 speech to a u.n. food agency. st. john paul ii largely ignored the environment, though he did write the first truly ecological manifesto his 1990 world day of peace message, which linked consumer lifestyle with environmental decay. pope benedict xvi was known as the green pope, primarily for having installed solar panels on the vatican auditorium and starting a tree-planting campaign to offset the greenhouse gas emissions of vatican city. francis issued an update to praised be in 2023, just before the u.n. climate conference in dubai. while consistent with the original text, the update was even more dire and showed francis had grown more urgent in his alarm. he became even more willing to point fingers at the worlds biggest emitters of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, especially the u.s. and he called out those, including in the church, who denied the human causes of global warming. he showed that he had an understanding of what was happening in the world, and he saw the world from the point of view, as he was like to say, of the peripheries, of the margins, said ivereigh, the papal biographer. he brought the margins into the center. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: PROTESTS ACROSS NATION...
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-06 19:25:36)
  Content: crowds of people angry about the way president donald trump is running the country marched and rallied in scores of american cities saturday in the biggest day of demonstrations yet by an opposition movement trying to regain its momentum after the shock of the republicans first weeks in office. so-called hands off! demonstrations were organized for more than 1,200 locations in all 50 states by more than 150 groups, including civil rights organizations, labor unions, lbgtq advocates, veterans and elections activists. the rallies appeared peaceful, with no immediate reports of arrests. pro-palestinian protesters carrying a depiction of president donald trump gather at a rally before marching toward the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ice headquarters, saturday, april 5, 2025, in washington. ap photomanuel balce ceneta thousands of protesters in cities dotting the nation from midtown manhattan to anchorage, alaska, including at multiple state capitols, assailed trump and billionaire elon musk s actions on government downsizing, the economy, immigration and human rights. on the west coast, in the shadow of seattles iconic space needle, protesters held signs with slogans like fight the oligarchy. protesters chanted as they took to the streets in portland, oregon, and los angeles, where they marched from pershing square to city hall. demonstrators voiced anger over the administrations moves to fire thousands of federal workers, close social security administration field offices, effectively shutter entire agencies, deport immigrants, scale back protections for transgender people and cut funding for health programs. musk, a trump adviser who runs tesla, spacex and the social media platform x, has played a key role in the downsizing as the head of the newly created department of government efficiency. he says he is saving taxpayers billions of dollars. asked about the protests, the white house said in a statement that president trumps position is clear he will always protect social security, medicare, and medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. meanwhile, the democrats stance is giving social security, medicaid, and medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush american seniors. kelley robinson, president of the human rights campaign advocacy group, criticized the administrations treatment of the lbgtq community at the rally at the national mall in washington, d.c., where democratic members of congress also took the stage. the attacks that were seeing, theyre not just political. they are personal, yall, robinson said. theyre trying to ban our books, theyre slashing hiv prevention funding, theyre criminalizing our doctors, our teachers, our families and our lives. we dont want this america, yall, robinson added. we want the america we deserve, where dignity, safety and freedom belong not to some of us, but to all of us. in boston, demonstrators brandished signs such as hands off our democracy and hands off our social security. mayor michelle wu said she does not want her children and others to live in a world in which threats and intimidation are government tactics and values like diversity and equality are under attack. activists protest president donald trump, who was a few miles away at his trump national golf club, during a hands off!

  Title: Defending Migrants Was a Priority for Pope Francis From the Earliest Days of His Papacy
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-22 10:04:24)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory: The article demonstrates how Pope Francis, a prominent non-state actor, repeatedly attempted to force the issue of migrant suffering onto the global political agenda, particularly by directly challenging powerful state actors like the US. The text highlights his consistent actions ('repeatedly took up the plight,' 'spoke out,' 'assailed US plans') and the reactions from political figures ('Trump... responded,' 'Homan... pushed back'), illustrating the struggle for control over the public discourse and policy focus surrounding migration, where Francis sought to elevate humanitarian concerns against dominant state security narratives.; Theories_and_interpretations: Realism vs. Humanitarianism: The conflict depicted between Pope Francis's humanitarian appeals and the actions of state actors (US, European policymakers) can be viewed through a realist lens contrasting with humanitarian principles. States are described as implementing 'increasingly restrictive policies,' 'border initiatives,' and 'mass deportations' driven by factors like 'declining public empathy' and 'public anger,' suggesting a prioritization of perceived national interests (security, border control, domestic political concerns). Francis's advocacy represents a challenge to this state-centric approach based on universal human dignity, highlighting the tension between state sovereignty/interest and non-state humanitarian norms.; Intriguing_angles: Textual Clue: The article notes Francis's meeting with Vice President JD Vance occurred 'on the day before his death,' immediately following a mention of their prior 'tangling long-distance over deportation plans.' Significance: This specific timing is presented factually but is highly suggestive, placing a final interaction with a political adversary on a contentious issue in the immediate shadow of death. It prompts consideration of the nature and potential significance of that specific, final conversation. Probing Question: What was the specific content or tone of the final meeting between Francis and Vance, and did the timing of this encounter hold any particular symbolic or substantive weight regarding their differing views on migration?; Intriguing_angles: Textual Clue: The article attributes restrictive policies to factors like 'declining public empathy' and the 'rise of the anti-immigration far-right,' presenting these as contexts for state actions. Significance: While identifying these factors, the text does not explore *why* public empathy declined or the specific mechanisms by which the 'far-right' gained influence beyond general links to migration concerns. This leaves the underlying societal and political dynamics driving these shifts largely unexamined within the narrative. Probing Question: What specific societal or political processes contributed to the described 'declining public empathy' and the 'rise of the anti-immigration far-right,' and how might understanding these mechanisms provide a more complete picture of the forces shaping migration policy?

  Content: advocating for migrants was one of pope francis top priorities. his papacy saw a refugee crisis in the mediterranean, skyrocketing numbers of migrants in the americas, and declining public empathy that led to increasingly restrictive policies around the world. francis repeatedly took up the plight of migrants from bringing asylum-seekers to the vatican with him from overcrowded island camps to denouncing border initiatives of u.s. president donald trump. on the day before his death, francis briefly met with vice president jd vance, with whom he had tangled long-distance over deportation plans. some memorable moments when francis spoke out to defend migrants july 8, 2013, lampedusa, italy for his first pastoral visit outside rome following his election, francis traveled to the italian island of lampedusa a speck in the mediterranean whose proximity to north africa put it on the front line of many smuggling routes and deadly shipwrecks. meeting migrants who had been in libya, he decried their suffering and denounced the globalization of indifference that met those who risked their lives trying to reach europe. a decade later, in a september 2023 visit to the multicultural french port of marseille, francis again blasted the fanaticism of indifference toward migrants as european policymakers doubled down on borders amid the rise of the anti-immigration far-right. april 16, 2016, lesbos, greece francis traveled to the greek island of lesbos at the height of a refugee crisis in which hundreds of thousands of people arrived after fleeing civil war in syria and other conflicts in the middle east and south asia. he brought three muslim families to italy on the papal plane. rescuing those 12 syrians from an overwhelmed island camp was a drop of water in the sea. but after this drop, the sea will never be the same, francis said. during his hospitalization in early 2025, one of those families that settled in rome said francis didnt just change their lives. he wanted to begin a global dialogue to let world leaders know that even an undocumented migrant is not something to fear, said hasan zaheda. his wife, nour essa, added he fought to broadcast migrant voices, to explain that migrants in the end are just human beings who have suffered in wars. the news of francis death shocked the family and they mourned with the whole of humanity, zaheda said. in december 2021, francis again had a dozen asylum-seekers brought to italy, this time following his visit to cyprus. feb. 17, 2016, at the us-mexico border celebrating a mass near the u.s. border in ciudad juarez, mexico, that was beamed live to neighboring el paso, texas, francis prayed for open hearts when faced with the human tragedy that is forced migration. answering a reporters question while flying back to rome, francis said a person who advocates building walls is not christian. trump, at the time a presidential candidate, was campaigning to do just that, and responded that it was disgraceful to question a persons faith. he criticized the pope for not understanding the danger of the open border that we have with mexico. oct. 24, 2021, vatican city as pressures surged in italy and elsewhere in europe to crack down on illegal migration, francis made an impassioned plea to end the practice of returning those people rescued at sea to libya and other unsafe countries where they suffer inhumane violence. he called detention facilities in libya true concentration camps. from there, thousands of migrants are taken by traffickers on often unseaworthy vessels. the mediterranean sea has become the worlds largest migrant grave with more than 30,000 deaths since 2014, when the international organization for migrations missing migrants project began counting. feb. 12, 2025, vatican city after trump returned to the white house in part by riding a wave of public anger at illegal immigration, francis assailed u.s. plans for mass deportations, calling them a disgrace. with trump making a flurry of policy changes cracking down on immigration practices, francis wrote to u.s. bishops and warned that deportations will end badly. the act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women, he wrote. u.s. border czar tom homan immediately pushed back, noting the vatican is a city-state surrounded by walls and that francis should leave border enforcement to his office. when vance visited over easter weekend, he first met with the vaticans secretary of state, cardinal pietro parolin. afterward, the holy see reaffirmed cordial relations and common interests, but noted an exchange of opinions over current international conflicts, migrants and prisoners. ___ associated press religion coverage receives support through the aps collaboration with the conversation us,

  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism is relevant here. The article shows states (Israel, Palestine) reacting to the death of a moral authority (Pope Francis) based on their perceived national interests. Abbas mourns him as a 'friend of the Palestinian people,' while Herzog focuses on his 'ties with the Jewish world.' This highlights how even grief is filtered through the lens of state-centric concerns and ongoing conflict.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions the Pope's suggestion that Israel's actions might constitute genocide, which was denounced by an Israeli minister. This is a strong accusation, yet the article doesn't delve into the details of this denouncement or the evidence supporting/refuting the genocide claim. What were the specific reasons for the denouncement? What evidence exists to support or refute the genocide claim, and why is it omitted here?

  Title: Contributor: Pope Francis' enduring message — unite to heal God's Earth
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-22 10:01:10)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory is relevant because the article contrasts Pope Francis's consistent focus on climate change with the Trump administration's different framing of environmental issues. The article states, 'by the time pope francis assumed the papacy, one of st. francis central devotions, the environment, was already heavily politicized because of climate change' and 'president trump and his allies do not communicate about nature, pollution and climate change in such terms.' This suggests a deliberate effort to shift public attention away from climate change as a critical issue, potentially influencing public perception and policy priorities.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions the 'role of greed endemic to the ecological crisis' in Pope Francis's writings, but doesn't elaborate on specific examples or mechanisms. This omission is intriguing because it leaves the reader to infer the connection between greed and environmental damage. What specific economic practices or policies might Pope Francis be implicitly criticizing? How does this framing of greed influence the perception of responsibility for environmental issues?

  Content: pope francis, born jorge mario bergoglio, honored francis of assisi with the name he selected for himself when he was elected as pope in 2013. the popes namesake, saint francis, remains widely venerated by catholics nearly 800 years after his death, not only for his commitment to the natural world but because of his deep devotion to jesus christ as well as his ministry to poor people, including the establishment of the franciscan order. by the time pope francis assumed the papacy, one of st. francis central devotions, the environment, was already heavily politicized because of climate change. the pope often spoke directly to both the issue and the context, addressing failures of world leadership and calling for policy reform, including in preparation of remarks for the united nations annual climate conference held in dubai in 2023. that year, i began analyzing francis commentary on the environment, and the year after, as the presidential election neared, i started examining the language used on this subject by donald trump and other republican leaders. francis writings touch on many facets of climate change, including the intersection between science and religion, the need for cultural change in the way humans interact with creation and the role of greed endemic to the ecological crisis, as he termed it. in laudato si praise be on the care of our common home, his landmark climate encyclical, he asked, is it realistic to hope that those who are obsessed with maximizing profits will stop to reflect on the environmental damage which they will leave behind for future generations? where profits alone count, there can be no thinking about the rhythms of nature, its phases of decay and regeneration, or the complexity of ecosystems which may be gravely upset by human intervention. president trump and his allies do not communicate about nature, pollution and climate change in such terms. when they address the role of fossil-fuel or corporate interests and the environment, it tends to be summarized as drill, baby, drill. the trump administration is actively encouraging human intervention in nature and dismissing climate science. and yet, the president and other republicans also emphasize the importance of ensuring that americans have access to clean air and clean water. this is, in fact, what francis wanted, too, for all people. in his message for the catholic churchs world youth day 10 years ago, he put it this way we need to show a healthy concern for creation, for the purity of our air, water, and food. is this not what americans desire as well? according to a recent gallup poll, the ideologies of the american left and right are the most polarized they have been in the last 30 years. but nature, clean air and clean water are all issues everyone can rally around. on earth day, may the passing of pope francis allow us a moment to reflect upon this, and upon his words, including those written for the climate conference in dubai i too, who bear the name francis, with the heartfelt urgency of a prayer, want to leave you with this message let us leave behind our divisions and unite our forces! and with gods help, let us emerge from the dark night of wars and environmental devastation in order to turn our common future into the dawn of a new and radiant day. allison agsten is the director of the center for climate journalism and communication, at uscs annenberg school for communication and journalism.

This suggests these organizations are actively shaping the narrative and priorities within the U.S. Catholic community, potentially influencing public opinion and policy debates.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions a decline in Pope Francis's favorability among U.S. Catholics, dropping from 90% in 2015 to 75% in 2024. This is a significant shift. What specific factors, beyond the broad ideological clashes mentioned, contributed to this decline? Could targeted campaigns or specific events have played a disproportionate role in shaping public perception?; Intriguing_angles: The article notes that a U.S. cardinal has never been elected Pope because the Vatican sees the U.S. as having outsized influence. This is a noteworthy statement. What specific aspects of U.S. influence are perceived as problematic by the Vatican? Does this reflect concerns about cultural dominance, financial power, or political alignment?

  Content: new headline new york reuters - when pope francis visited the united states in 2015, cheering crowds of catholics and non-catholics turned out in new york, washington and philadelphia to greet him, lifting hopes that the u.s. church was about to enter a new, vibrant era. it turned out to be a period of deep discord. in the decade since that visit, an increasingly vocal and conservative segment of the u.s. church clashed with francis over everything from immigration to climate change and same-sex couples. over time, the conservative influence helped shape opinions of u.s. catholics more broadly about 75 of u.s. catholics viewed francis favorably in 2024, down from a high of about 90 in 2015. francis died at the age of 88 on monday. the growing cultural and political sway of conservatives within the u.s. catholic church was underscored by the strong support for donald trump in last years presidential elections, despite hardline policies that conflicted with those of francis. catholics voted for trump 59-39 over democrat kamala harris, a 12 percentage point swing from 2020, according to exit polling by edison research. trumps victory set up instances of conflict between the white house and the vatican. francis called trumps plans to deport millions of migrants a disgrace, and criticized his cuts to foreign aid and domestic welfare programs. in a letter to american bishops, francis also seemed to rebut the theological concept used by vice president jd vance, who became a catholic in 2019, to justify the immigration crackdown. vance and francis met briefly on sunday, hours before the popes death in what the vatican described as a cordial exchange of easter greetings. both trump and vance expressed condolences on monday. as francis health deteriorated in his final weeks, some u.s. catholics expressed admiration for the popes legacy, portraying his papacy as one of much-needed modernization. i know he gets a lot of hate for being more progressive, said carson doss, 24, of new york. maybe its because im young but i dont have a problem with it. my parents arent the biggest fans. us church an outlier david gibson, director of fordham university center on religion and culture, a catholic university in new york, described the growing traditionalism of the u.s. church as an outlier within global catholicism and increasingly so. according to experts, the traditional movement within the u.s. church - while not dominant in the pews - expanded its reach and influence through organizations such as eternal word television network, a catholic broadcaster, and the napa institute, a group formed in 2010 that hosts conferences attended by clergy, business executives and political leaders, often focused on a conservative social agenda. those organizations and other conservative leaders at times took issue with the popes focus on topics such as climate change, while resisting his calls to limit latin mass, balking at approval of conditional blessings for same-sex couples, and bristling at his informal style. those sentiments were echoed by conservatives in the pews. i didnt really like the pope, said jeff pfaff, 39, of new yorks staten island. pfaff said he disagreed with francis stance on u.s. immigration and allowing priests to perform same-sex marriage blessings. dont shove it down my throat, he said, adding that he generally goes to church about three times a month. francis stocked the church leadership with cardinals from places that had never had them before, such as tonga, haiti and mongolia, broadening representation beyond the catholic churchs stronghold in europe. they have a similar understanding of the church as francis, a similar understanding of the mission, to care for the environment, care for migrants and refugees, and care for the excluded and the downtrodden, said tom groome, a professor of theology at boston college, a catholic institution, cautioning, however, theyre not all replicas of francis. conservative u.s. cardinals may align with similarly minded adherents of the faith from africa during the conclave in hopes of choosing a conservative to succeed francis, according to massimo faggioli, a professor of religious studies at villanova university, a catholic college in pennsylvania. the names of a few u.s. bishops have surfaced as possible contenders for pope including cardinal joseph tobin of newark, archbishop robert mcelroy of washington and cardinal blase cupich of chicago. all three were close to francis, faggioli said. but a u.s. cardinal has never been elected pope, partly because the vatican sees the u.s. as having outsized influence in the church, experts said. this story has been refiled to change the headline reporting by jessica dinapoli in new york editing by paul thomasch and suzanne goldenberg

  Title: Father Richard Estrada, defender of the downtrodden, dead at 83
  Source: www.latimes.com (2025-04-03 10:00:41)
  Content: he was one of the greatest human beings that ive run across in my lifetime, actor edward james olmos said of father richard estrada, shown here at his la placita church. father richard estrada, a leading figure in the immigrant rights movement who was known for opening los angeles first shelter for homeless migrant youth and dedicating his life to advocating for the downtrodden, died monday at the age of 83. estrada was hospitalized in march for pneumonia after contracting covid-19, and he died from covid-related complications, according to angie jimenez, a family friend. estrada, the son of mexican immigrants, was born in los angeles on march 1, 1942. his father worked as a welder and his mother cleaned office buildings. he devoted his adult years to championing the causes of people he believed were treated as second-class citizens, including immigrants, farmworkers, women and members of the lgbtq community. estrada was a tireless advocate for migrants who crossed into the u.s. illegally to flee violence and poverty, find work and provide for their families. over 30 years of activism, he helped deliver thousands of gallons of water to migrants traversing the desert along the border, offered his church as sanctuary for people threatened with deportation, and mortgaged his home to raise money for jovenes inc., the nonprofit migrant youth organization he founded. from 1977 to 2014, estrada served as an associate pastor at our lady queen of angels, a catholic church known as la placita, before leaving to join the episcopal church, saying he felt its tenets better aligned with his values. father richard estrada was a visionary, andrea marchetti, executive director of jovenes, said. his sense of humanity and his unconditional commitment and love for the most vulnerable were the guiding principles for all the actions he led, no matter the challenges he faced in his later years. jovenes inc. began organically as estrada, in the late 1980s, started seeing young migrants showing up at his church on olvera street without parents or support. he opened his home in east los angeles to many of them before founding jovenes in 1989. with estradas support, the operation has flourished and expanded over the years into a vibrant boyle heights campus offering a continuum of services spanning housing, healthcare, education and career development for 700 young people, ages 18 to 24. in a 2015 profile, he told the times that he was guided by the concept of la posada meaning inn or lodging. im into giving shelter, he told reporter kate linthicum. california great read activist l.a. priest follows religion of acceptance armed with a bottle of water and a baseball cap, father richard estrada made his way slowly to the border in the scorching heat. at la placita, he opened the churchs doors to shelter migrant youth during a time of tense discourse about immigration, and federal officials accused him of promoting illegal behavior. he handcuffed himself to a federal building to bring attention to the plight of immigrants in detention, the first of about a dozen times he would be arrested for civil disobedience, jimenez said. his last arrest happened in 2023, at age 81, as he marched for workers rights. he also opened his la placita church to weekly hiv testing, working with richard zaldivar, founder of the wall las memorias project, at a time when the catholic church was not welcoming to the lgbtq community. zaldivar remembers asking estrada if he was worried about getting in trouble. he was like a shooting star he didnt give a damn, zaldivar recalled. he inspired so many people to believe that you could change the community and change systems by raising your voice and organizing. he also inspired people to believe in their faith faith in god, but also the faith in yourself that you can create a better community. in the 1970s, estrada organized for farmworker rights alongside cesar chavez and dolores huerta, participating in marches for the united farm workers and organizing grape boycotts in east los angeles. he was a key figure in the chicano movement, lending his stature as a religious leader to advocate for underserved communities. when he advocated to open the first shelter for undocumented youth, hundreds of people showed up in opposition, recalled state sen. maria elena durazo, who represents central and east l.a. he remained calm, understanding their fears, but reminding everyone about our humanity. actor edward james olmos said he got to know estrada through their shared interests in immigrant rights and speaking to incarcerated youth. over the years, estrada leaned on olmos to support various causes, and olmos often answered that call. ok, father, were on our way, he would tell estrada. olmos said he remembers estrada voicing frustrations as it grew clear that ranking members of the catholic church had covered up sexual abuse of children, an episode that contributed to his decision to leave the institution and another example of his conviction to speak his mind. he was one of the greatest human beings that ive run across in my lifetime, olmos said. as a minister at the church of the epiphany, an episcopal church in lincoln heights, estrada baptized jimenez when she was a child, and later baptized her two daughters. he was present through difficult moments, she said, including her sisters death, offering comfort and guidance. it was almost like you were next to a saint. when you were around him it was one of the most comforting feelings, she said. estrada remained an active presence at jovenes as board president until early this year. just after his birthday on march 1, he fell ill and was diagnosed with covid-19 and pneumonia, jimenez said. he died on cesar chavez day.

Historical Article 16 (ID: 130873):
  Title: Pope Francis was a globalist in an age of nationalists
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-22 14:10:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article's consistent focus on the ideological conflict between 'globalism' (represented by Francis) and 'nationalism' (represented by Trump, Vance, and others) suggests this framing is central to how the information is presented. Phrases like 'the anti-globalist mission is at the heart of president donald trumps second term' and 'contempt for the globalist agenda also shaped right-wing criticism of pope francis' highlight this divide, making it a primary lens for the reader to interpret the various events and statements discussed. This emphasis shapes the perceived importance of this ideological struggle in contemporary affairs.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article implicitly contrasts a Realist approach to state action with a more universalist perspective. Trump's actions, such as withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and gutting aid, are explicitly linked to 'narrow national self-interest'. This aligns with Political Realism, where states prioritize their own perceived gains above international cooperation or moral appeals. Francis's calls for 'globalization of solidarity' and prioritizing the 'common good' stand in direct opposition, highlighting the tension between state-centric self-interest and a cosmopolitan view of global responsibility as presented in the text.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Francis's apology for 16th-century atrocities by Spanish conquistadors and the Vox party spokesperson's reaction questioning an 'argentine nationality' pope apologizing for 'others'. Textual Basis: 'The pontiffs decision in 2021 to apologize for the 16th century atrocities carried out in the new world by spanish conquistadors in the name of the catholic church provoked anger in spain, with a spokesperson for the far-right vox party scoffing i do not understand how a pope of argentine nationality can apologize on behalf of others.' Significance: This detail, seemingly historical, is used to illustrate contemporary political framing. The reaction highlights how national identity and historical events are interpreted and potentially weaponized within current political debates, particularly against figures perceived as 'globalist'. Probing Questions: How does the article's inclusion of this historical event and reaction serve to reinforce the contemporary political conflicts it describes? What does the emphasis on Francis's 'argentine nationality' in the Vox quote suggest about the underlying tensions being highlighted?; Intriguing_angles: The text notes JD Vance's use of the concept 'ordo amoris' to frame his nativism and states that Francis 'had little time for such arguments'. Textual Basis: 'in the early weeks of this trump presidency, vance attempted to frame his nativism in medieval catholic terms, citing the concept of ordo amoris... Up to his last days, francis had little time for such arguments.' Significance: This specific interaction reveals a struggle over the interpretation and application of traditional religious/philosophical concepts in modern political discourse. Vance attempts to legitimize a political stance (nativism) through selective appeal to tradition, while the religious authority figure (Francis) dismisses this application, suggesting a deeper conflict over defining values. Probing Questions: What does Vance's attempt to use 'ordo amoris' reveal about the strategies employed to bridge religious identity and political ideology? How does Francis's reported reaction challenge or validate the use of religious concepts in political arguments as presented here?

  Content: youre reading an excerpt from the worldview newsletter. sign up to get the rest, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox on mondays, wednesdays and fridays. the term globalist is mostly invoked in the pejorative. the wests right-wing nationalists, in particular, have for years laid the failures and ills of their societies at the feet of globalists conjuring a caricature of well-heeled, jet-setting elites who pursue multinational capital and cosmopolitan schemes supposedly at the expense of their countrymen. the anti-globalist mission is at the heart of president donald trumps second term it looms over the administrations moves to deport undocumented migrants and foreign students, and animates trumps protectionist zeal as he tries to reconfigure the global economic order through sweeping tariffs. contempt for the globalist agenda also shaped right-wing criticism of pope francis, the venerable argentine jesuit cleric who died monday after suffering a stroke and cardiocirculatory collapse. his support for the rights of migrants, activism over climate change and qualified acceptance of homosexuality saw u.s. right-wingers cast francis as a woke pope, sympathetic to the liberation theology of the americas reviled by vatican traditionalists and western conservatives. erstwhile trump adviser stephen k. bannon once told far-right counterparts in europe to view the pontiff as the enemy. the lepanto institute, an ultraconservative catholic think tank that raged against the francis pontificate, frequently insisted the pope was doing the work of communists. the pontiffs decision in 2021 to apologize for the 16th century atrocities carried out in the new world by spanish conquistadors in the name of the catholic church provoked anger in spain, with a spokesperson for the far-right vox party scoffing i do not understand how a pope of argentine nationality can apologize on behalf of others. francis was not spared the ire of fellow argentines, either, as ultralibertarian argentine president javier milei declared in an interview before taking office that the pope was a representative of the evil left. milei has since been more conciliatory, and waved away at their minor differences in a statement mourning the death of francis. leaders around the globe offered condolences for the loss of pope francis on april 21. video reuters its a small irony that one of pope franciss last major meetings was with vice president jd vance, a convert to catholicism who has since styled himself as a postliberal nationalist, in a nod to a particular tradition of reactionary catholic thinking. in the early weeks of this trump presidency, vance attempted to frame his nativism in medieval catholic terms, citing the concept of ordo amoris, or order of love or charity, that suggested one had a greater obligation to those closer to you than farther away. up to his last days, francis had little time for such arguments. the act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness, he wrote in a recent letter to u.s. bishops. in trumps first term, francis suggested the white houses building of border walls and separation of asylum-seeking parents from their children made the president not christian. the popes easter address delivered this weekend by a surrogate bemoaned the hatreds of any increasingly illiberal age. how much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalized and migrants, the text said. i appeal to all those in positions of political responsibility in our world not to yield to the logic of fear. francis spent years doggedly trying to counter this fear of the stranger. he washed the feet of arab migrants seeking asylum in europe. he begged forgiveness of rohingya muslims in a public ceremony after critics accused him of not doing enough to champion their plight during a 2017 visit to myanmar, whose authorities treat the persecuted minority as stateless interlopers. and he broke with papal precedent to argue in 2023 against secular antigay laws and said being homosexual is not a crime. his was the image of the good samaritan, and through him, the image he gave of the church was of a good samaritan, marco politi, a papal biographer and longtime vatican watcher, told my colleagues. selecting a new pope is a centuries-old process involving rounds of secretive voting, speeches, prayers and a dose of political maneuvering. video sarah hashemi, joe snellthe washington post francis saw himself as a globalist, but not in the terms laid out by those who revile globalism. in an address last year to the world economic forum that bastion of globalists he said the process of globalization had made clear the interdependence of the worlds nations and peoples and therefore carried a fundamentally moral dimension. he called on states and businesses to promote far-sighted and ethically sound models of globalization and to subordinate the pursuit of power and individual gain in the cause of a greater common good. in 2018, he urged the globalization of solidarity, appealing for support for the poor and those stranded in warzones or mired in humanitarian disasters. such entreaties have often gone unheeded and seem wholly at odds with the worldview of the white house, where trump has invoked narrow national self-interest to justify the gutting of u.s. humanitarian aid to the rest of word and the slashing of environmental regulations and pledges. in 2017, francis gifted trump a copy of his 192-page encyclical on ecology that noted the solid scientific consensus about human-driven climate change and called for dramatic action to reduce carbon-based emissions. the u.s. president never much of a reader didnt seem to take the message to heart, as he later pulled the united states out of the paris climate agreement. francis was elected by conclave in 2013, after many countries that were home to the planets 1.4 billion catholics had lurched out of the global financial crisis. but the ensuing years have seen waves of crises and instability. international diplomacy failed to stop hideous wars across the globe, including in ukraine and gaza where francis has long called for a lasting ceasefire. an epochal pandemic convulsed the world. in western democracies, economic inequality expanded, the liberal establishment kept crumbling and angry right-wing populism came to the fore. its unclear which cardinal will follow francis, but theres a possibility an ultraconservative backlash could yield a more doctrinaire successor. such a figure would be less adversarial with trump and vance, but would remind others of what has been lost in this popes passing.

  Title: Mass protests across the U.S. signal opposition to Trump, Musk
  Source: www.washingtonpost.com (2025-04-05 18:04:46)
  Content: tens of thousands of people crowded in front of the washington monument and in cities across the nation on saturday to protest president donald trump and top adviser elon musks dismantling of federal agencies, imposition of sweeping tariffs and what demonstrators called the circumvention of due process. organizers said at least 1,300 hands off rallies were planned by more than 150 groups in all 50 states. photos and videos on social media showed throngs gathered in public squares or marching through the streets from boston to los angeles. rallygoers dressed in statue of liberty costumes, waved anti-trump flags and had their canines wear dogs against doge collars. in the freezing rain in providence, rhode island, they carried signs decrying the administrations deportation efforts. under sunny skies in atlanta, home to the centers for disease control and prevention, they blasted the defunding of public health. and on a beach in san francisco, they formed a human banner to send a message to the president hands off democracy! protesters rallied across the u.s on april 5 in what organizers say is the largest single-day demonstrations against president trump and elon musk. video the washington post in washington, the crowd swelled as far as the eye could see from all sides of the stage on the national mall. no moral person wants an economy-crashing dictator who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing, rep. jamie raskin d-maryland declared, laying into the trump administration for the stock market downturn, attacks on law firms and close relations with international dictators. organizers said they hoped saturdays events would be the largest trump protests since he returned to office in january. in their permit application to the national park service, rally organizers in d.c. said they anticipated a crowd of 10,000. by friday night, though, the organizers said they expected at least 20,000. saturday afternoon, they were estimating the crowd was five times as big as they predicted. the white house postponed spring garden tours scheduled for saturday because of the potential size of the event. police began closing streets around the national mall on saturday afternoon as the crowd swelled beyond the figures predicted by organizers. political protesting was a new experience for jac behrends, a 28-year-old livestock farmer from new yorks hudson valley. she drove down at 430 a.m. to be there. shes never been particularly political, but seeing musk mimic a nazi salute and seeing trumps rhetoric sway her mom into fearing immigrants spurred her to action, she said. i wanted to be at the heart of it, and d.c. is definitely the heart of it, behrends said. i really hate that billionaires and the rich are in control of our political system. that is not what this country was founded on. people gathered in response to what they see as the administrations overreach on a variety of issues nato schools libraries courts veteran services fair elections and, organizers said, our jobs, our wallets, our bodies. britt jacovich, a spokesperson for the liberal group moveon.org, which was one of the organizers, said people not only want trump to get his hands off abortion rights and civil rights issues, they want his hands off social security, medicare, medicaid, the federal workforce, the value of their 401k, the broader u.s. economy, and much more. jacovich said the breadth of the groups organizing reflects the growing opposition to trump, musk and the republican party in washington. she recalls how shes in group chats with friends and family in which everyone was watching their 401ks plummet in real time. if youre worried about donald trump or elon musk or the republican party, this rally is for you, she said. during trumps first term, protests tended to concentrate in washington but organizers want to spread the rallies out around the country, jacovich said. many of smaller rallies are forming organically among neighbors and friends, she said, reaching people who may not have protested last time he was president. we are rallying to demand an end to trumps craven power grab and his acting like the law does not apply to him, said rachel oleary carmona, executive director of womens march, a group that is helping organize the rallies. carmona said she is seeing a broader array of people who want to rally against trump. the rallies that womens march has organized, she said, have focused more on abortion rights and womens issues. the rallies on saturday were more wide-ranging in scope. its hard to get narrow in opposition when his attacks are so broad, carmona said. she said that core progressive groups are growing. womens march, she said, has added 600,000 members just this year. howard bass, 77, a retired smithsonian institution employee, arrived at the rally saturday from arlington, virginia, with a sign listing 11 hands off subjects. among them the smithsonian, academic freedom, greenland, free speech and social security. bass is no stranger to protests. i was out in the streets when nixon was president, bass said. when he heard about the rally, bass said, he decided to come in two seconds, maybe less. bass, a musician who plays the lute and guitar, said about half his income comes from social security. he also draws a pension from his smithsonian employment. he said hes concerned about the future of both. and he worries about his friends still at the smithsonian i know theyre under a lot of pressure, bass said. bass described his central emotion of these days as fear. and he compared his protests against nixon with those against trump. it many ways it was a simpler time, he said of the nixon days. there was one big target vietnam. now there are hundreds of targets to protest against. janice benton, 68, and martin benton, 77, took metro trains from their home in college park, maryland, and headed to the rally in d.c. janice on foot, martin on his mobility scooter. he was born with cerebral palsy and in recent years has developed stenosis of the spine. we cant give up, said martin, wearing a t-shirt that read make orwell fiction again. on the front of the scooter was this sign denying history is anti-american ideology. on the back resist. janice held a sign reading chose empathy not vindictive revenge. people are dying and suffering. martin, a native of monticello, georgia, spent his career a federal employee. he worked at the irs, the library of congress and, lastly, 22 years at the department of education, where he monitored and audited grants used for special education. he worries that cuts or abolishment of the education department will diminish funding and attention to children with disabilities. he was doing what musk is supposed to be doing, janice quipped about her husband of 44 years. shed spent her career in disability advocacy and ministry. janice said she had plans to spend saturday with deaf friends at a retreat an important event that she said gave way to the importance of supporting the hands-off message. she and martin worry about how many people could be affected by cuts to social security, medicare and medicaid. a graduate of the university of georgia law school, and wearing a masters golf cap, martin also worries about law firms giving in to the trump administrations demands. in a speech on thursday, former president barack obama urged law firms, universities and people across the country to stand up for democratic values and resist trump. it is up to all of us to fix this, he said, including the citizen, the ordinary person who says, no, thats not right.

  Title: Pope Francis brought an outsider’s eye to the papacy – even if healing the church’s divisions was beyond him | Catherine Pepinster
  Source: www.theguardian.com (2025-04-21 08:52:52)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article's emphasis on Pope Francis's stances on migrants, LGBTQ issues, and the environment, alongside internal church conflicts, suggests a deliberate framing of his legacy around social progressivism and institutional challenges. Justification: The text dedicates significant space to detailing his views on these specific social issues and the resistance he faced within the church regarding doctrine and reform. Interpretation: This focus potentially shapes public perception by highlighting certain aspects of his papacy while downplaying others, guiding the narrative towards a specific interpretation of his impact and the future direction of the church.; Theories_and_interpretations: The description of Francis's attempts to reform Vatican finances and address the abuse crisis, met with resistance from the 'old guard' and conservatives, can be analyzed through the lens of Organizational Theory, specifically concerning resistance to change within established institutions. Justification: The article explicitly mentions Francis 'sweeping away the old guard' and facing 'dissatisfied rumblings' and 'fiercest opponents' due to his reforms and doctrinal approaches. Interpretation: This illustrates the inherent difficulty in implementing significant structural and cultural changes within a large, historically rooted organization like the Catholic Church, where power dynamics and ideological differences create friction and limit the pace or scope of reform.

letter sent to the countrys roman catholic bishops, he made clear that he completely disagreed with trumps mass deportation plans for illegal migrants. what is built on the basis of force, and not on the truth about the equal dignity of every human being, begins badly and will end badly. the sentiment was not only reserved for trump. throughout his 12 years as pope, francis, who died this morning at the age of 88, focused on the dignity of people, especially those viewed by others as outsiders whether migrants, prisoners, whom he often visited, or lgbtq people. who am i to judge? he famously said when asked about his attitude towards gay men and women, a remark that contrasted starkly with his predecessor, pope benedict xvi, who once described homosexuality as a tendency ordered towards an intrinsic moral evil. this focus on outsiders stemmed in part from franciss own experience. he grew up in argentina, about 7,000 miles from the vatican, and was the child of migrants, whose family arrived in buenos aires in 1929, seeking a new start after scraping a living in rural italy. it was this that caused him to joke to the crowds in romes st peters square, on the night of his election in march 2013, that the cardinals had gone to the peripheries to find a new pope. while these experiences shaped franciss thinking, so did the gospels. he became one of the great communicators of christian faith, chattily expounding like a parish priest to pilgrims attending his general audiences in st peters square. he would finish reciting the angelus prayer there on sundays with a buon pranzo have a good lunch and rarely wore traditional red shoes or white trousers, complaining they made him look like an ice-cream seller. he abandoned the apostolic palace for a simple room in the casa santa marta, a residence used by bishops and cardinals visiting rome. this style forms a major part of his legacy. francis was a pope who wanted none of the pomp of a papacy. but there was substance underlying this, too. his concern for those most affected by economic hardship, war and politics, and the tide of refugees sweeping through europe and america, was matched by his empathy for those uprooted by the climate crisis. his concern for the planet what he called our common home was rooted in a reverence for gods creation. his most radical encyclical, or teaching document, laudato si, was published in 2015, putting forward scientific and theological reasons for protecting the planet from climate breakdown. he would often give his visitors a copy including trump, in 2017. view

were dissatisfied rumblings about his papacy inside the church. when the cardinals gathered in rome to vote for the successor to benedict xvi after his sudden resignation in february 2013, they wanted a reformer who could shake up the management of the churchs finances. francis swept away the old guard of cardinal overseers, and set up his own team of clerics and lay experts, after revelations of mismanagement of the vaticans own finances emerged. he also attempted to change the way the church dealt with priests involved in child sexual abuse. his changes began well, but floundered as details emerged of clerics to whom francis himself seemed to have been too lenient. some of those who supported the argentinian felt frustrated that the church moved too slowly. conservatives in the church were most outraged by franciss approach to morality, particularly his decision to urge parish priests to decide on individual cases as to whether divorced catholics who remarried should receive communion. after this, his fiercest opponents published an unprecedented document a dubia, or expression of doubt, about his teaching. they showed similar disdain for his more recent proposal, published in 2023, that outlined the possibility of blessings for same-sex couples. but liberals were frustrated, too, particularly by his refusal to countenance women becoming priests. true, he appointed several women, albeit almost entirely nuns, to key vatican positions that were previously always occupied by men. that marked huge change, as did his recent synods, which gave lay participants at the synod gatherings the representatives of ordinary catholics in the pews equal discussion and voting rights with bishops and cardinals. now, as the door to the popes room is ritually sealed, and his personal papal ring he has worn for the past 12 years is snapped in two, there will be speculation as to who will follow him. francis will have played his part in shaping the church in his image. of the 138 cardinals eligible to vote in the next conclave to elect a new pope, 110 are franciss personal picks. whoever is elected next, and whatever version of catholicism they preach, the church needs someone who understands how to use the contemporary media to reach out to the world, whether on social media, in a televised interview, or through a letter critiquing the us president. whatever else a pope has to be today, he must be a great communicator. and if the pope has that gift, then he can be not only shepherd of the worlds catholics, but someone who speaks to people of all faiths and none. there were times when francis did appear to have that talent. as to the catholic church itself, given the divisions that constantly threaten to overwhelm it, living up to the old papal title of pontifex bridge is an almost impossible task. catherine pepinster is a former editor of the tablet, the catholic journal

  Title: Vatican power struggle: will an ‘anti-Francis’ pope emerge from conclave? - The Guardian
  Source: news.google.com (2025-04-22 08:00:00)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: This narrative strongly aligns with theories of organizational politics and factionalism within hierarchical structures. The text explicitly details how Pope Francis 'appointed about 110 of those eligible' cardinals, suggesting a deliberate effort to shape the future electorate ('stacked the conclave'). This demonstrates a strategic use of appointments, a common tactic in organizational politics, to consolidate influence and ensure policy continuity beyond a leader's tenure, highlighting that even sacred institutions are subject to secular power dynamics.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article also illustrates the concept of ideological polarization within an institution. It repeatedly contrasts 'conservatives' and 'progressives,' detailing specific points of conflict like the blessing of gay couples, divorced Catholics receiving communion, and clerical celibacy. The mention of figures like Cardinal Müller and Cardinal Burke clashing with Francis, and the description of Benedict as a 'figurehead for conservatives,' provides textual evidence of distinct ideological camps actively opposing each other, framing the succession not just as a leadership change but a battle for the institution's doctrinal and social direction.; Intriguing_angles: The article notes that Cardinal Raymond Burke 'aligns with the views of donald trump' and that 'trump, china, nationalists these are variables that will somehow count' in the conclave. The textual basis is the explicit mention of Trump and other geopolitical concepts as factors influencing the internal church process. Why are external political figures and nationalist concepts presented as relevant variables in a papal election? Could this suggest a deeper entanglement between internal church politics and global political currents than is explicitly detailed, or perhaps a perception among observers that external political alignments influence the cardinals' choices?

  Content: of 135 cardinals eligible to take part in choosing successor, late pontiff appointed about 110 including conservatives the death of pope francis will throw into sharp relief the internecine power struggle that has been a hallmark of his papacy. in the coming days, a ferocious battle for the future of the church will be played out with the highest of stakes within the sanctity of the sistine chapel. there are more than 250 cardinals in total, but those over the age of 80 are ineligible to take part in the conclave. that leaves 135 eligible cardinals, who will begin making their way to rome in the coming days. in the 12 years after francis became pope, he appointed about 110 of those eligible, casting his net wide across the globe. some vatican observers have suggested he stacked the conclave in favour of a successor likely to embrace his outlook and continue his work. the appointments make it difficult for an anti-francis pope to emerge, said iacopo scaramuzzi, a vatican journalist with la repubblica newspaper and author of the book tango vaticano. la chiesa al tempo di francesco vatican tango. the church in the time of francis. but it doesnt mean this group is unanimous and cohesive, or that they have the same ideas. almost all the cardinals he has chosen are pastors from great dioceses around the world. there were conservatives as well as progressives among them, scaramuzzi added. for example, gerhard ludwig müller, a german cardinal francis appointed, clashed with the late pope on numerous issues, including blasting the decree to allow the blessing of gay couples as heresy. from the moment he was elected, francis infuriated conservatives and traditionalists with a new style of papacy, a message of compassion and tolerance, and a challenge to centuries of privilege at the helm of the roman catholic church. in his public pronouncements, he championed the poor and marginalised, criticised the impact of global capitalism on peoples lives, demanded action on the climate crisis, urged mercy for sinners, and called for compassion towards migrants and refugees. in the vatican itself, francis cut a very different figure. where previous popes had favoured red leather slippers and ermine-trimmed capes, he preferred stout shoes and a plain white cassock. while his predecessors had resided in the lavish papal apartment waited on by devoted nuns, francis chose to live in the simple santa marta guesthouse and eat in a self-service cafeteria. for much of franciss papacy, the figurehead for conservatives who opposed him was none other than his immediate predecessor. benedict had promised to remain hidden from the world after vacating the papal throne in 2013 the first pope to resign in 600 years but had stayed at the vatican, holding meetings, giving interviews and writing books and articles and expressing views sharply at odds with those of francis. but the staunch opposition to francis did not fade after benedicts death on new years eve in 2022, or after the death just 10 days later of the influential cardinal george pell, who described francis papacy as a catastrophe in a memo published under a false name. francis occasionally made stinging references to his enemies. in his autobiography, hope, which published in january, he noted that a clue to the state of mind of his critics was evident in the ostentatious way they dressed. these ways of dressing up sometimes conceal mental imbalance, emotional deviation, behavioural difficulties, a personal problem that may be exploited, francis wrote. conservatives were infuriated by his softening of the churchs stance on divorced and remarried catholics, opening the door to some of them receiving communion. enraging those who adhered to the doctrine that divorce is a sin, the move prompted a group of conservative clerics to accuse francis of heresy for that too. the heresy charge was repeated in a 20-page open letter in 2019, signed by prominent priests and scholars in response to the accumulating harm caused by pope franciss words and actions over several years, which have given rise to one of the worst crises in the history of the catholic church. foremost among his critics was the us cardinal raymond burke, who has long pushed back against the popes stance on gay rights and social justice issues and who, like müller, aligns with the views of donald trump. francis marginalised burke, even stripping him of his salary and vatican-subsidised apartment. but burke is still popular among conservative catholic americans. cardinal robert sarah emerged as another arch-rival in january 2020 when he published a book, apparently co-authored with benedict, which defended clerical celibacy at the moment when francis was considering a relaxation of the rules. the guinean cardinal has also railed against islam, migrants, gay people and the role of women. several variables will influence the outcome of the conclave, especially world politics. trump, china, nationalists these are variables that will somehow count, said scaramuzzi. also, maybe there is a desire for someone more orderly, and less charismatic than francis. several things can carry weight at the time of the vote, which can either move towards a more progressive or conservative choice.

Historical Article 20 (ID: 130369):
  Title: Pope’s frequent calls to a Catholic church made him a revered figure in war-battered Gaza
  Source: apnews.com (2025-04-22 16:36:55)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article highlights the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, where Pope Francis's calls for a ceasefire went "unheeded." This aligns with Realism, which posits that states (or in this case, powerful non-state actors) prioritize their own security and interests above moral appeals. The text states, "israels airstrikes killed at least 14 people," and mentions the initial attack by "hamas-led militants," illustrating the self-help system where each side resorts to violence to achieve its objectives. This suggests that moral suasion alone is insufficient to overcome deeply entrenched security dilemmas.; Theories_and_interpretations: Agenda-Setting Theory: The article showcases how Pope Francis used his platform to draw attention to the suffering in Gaza, repeatedly calling for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid. The text mentions his "frequent evening ritual" of calling the church in Gaza and his public statements condemning the "machine-gunning of children." This demonstrates agenda-setting, where the Pope attempted to influence public perception and policy by emphasizing specific aspects of the conflict. This suggests that even without direct political power, influential figures can shape the narrative and potentially influence policy decisions by highlighting certain issues.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions that "in israel, the pope left a more complicated legacy" and that he was "widely appreciated for his outreach to the jewish people and tough stance against antisemitism" but also "increasingly outspoken in his criticism of the israeli militarys harsh tactics." This suggests a potential tension between different factions within Israeli society regarding the Pope's stance. What specific aspects of the Pope's criticism were most controversial, and how did these criticisms affect his overall relationship with the Israeli government and public?; Intriguing_angles: The article states that "senior hamas official basem naim said francis was a steadfast advocate for the legitimate rights of the palestinian people, particularly in his unwavering stance against the war and acts of genocide perpetrated against our people in gaza in recent months." This statement frames the Pope's actions as supportive of Palestinian rights and against genocide, a highly charged term. Could this framing by Hamas be an attempt to legitimize their own actions or gain international sympathy, and how might this influence perceptions of the conflict?

  Content: deir al-balah, gaza strip ap in the last 18 months of his life, pope francis had a frequent evening ritual he would call the lone catholic church in the gaza strip to see how people huddled inside were coping with a devastating war. that small act of compassion made a big impression on gazas tiny christian community and was why he was remembered at his death monday as a beloved father figure in the beleaguered territory. i was deeply saddened. he was our biggest supporter after god, said suheil abu dawoud, a 19-year-old christian in gaza. francis always healed our wounds and asked us to be strong, he said. he was always praying for us. in his last public appearance, francis called for a ceasefire between israel and the hamas militant group. a fervent advocate of interfaith relations, he also urged hamas to release the dozens of israeli hostages it is holding and condemned growing global antisemitism. in his easter message, francis expressed his closeness to the sufferings of christians in palestine and israel and to all the israeli people and the palestinian people. while noting the growing antisemitism, he added i think of the people of gaza and its christian community in particular, where the terrible conflict continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation. the war in gaza began when hamas-led militants attacked southern israel on oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. some 59 hostages remain in captivity, 24 of them believed to be alive. israels offensive has reduced much of gaza to rubble and killed over 51,000 palestinians, mostly women and children, according to gazas health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. most of gazas 2.3 million people remain homeless. things have worsened over the past month since israel ended a ceasefire and imposed a closure blocking all humanitarian aid into gaza. aid officials say thousands of children have beome malnourished and most people have little more than one meal a day. i appeal to the warring parties call on a ceasefire, release the hostages and come to the aid of starving people that aspires to a future of peace! francis said in his final address. that appeal also went unheeded. on monday, israels airstrikes killed at least 14 people, according to medical officials. in israel, the pope left a more complicated legacy. he was widely appreciated for his outreach to the jewish people and tough stance against antisemitism. he also was an advocate for freeing the hostages, meeting with their families during the war. israeli president isaac herzog remembered francis as a man of deep faith and boundless compassion. i truly hope that his prayers for peace in the middle east and for the safe return of the hostages will soon be answered, herzog wrote on social media. in the past year and a half of war, francis became increasingly outspoken in his criticism of the israeli militarys harsh tactics. a month into the war, he urged an investigation into whether israels war amounted to genocide - a charge israel vehemently denies. in december, francis expressed his pain thinking of gaza, of such cruelty, to the machine-gunning of children, to the bombing of schools and hospitals. . how much cruelty! the next month, he called the ongoing humanitarian crisis very serious and shameful. francis was mourned throughout the arab world and by u.n. officials, including philippe lazzarini, head of the agency for palestinian refugees, unrwa. he posted on x that the popes voice has contributed to draw the attention to significant dehumanization of the war in gaza beyond. senior hamas official basem naim said francis was a steadfast advocate for the legitimate rights of the palestinian people, particularly in his unwavering stance against the war and acts of genocide perpetrated against our people in gaza in recent months. the holy lands christian community has dwindled over the decades through emigration and a low birthrate and makes up just a small percentage of the overall population. only 1,000 christians live in gaza, an overwhelmingly muslim territory, according to the u.s. state departments international religious freedom report for 2024. the report says the majority of palestinian christians are greek orthodox but they also include other christians, including roman catholics. last year, francis told cbs 60 minutes that he calls a priest daily at 7 p.m. at the holy family church, the only catholic church in gaza, to hear what is happening to the nearly 600 people sheltering at the facility. the other day, they were happy because they managed to eat some meat. the rest of the time they eat flour, things made of flour, francis told the program. sometimes they go hungry and they tell me things. there is a lot of suffering. its very tough. very tough. the food arrives, people rush to get it, he said. the rev. gabriele romanelli, a church official, said francis last call came saturday. suhair anastas, a palestinian woman who was part of a group that met francis in 2023 after she fled gaza, said she felt great sadness over his death. anastas, who is greek orthodox, had sheltered at the church compound in gaza before she left. he did stand by us, by letting us stay at the church and by taking care of everyone in the church, she said. i know he wasnt able to stop the genocide . but i dont know who can. when she met the pope, anastas had mixed emotions. the experience was breathtaking, she said, but she added she also felt traumatized, sad and guilty that youre meeting him and others are still under bombardment. she said she will remember the pope for standing with us to a certain extent, but i wish he could have done more. george antoun, an official at the church, told the associated press the popes interest gave the community hope and inspiration. francis was like a father worried for his children and would ask whether there was food, medical care and medicine, he said. he was with us step by step and day by day, antoun said. dont be afraid. i am with you and praying for you and i will protect you, antoun quoted francis as saying. he left a big inheritance in gaza. he is the saint of gaza. ___ mroue reported from beirut. associated press writer mariam fam in cairo contributed to this report.
