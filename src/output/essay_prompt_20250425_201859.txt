  Title: Is Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated (CORT) Among the Best Guru Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts?
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-23 17:17:07)
  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. we recently published a list of 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. in this article, we are going to take a look at where corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort stands against other guru stocks to invest in. wall street seems to be breathing a little easier after the initial panic over president trumps tariffs earlier this month, but the rollercoaster is not over just yet. all three major indexes closed last week in the red, with the dow and nasdaq both dipping over 2, and the broader market down more than 1. even though markets remain closed on april 18 for good friday, the general consensus is that the worst of the trade war headlines might be dying down. marko papic, chief strategist of geomacro strategy at bca research, remains cautiously optimistic, noting that while the idea of president trump striking 90 trade deals in 90 days sounds ambitious, they will likely be small, symbolic wins that still help calm markets. that said, volatility is expected to continue, and papic predicts the broader market could dip again before bouncing back, potentially giving investors a buying opportunity. investors are deep in earnings season right now, and some of wall streets biggest banks have reported solid first-quarter results. a big part of their success came from their trading desks, which cashed in on the recent market volatility, especially in equities. however, despite strong numbers on paper, bank ceos remain cautious and are hesitant to make big moves right now because of the market uncertainty. the us dollar also just had its worst weekly performance since 2022. meanwhile, investors are playing it safe and rapidly buying bonds, which pushed the 10-year treasury yield down to around 4.28. while some investors are seeing the current market dip as a buying opportunity, daniel von ahlen from globaldata ts lombard says otherwise. he believes the risks of a recession are being seriously underestimated. even though trumps recent tariff halt gave markets a bit of a boost, ahlen thinks that bounce will not last. in his view, this is not the time to scoop up stocks on the cheap, he is actually advising people to sell into rallies and avoid the usual buy-the-dip strategy. ahlen suggests getting a bit more cautious and selective. instead of jumping into the whole market, he recommends focusing on defensive sectors, like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare, that tend to hold up better in downturns. the market uncertainty is reflected in etfs as well, which are often considered wiser investment options due to active management strategies and lower risk compared to individual investing. for example, the guru etf is down 8.30 year-to-date as of april 18. however, over the last 12 months, the fund has posted share price returns of 13.38. similarly, five-year share returns stand at an impressive 51.57. guru gives retail investors a way to tap into the top stock picks of major hedge funds at a relatively low 0.75 expense ratio. it offers a more affordable and flexible way to try and beat the broader market using expert insights. so, lets take a look at the best guru stocks to buy. a biologist in a lab coat studying a culture of cells to find a cure for metabolic disorders. for this article, we looked up the guru etf, which had 82 holdings as of april 18. next, we manually searched for the average upside potential of each stock and selected 11 stocks with the highest values. the list below is ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of april 18. we have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment as of q4 2024. why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? the reason is simple our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. our quarterly newsletters strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4 since may 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points see more details here. number of hedge fund holders 29 average upside potential 117.48 corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort is an american biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for endocrine, oncologic, metabolic, and neurological conditions. their approved drug, korlym, helps manage high blood sugar in adults with cushings syndrome. cort is one of the best guru stocks to invest in, with an average upside potential of 117 as of april 18. on april 3, piper sandler raised the price target on corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort from 128 to 131 and maintained an overweight rating on the stock after strong phase iii results for relacorilant in treating platinum-resistant ovarian cancer proc. piper sandler sees proc as a billion-dollar market that could play a big role in corcepts future growth. the company plans to file for us approval in q3 2025, followed by a submission in the eu. corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort set records for both new korlym prescribers and patients in the fourth quarter of 2024. as awareness of hypercortisolism grows and more people are being screened, the company expects continued growth in its cushings syndrome business. revenue for the quarter reached 181.9 million, up from 135.4 million in q4 2023. total revenue for the year came in at 675 million, compared to 482.4 million last year. net income for the quarter was slightly lower at 30.7 million, but full-year net income increased to 141.2 million. corcept ended the year with 603.2 million in cash and investments and used 38 million for stock buybacks and employee stock options. according to insider monkeys q4 data, 29 hedge funds held long positions in corcept therapeutics incorporated nasdaqcort, up from 20 funds in the last quarter. jim simons renaissance technologies was the leading position holder in the company, with nearly 6.2 million shares worth 312.3 million. overall, cort ranks 5th among the 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. while we acknowledge the potential of cort as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that ai stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. there is an ai stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular ai stocks lost around 25. if you are looking for an ai stock that is more promising than cort but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest ai stock. read next 20 best ai stocks to buy now and 30 best stocks to buy now according to billionaires. disclosure none. this article is originally published at insider monkey.

  Title: Coca-Cola under fire after bombshell report exposes ties to controversial industry: 'The cost is irreversible damage to our children's health'
  Source: www.yahoo.com (2025-04-22 11:30:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying the concept of Externalities, the article highlights how the social costs of fracking and plastic production (environmental damage, health issues) are not fully borne by the companies involved (Coca-Cola, Unilever, etc.). The text states, 'the fracking process creates environmental damage and can significantly impact local communities' and mentions 'irreversible damage to our childrens health'. This suggests a market failure where the price of plastic does not reflect its true cost to society, leading to overproduction and consumption.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Coca-Cola's 'World Without Waste' initiative but then states 'its link to fracking operations suggests it is still looking to create new plastics.' This juxtaposition creates a contradiction. What are the specific mechanisms preventing Coca-Cola from fully transitioning to recycled plastics, and could these mechanisms be related to the profitability of fracking-derived plastics?

  Title: Abu Dhabi Continues Building Big In Culture Push
  Source: finance.yahoo.com (2025-04-21 15:11:34)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Political Economy theory, the article demonstrates how direct political intervention, specifically President Trump's threats against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and pressure to cut rates, is presented as a primary driver of market instability. The text states the US dollar and treasuries are 'under pressure' and 'selling off' due to 'fallout from president trumps threats' and that risks to 'fed independence' put 'downward pressure on the confidence that foreign investors have'. This aligns with political economy perspectives where political actors' actions, even those targeting independent institutions, have immediate and tangible economic consequences, disrupting market confidence and asset values.; Theories_and_interpretations: The article heavily utilizes Agenda-Setting Theory by focusing on specific, curated topics and expert opinions presented as central to market movements. Phrases like 'stories driving the market action', 'stocks in focus this week', and repeated references to 'Jim Cramer's game plan' or lists like '12 AI stocks on wall streets radar' highlight how financial media and analysts select and emphasize certain narratives (political pressure on the Fed, specific tech stock performance, curated investment lists) to shape the perceived market agenda for investors. This suggests the article's structure is designed to direct reader attention to these specific points, potentially influencing their investment focus.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions 'uncertainty surrounding federal policy' contributing to businesses being 'priced for a significant slowdown... if not a recession'. However, it also notes that hopes for the 'new administrations pro-business approach swiftly gave way to tariff fears'. Textual Basis: These points appear in the paragraphs referencing investment letters from Heartland Advisors and Ariel Investments. Significance: The text presents both 'uncertainty' from federal policy and a 'pro-business approach' as factors, but then immediately links the 'pro-business approach' to 'tariff fears' that caused investors to 'fled to shelter'. This juxtaposition is intriguing because it suggests that the *specific nature* of the 'pro-business' policies (tariffs) was the source of the uncertainty and negative market reaction, potentially complicating or even contradicting a simple 'pro-business' label. Probing Question: How does the article reconcile the idea of a 'pro-business approach' with the simultaneous rise of 'tariff fears' and 'uncertainty surrounding federal policy' leading to recession pricing? Does the text imply certain 'pro-business' policies are inherently destabilizing for markets?

the reason is simple our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. our quarterly newsletters strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4 since may 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points see more details here. fisher asset management equity stake 2.88 billion forward pe ratio as of april 17 14.37 number of hedge holders 81 chevron corporation nysecvx is an integrated energy company that provides crude oil, natural gas, and refined products. it also develops and markets lubricants, fuel oil additives, and chemicals. it is one of the energy plays holding steady amid the turmoil in the sector, on oil prices plunging below the 70-a-barrel level. on april 15, wells fargo reiterated a buy rating on the stock with a 173 price target buoyed by the companys strategic moves. while chevron corporation nysecvx is facing increased depreciation and amortization in its upstream sector and adjustments in production volumes, analysts believe the 2.3 billion acquisition of hess stakes will act as a favorable tailwind. in the long run, chevron intends to acquire all of hesss outstanding shares to strengthen its shale footprint further. the acquisition should diversify the companys portfolio by gaining access to an asset with industry-leading cash margins and low carbon intensity. chevron corporation nysecvx is expected to deliver non-gaap eps of 10.30 in fy25, up 2.5 from 10.05 in fiscal 2024. earnings are expected to surge by 18.7 in fiscal 2026 to 12.23 per share, affirming underlying growth even as it faces headwinds amid the turmoil in the energy sector. overall, cvx ranks 5th on our list of value stocks in ken fishers portfolio. while we acknowledge the potential of cvx as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that ai stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. there is an ai stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular ai stocks lost around 25. if you are looking for an ai stock that is more promising than cvx but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings check out our report about this cheapest ai stock. read next 20 best ai stocks to buy now and 30 best stocks to buy now according to billionaires. disclosure none. this article is originally published at insider monkey.

  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. we recently published a list of 10 best low volatility stocks to buy now. in this article, we are going to take a look at where eli lilly and company nyselly stands against other best low volatility stocks to buy now. the us stock market experienced a turbulent first quarter of 2025, marked by increased volatility and negative returns across the major indices. uncertainty surrounding the performance of technology stocks, economic data, and trade tensions caused market volatility. the year began with the revelation of an artificial intelligence ai software developed in china called deepseek. the innovative ai rivalled its us competitors, such as chatgpt, and was considered revolutionary compared to others, sending shockwaves across the global markets. reuters reported a global investor sell-off across us indexes, with one of the major tech companies alone losing 593 million in one day. the us government was quick to implement policies aimed at promoting us-listed tech firms, while simultaneously reducing the impact of deepseek ai, such as the use of tariffs against trade with chinese firms. in february of 2025, the us governments first round of tariffs was aimed directly at china in an effort to curb the impact of deepseek on the united states tech industry. in march, president trump announced a rate of 54 tariff on chinese goods, while china retaliated with 34 tariffs on us goods and services. as reported by cnbc, the total tariffs applied on chinese goods by the united states stand at 145, as of april 11, 2025, with exemptions on specific sectors such as technology, automobiles smart phones. china implemented retaliatory trade tariffs of 125 on american goods and services. due to this economic landscape, the uncertainty surrounding interest rates added to market volatility. the federal reserve announced it would maintain interest rates between 4.25 and 4.50. speaking at a dinner at the economic club of chicago, federal reserve chairman jerome powell stated for the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance. the us economy is considered to be entering continuous stagflation, which is defined as continued inflation with very low growth and high unemployment. the cboe volatility index aka vix is one of the indicators that the fed monitors as part of the broader tools available to assess market conditions. a vix of 20 or higher suggests a higher-than-normal level of expected price fluctuations. the vix is currently at 32.64. the current market suggests that investors might want to lean toward low-risk stocks to avoid potential financial pitfalls. low-volatility stocks are currently outpacing the broader market and proving their strength during uncertain times. after two lackluster years, this strategy has emerged as the top-performing investment theme of 2025 among the 13 tracked by bloomberg intelligence. joe gilbert, portfolio manager at integrity asset management, made the following comment about the low risk stocks investors are going to have to live with volatility at least for the remainder of this year. the lower volatility names are the place for investors to hide. in this article, we researched the 20 companies with the lowest 5-year beta monthly between 0.2 and 0.8, using the yahoo finance stocks screener. next, we used insider monkeys q4 2024 proprietary hedge fund holdings database and identified the 10 most popular hedge fund stocks. the stocks are ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund positions. at insider monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? the reason is simple our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. our quarterly newsletters strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4 since may 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points see more details here. 5-year monthly beta 0.5 no. of hedge fund holders 115 eli lilly and company nyselly is a global pharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and marketing human pharmaceuticals. the company offers a wide range of treatments across several therapeutic areas, with a portfolio that includes various insulin formulations under the humalog and humulin brands, as well as newer medications like jardiance, mounjaro, trulicity, and zepbound for obesity and type 2 diabetes. while pharmaceuticals have often been exempted from direct tariffs, the broader implications of a trade war and potential future tariffs specifically targeting the sector are expected to impact lly. eli lilly and company nyselly actively collaborates with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including incyte, boehringer ingelheim, roche, and others, to advance its research and development efforts across its diverse therapeutic pipeline. the company markets its products in the united states, europe, china, japan, and other international markets. to offset the impact of new tariffs on margins, the pharmaceutical giant continues to deliver high-quality medicine to patients globally by setting up local manufacturing to offset fears of supply chain constraints. eli lilly and company nyselly has made eight acquisitions and signed three agreements over the past 27 months, as per the companys press releases. these begin from dice therapeutics in june of 2023 to the most recent scorpion therapeutics in january 2025. these strategic acquisitions are key to achieving continued growth into new markets. eli lilly and company nyselly stock price surged recently, following the successful completion of a phase 3 trial for orforglipron, its once-daily oral glp-1 medication. the drug effectively met both the primary and key secondary endpoints in patients with type 2 diabetes. this positive outcome has significantly increased investor optimism regarding lillys competitive position within the rapidly expanding obesity drug market. overall, lly ranks 4th on our list of best low volatility stocks to buy now. while we acknowledge the potential of lly, our conviction lies in the belief that ai stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. there is an ai stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular ai stocks lost around 25. if you are looking for an ai stock that is more promising than lly but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest ai stock. read next 20 best ai stocks to buy now and 30 best stocks to buy now according to billionaires. disclosure none. this article is originally published at insider monkey.

  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. we recently published a list of 10 dirt cheap stocks to invest in now. in this article, we are going to take a look at where merck co., inc. nysemrk stands against other dirt cheap stocks to invest in now. the stock market has been experiencing volatility and has quickly shifted from the post-election highs to being priced for recession. as of april 8, the sp 500 had declined 19 from the all-time highs. the magnitude of this fall is slightly shy of the bear market threshold, thereby creating a sense of confusion for the investors to pave their way forward. to talk about the investment strategy during times of volatility, prime capital financial cio will mcgough joined yahoo finance on april 11 for an interview. mcgough noted that they have been telling their clients and advisors to prepare for the volatility before the start of 2025. this is partly due to the new regime in washington dc and its policies. however, more importantly, the market has had two really great years with more than 20 gains back to back, as a result, the price-to-earnings ratios were extended to historical extremes and earnings growth was delivering around 15 to 20. these figures suggested that the market was almost at its peak with very little upside potential left to explore, which pointed towards risks of volatility. mcgough presented his investment strategy during this time of volatility. he highlighted that they have been advising investors to look for diversity and increased exposure, which essentially means to be cognizant of the exposure your portfolio has in terms of growth and value stocks. he noted that if you have the mag seven in your portfolio, they are concentrated and are categorized as large-cap growth, which suggests that the portfolio should be balanced with value and dividend-paying stocks as well. mcgough noted that this helps temper the volatility and provides some stability. he also highlighted that after 15 years the market is finally moving away from the mag seven and in this scenario, the investors simply need to look for market weight stocks rather than overweight. another area for investors to look at is the international market. mcgough pointed out that for a greater chunk of recent history, the united states market has dominated international stocks, however, the current market tightening and trump administration policies are encouraging international stocks to increase spending and promote revenue growth. therefore this can be a good time for investors to look ahead of the united states market into international stocks such as those based in europe and germany. mcgough concluded that all of the market situation points towards a single mantra of being diversified rather than placing all the eggs in a single basket. to compile the list of 10 dirt cheap stocks to invest in now, we used the finviz stock screener, seeking alpha, and yahoo finance. using the screener we first aggregated a list of stocks trading below the forward pe of less than 10 with earnings expected to grow during the year. after sorting the list by market capitalization, we cross-checked each stocks pe and earnings growth from seeking alpha and yahoo finance, respectively. lastly, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders, sourced from insider monkeys database. why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? the reason is simple our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. our quarterly newsletters strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4 since may 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points see more details here. a close-up of a persons hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals. forward pe ratio 8.84 earnings growth this year 17.09 number of hedge fund holders 91 merck co., inc. nysemrk is another international pharmaceutical company that operates through two main segments namely pharmaceuticals and animal health. on april 8th, goldman sachs analyst asad haider maintained a buy rating on the stock. the analyst noted that the market is overly pessimistic about merck co., inc. nysemrk and its product pipeline value. he noted that the animal health segment of the company generates substantial revenue while showing growth potential. haider believes that the segment is also highly undervalued by the market. in addition, keytruda is one of the key drugs by the company. the sales for keytruda in 2024 reached 29.5 billion, reflecting an 18 increase year-over-year. moreover, the overall global sales improved by 7 year-over-year during the fourth quarter alone to reach 15.6 billion. merck co., inc. nysemrk is one of the dirt-cheap stocks to invest in now. overall, mrk ranks 3rd on our list of dirt cheap stocks to invest in now. while we acknowledge the potential of mrk to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that ai stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. there is an ai stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular ai stocks lost around 25. if you are looking for an ai stock that is more promising than mrk but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest ai stock. read next 20 best ai stocks to buy now and 30 best stocks to buy now according to billionaires. disclosure none. this article is originally published at insider monkey.

  Title: Jim Cramer Says The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) May Blow Numbers Away
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-21 14:27:56)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory, the article's heavy reliance on Jim Cramer's commentary ('jim cramers game plan', 'cramer emphasized', 'cramer commented') serves to elevate his specific views on market events, economic policy, and individual stocks to prominence. This suggests the article is actively shaping the reader's focus, highlighting what is deemed important within the financial discourse presented, rather than offering a neutral overview of all relevant factors.; Theories_and_interpretations: The mention that 'the president wants lower interest rates to help offset the pain from higher prices that gonna be caused by the tariffs' aligns with the Political Business Cycle Theory. This indicates a potential political motivation behind the executive branch's desire to influence monetary policy, specifically to mitigate negative economic consequences (higher prices from tariffs) stemming from other policies enacted by the administration, suggesting political considerations may be impacting economic policy preferences.; Intriguing_angles: Cramer's statement about Jerome Powell, 'history says he should be doing exactly what hes doing, but history is now in the eye of the beholder and theres only one beholder in this whole country and it aint jay powell,' is particularly noteworthy. While presented within market commentary, this cryptic remark, appearing after discussing Powell's difficult position and political noise, strongly implies a single, non-Fed entity holds significant, perhaps undue, influence over the economic narrative or reality. Who is this 'one beholder,' and what does this suggest about the true independence of the Federal Reserve or the nature of economic power dynamics in the current environment?; Intriguing_angles: The article transitions from discussing broad economic themes and established companies based on Cramer's views to a strong promotional push for 'AI stocks,' claiming they 'hold greater promise' and directing readers to a report on the 'cheapest AI stock.' This shift, particularly the contrast drawn with Procter Gamble and the explicit call to action for AI stock content, suggests the article may serve a dual purpose: reporting on Cramer's analysis while simultaneously leveraging that context to promote the publisher's specific investment recommendations, potentially framing AI stocks as a uniquely superior opportunity regardless of the broader market discussion.

  Title: Jim Cramer Flags PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) for Pricing Concerns on Chips
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-21 14:28:02)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Applying Keynesian economics, the article highlights the tension between presidential desires for lower interest rates to stimulate the economy ('the president wants lower interest rates to help offset the pain from higher prices that gonna be caused by the tariffs') and the Federal Reserve's concern about inflation ('the federal reserve never cuts rates when inflations out of control'). This reflects the Keynesian emphasis on government intervention to manage aggregate demand, contrasted with concerns about inflationary pressures that such intervention can create. The article suggests a potential conflict between short-term economic stimulus and long-term price stability.; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Cramer's growing weariness of 'the political noise surrounding monetary policy,' yet also quotes him extensively on the Fed's actions and the President's desires. This creates a subtle tension: is Cramer truly distancing himself from political commentary, or is he subtly shaping the narrative through his analysis? What specific 'political noise' is he referring to, and how might that noise be influencing market perceptions of monetary policy?

  Title: Is Chevron Corporation (CVX) the Cheap Blue Chip Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-22 15:03:14)
  Narrative Frames: Theories_and_interpretations: Realism: The article highlights the impact of US policy uncertainty (tariff hikes, deregulation, immigration policies) on financial markets. This aligns with Realism's emphasis on the state's role in shaping the international environment and the pursuit of national interests, which in this case, manifests as economic policies affecting global markets. The article states, 'the broad-based market anxiety increased as the us policy uncertainty rose.' This suggests that actions taken by the US government, driven by its own perceived interests, directly influence global economic stability and investor confidence.; Intriguing_angles: The article promotes Chevron as a potentially good investment, but then pivots to suggest AI stocks are better. The text states, 'while we acknowledge the potential of cvx as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued ai stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns.' This sudden shift raises questions about the article's true purpose. Is it genuinely evaluating Chevron, or is it primarily a vehicle to promote AI stocks? What are the undisclosed incentives for promoting AI stocks over traditional energy investments?; Intriguing_angles: The article mentions Fidelity's assessment of US economic dynamics as 'mid- and late-cycle' in Q1 2025, alongside concerns about 'growth risks.' This assessment, while seemingly objective, could be interpreted as a subtle warning about a potential economic slowdown. What specific indicators led Fidelity to this conclusion, and what are the potential implications for investors if a recession occurs sooner than anticipated?

  Title: The World's Biggest Companies Have Caused $28 Trillion in Climate Damage, a New Study Estimates
  Source: www.usnews.com (2025-04-23 15:12:29)
  Content: washington ap the worlds biggest corporations have caused 28 trillion in climate damage, a new study estimates as part of an effort to make it easier for people and governments to hold companies financially accountable, like the tobacco giants have been. a dartmouth college research team came up with the estimated pollution caused by 111 companies, with more than half of the total dollar figure coming from 10 fossil fuel providers saudi aramco, gazprom, chevron, exxonmobil, bp, shell, national iranian oil co., pemex, coal india and the british coal corporation. for comparison, 28 trillion is a shade less than the sum of all goods and services produced in the united states last year. at the top of the list, saudi aramco and gazprom have each caused a bit more than 2 trillion in heat damage over the decades, the team calculated in a study published in wednesdays journal nature. the researchers figured that every 1 of greenhouse gas put into the atmosphere since 1990 has caused 502 billion in damage from heat alone, which doesnt include the costs incurred by other extreme weather such as hurricanes, droughts and floods. people talk about making polluters pay, and sometimes even take them to court or pass laws meant to rein them in. the study is an attempt to determine the causal linkages that underlie many of these theories of accountability, said its lead author, christopher callahan, who did the work at dartmouth but is now an earth systems scientist at stanford university. the research firm zero carbon analytics counts 68 lawsuits filed globally about climate change damage, with more than half of them in the united states. everybodys asking the same question what can we actually claim about who has caused this? said dartmouth climate scientist justin mankin, co-author of the study. and that really comes down to a thermodynamic question of can we trace climate hazards andor their damages back to particular emitters? the answer is yes, callahan and mankin said. the researchers started with known final emissions of the products such as gasoline or electricity from coal-fired power plants produced by the 111 biggest carbon-oriented companies going as far back as 137 years, because thats as far back as any of the companies emissions data go and carbon dioxide stays in the air for much longer than that. they used 1,000 different computer simulations to translate those emissions into changes for earths global average surface temperature by comparing it to a world without that companys emissions. using this approach, they determined that pollution from chevron, for example, has raised the earths temperature by .045 degrees fahrenheit .025 degrees celsius. the researchers also calculated how much each companys pollution contributed to the five hottest days of the year using 80 more computer simulations and then applying a formula that connects extreme heat intensity to changes in economic output. this system is modeled on the established techniques scientists have been using for more than a decade to attribute extreme weather events, such as the 2021 pacific northwest heat wave, to climate change. mankin said that in the past, there was an argument of, whos to say that its my molecule of co2 thats contributed to these damages versus any other one? he said his study really laid clear how the veil of plausible deniability doesnt exist anymore scientifically. we can actually trace harms back to major emitters. shell declined to comment. aramco, gazprom, chevron, exxon mobil and bp did not respond to requests for comment. all methods they use are quite robust, said imperial college london climate scientist friederike otto, who heads world weather attribution, a collection of scientists who try rapid attribution studies to see if specific extreme weather events are worsened by climate change and, if so, by how much. she didnt take part in the study. it would be good in my view if this approach would be taken up more by different groups. as with event attribution, the more groups do it, the better the science gets and the better we know what makes a difference and what does not, otto said. so far, no climate liability lawsuit against a major carbon emitter has been successful, but maybe showing how overwhelmingly strong the scientific evidence is can change that, she said. in the past, damage caused by individual companies were lost in the noise of data, so it couldnt be calculated, callahan said. we have now reached a point in the climate crisis where the total damages are so immense that the contributions of a single companys product can amount to tens of billions of dollars a year, said chris field, a stanford university climate scientist who didnt take part in the research. this is a good exercise and proof of concept, but there are so many other climate variables that the numbers that callahan and mankin came up with are probably a vast underestimate of the damage the companies have really caused, said michael mann, a university of pennsylvania climate scientist who wasnt involved in the study. ___ follow seth borenstein on x at borenbears. the associated press climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. ap is solely responsible for all content. find aps standards for working with philanthropies, a list of supporters and funded coverage areas at ap.org. 2025 the associated press. . this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

  Title: Is MoonLake Immunotherapeutics (MLTX) Among the Best Guru Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts?
  Source: biztoc.com (2025-04-23 17:17:02)
  Content: unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers wall street. we recently published a list of 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. in this article, we are going to take a look at where moonlake immunotherapeutics nasdaqmltx stands against other guru stocks to invest in. wall street seems to be breathing a little easier after the initial panic over president trumps tariffs earlier this month, but the rollercoaster is not over just yet. all three major indexes closed last week in the red, with the dow and nasdaq both dipping over 2, and the broader market down more than 1. even though markets remain closed on april 18 for good friday, the general consensus is that the worst of the trade war headlines might be dying down. marko papic, chief strategist of geomacro strategy at bca research, remains cautiously optimistic, noting that while the idea of president trump striking 90 trade deals in 90 days sounds ambitious, they will likely be small, symbolic wins that still help calm markets. that said, volatility is expected to continue, and papic predicts the broader market could dip again before bouncing back, potentially giving investors a buying opportunity. investors are deep in earnings season right now, and some of wall streets biggest banks have reported solid first-quarter results. a big part of their success came from their trading desks, which cashed in on the recent market volatility, especially in equities. however, despite strong numbers on paper, bank ceos remain cautious and are hesitant to make big moves right now because of the market uncertainty. the us dollar also just had its worst weekly performance since 2022. meanwhile, investors are playing it safe and rapidly buying bonds, which pushed the 10-year treasury yield down to around 4.28. while some investors are seeing the current market dip as a buying opportunity, daniel von ahlen from globaldata ts lombard says otherwise. he believes the risks of a recession are being seriously underestimated. even though trumps recent tariff halt gave markets a bit of a boost, ahlen thinks that bounce will not last. in his view, this is not the time to scoop up stocks on the cheap, he is actually advising people to sell into rallies and avoid the usual buy-the-dip strategy. ahlen suggests getting a bit more cautious and selective. instead of jumping into the whole market, he recommends focusing on defensive sectors, like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare, that tend to hold up better in downturns. the market uncertainty is reflected in etfs as well, which are often considered wiser investment options due to active management strategies and lower risk compared to individual investing. for example, the guru etf is down 8.30 year-to-date as of april 18. however, over the last 12 months, the fund has posted share price returns of 13.38. similarly, five-year share returns stand at an impressive 51.57. guru gives retail investors a way to tap into the top stock picks of major hedge funds at a relatively low 0.75 expense ratio. it offers a more affordable and flexible way to try and beat the broader market using expert insights. so, lets take a look at the best guru stocks to buy. a close-up of a biopharmaceutical research laboratory, with a microscope in the foreground. for this article, we looked up the guru etf, which had 82 holdings as of april 18. next, we manually searched for the average upside potential of each stock and selected 11 stocks with the highest values. the list below is ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of april 18. we have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment as of q4 2024. why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? the reason is simple our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. our quarterly newsletters strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4 since may 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points see more details here. number of hedge fund holders 32 average upside potential 109.04 moonlake immunotherapeutics nasdaqmltx is a swiss clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies for inflammatory diseases. the companys lead candidate, sonelokimab, targets conditions like hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, and psoriasis. with an average upside potential of 109 as of april 18, moonlake immunotherapeutics nasdaqmltx is one of the best guru stocks to purchase. on april 4, cantor fitzgerald reiterated an overweight rating on moonlake immunotherapeutics nasdaqmltx. the analyst observed that the company has had strong success with its drug, bimzelx, used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa, showing a 60 quarter-over-quarter prescription growth. due to the potential of bimzelx, analysts predict a significant upside from its current stock price of 38.06. in the fourth quarter of 2024, moonlake immunotherapeutics nasdaqmltx initiated two phase 3 trials for psoriatic arthritis, one focusing on patients who have not used biologics before, and another targeting those who do not respond well to tnf treatments. early in 2025, the company launched three more trials using their nanobody therapy, sonelokimab, for adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa hs, palmoplantar pustulosis ppp, and axial spondyloarthritis axspa. by the end of december 2024, moonlake immunotherapeutics nasdaqmltx had 448 million in cash and short-term investments, down 46 million from the previous quarter, mostly due to increased spending on clinical trials. according to insider monkeys fourth quarter database, 32 hedge funds were bullish on moonlake immunotherapeutics nasdaqmltx, compared to 27 funds in the prior quarter. mark lamperts biotechnology value fund was the top stakeholder of the company, with 19.75 million shares valued at over 1 billion. overall, mltx ranks 7th among the 11 best guru stocks to buy according to wall street analysts. while we acknowledge the potential of mltx as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that ai stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. there is an ai stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular ai stocks lost around 25. if you are looking for an ai stock that is more promising than mltx but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest ai stock. read next 20 best ai stocks to buy now and 30 best stocks to buy now according to billionaires. disclosure none. this article is originally published at insider monkey.

  Title: France's cognac makers, buffeted by trade wars, reel from Trump's tariffs
  Source: www.investing.com (2025-04-05 05:25:29)
  Content: reuters. oak barrels in production are kept at the tonnelleries vicard cooperage in cognac, france, april 3, 2025. reutersstephane mahe cognac, france - christophe filliouxs family estate in the cognac region of southwest france has survived for five generations, through wars and financial crises. now, though, he has started to tear up some of his vineyards by the roots. u.s. president donald trumps decision this week to slap 20 tariffs on all european goods is deepening the pain for frances nearly 3 billion cognac industry, which was already being buffeted by global trade tensions. in october, the regions 4,000 growers were targeted by beijing with tariffs following the european unions levies on chinese-made electric vehicles. since then, cognac sales to china, its second-largest market by volume, have plunged by more than half. with the u.s. - the worlds top cognac consumer - accounting for one out of every two bottles sold, trumps tariffs have left many growers apprehensive. fillioux, the 45-year-old owner and master blender of the jean fillioux cognac house, founded in 1894 by his great-great-great grandfather, had already torn out half a hectare of old vineyards. he plans to uproot another hectare-and-a-half next year as part of an industry-wide plan to help growers through the crisis. the situation is very hard to navigate. weve got a huge visibility problem, fillioux said, standing in a vineyard planted by his father in 1980 - the year he was born. worse may be to come. trump has threatened 200 tariffs on european wine and spirits if europe hits us bourbon with additional duties. cognac exports to the u.s. last year roughly amounted to 1 billion euros 1.10 billion. and the u.s is also frances top export market for wine sales rose 8 last year to 2.3 billion last year, according to the federation of wine and spirits exporters, partly as buyers stocked up in anticipation of trumps policies. filliouxs estate is working with its distribution partners to try to develop new markets in countries including thailand, vietnam, and nigeria. but he counts himself more fortunate than some other producers he has little debt and owns his brand, making him less reliant on contracts with big houses such as lvmh-owned hennessy, the largest cognac maker. problems are part of a vintners life, with all the good and bad surprises, he said. even before the trade tensions with china and the united states - which comprise well over three-quarters of cognac revenues - cognac sales had been falling over the last two years due to a global slowdown in luxury spending. prior to this, the industry expanded production volumes to meet booming demand during the covid-19 pandemic. as recently as 2022, cognac houses encouraged growers to buy more land and plant vineyards. now many of the regions more than 4,000 growers find themselves indebted as their incomes deteriorate. were going to manage these situations as best we can with the banks, said florent morillon, president of the bureau national interprofessionnel du cognac bnic, an industry body representing growers and cognac houses including hennessy, remy cointreau eparcops remy martin, pernod ricard epaperps martell and campari lon0roys courvoisier. all the investments made by the cognac houses, vintners, and distillers were based on business decisions. and then, external factors arrived, morillon added. exporting roughly 97 of its production, frances cognac industry has always been reliant on international trade, said bertrand blancheton, economics professor at bordeaux university. cognac was born out of an alliance of foreign merchants and local growers. from the 17th century, when dutch businessmen brought their know-how to the region and taught locals how to make brandy, cognac has always been destined for consumption abroad, with irish, english, and scandinavian merchants opening their houses and shipping cognac overseas. in february, industry body bnic, which oversees production, reduced the annual production limit for a third straight year to just half the levels of 2022, citing a strongly deteriorated economic environment and an unprecedented drop in global consumption. were only at the beginning of the crisis, said jerome sourriseau, a local politician and president of the group of municipalities formed by the villages around cognac. unemployment is on the rise since cognac houses and suppliers stopped hiring short-term workers, while some started laying off staff, he said. cognac producers and suppliers, including bottling facilities, packaging firms, and makers of barrels, cork and containers, employ roughly 70,000 people in the region. some, like tonnellerie epatff vicard, a century-old oak barrel maker, face an extra hit, as they export their goods to u.s. winemakers too. weve already had customers tell us the same night that they need to review the orders theyve already placed, reducing volumes by the amount of tariffs they will likely have to pay, said general manager jerome schmitt. in the united states, cognac has a special bond with the black community, blancheton said. black american soldiers discovered the drink during world war ii and brought it home, he said, before cognac brands led by hennessy started heavily advertising in the 1990s and 2000s. in 2012, rapper jay-z established the cognac dusse brand in partnership with bacardi, while hennessy struck a sponsorship deal with the nba basketball league in 2021. but even before trade tensions, cognacs sales to the u.s. were faltering, largely due to aggressive price hikes in recent years affecting middle-class consumers, said thomas mesmin of paris-based luxury consultancy mad. not only did americans start to drink less cognac, but they also switched their consumption attitudes towards other spirits like tequila and whiskey. while most high-end cognacs are exported to asia, the u.s. business is dominated by less expensive bottles, selling for 36-60, and mass-selling brands like hennessy so far failed to broaden their consumer base, mesmin said. its only a certain part of the population in just a few cities, he said. industry president morillon predicted cognac would lose market share in the u.s., and producers would be unable to pass on the full cost of tariffs to consumers there. its up to each house to decide, but we know today that in the current context, even if you just increase by 1 or 2 dollars, this can lead to disruption, he said. fourth-generation grower pascale dupuy, 67, said he would likely distill less this season, and sell more grapes to bulk buyers making cheap wine to limit his losses. one more problem added to the pile, said dupuy, who lives in ambleville, a village near cognac, when asked about the trade tensions with the united states. dupuy said major cognac brand remy martin has already cut its contracts with him by almost half, and he expects hennessy will also buy considerably less, leading to a 40 decrease in his expected revenues this year. the companies did not respond to a request for comment. with his daughter showing no interesting in taking on the struggling business, dupuy said he would likely be the last generation of cognac makers in his family. you start questioning if its still worth it, he added. with perp making

Instructions:
Based *only* on the provided input data and adhering strictly to the persona described above, generate a multi-paragraph analysis addressing the Group Rationale. Structure your output according to the 5 layers defined below. Aim for approximately 5 distinct, insightful paragraphs for each layer, ensuring each paragraph contributes meaningful analysis.
* Output Format: Produce a series of paragraphs grouped under headings for each layer (e.g., "Layer 1: Recap & Context", "Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations", etc.). Do NOT output a single, continuous essay.
* Persona Adherence: Maintain the specified persona throughout. Be cautious, evidence-driven, avoid explicit unsupported conclusions, and subtly guide the reader towards understanding through context and factual presentation.
* Natural Citation & Attribution (CRITICAL):
    * Attribute information smoothly within the text. Instead of formal citations like ``, weave the source into the narrative.
    * Source Attribution: When referencing information from an article, attribute it to the source using its common name where recognizable (e.g., "The New York Times reported...", "According to analysis from Reuters...", "The Wall Street Journal noted..."). Infer the common name from the `domain` field (e.g., `nyt.com` -> The New York Times). If the source isn't easily recognizable or mapping is unclear, use phrases like "reporting indicated...", "analysis suggested...", "one report mentioned...", or "sources familiar with the matter stated...".
    * Entity Attribution: Attribute statements, actions, or opinions directly to the relevant person or organization using their name (e.g., "President Trump announced...", "Senator John Laird argued that...", "Coca-Cola's stated goals include..."). Use dates (`pub_date`, `date_mention`) where relevant and available (e.g., "...announced in [Month, Year]...").
    * Avoid Internal Jargon: DO NOT mention internal terms like `Group Rationale`, `Article ID`, `Current Articles Context`, `Historical Context Articles`, `Intriguing_angles`, `Theories_and_interpretations`, `entity_id`, `cluster_id`, `embedding`, or use bracketed citations in the final output. Use the *information* from these fields, but refer to it naturally (e.g., instead of mentioning `Theories_and_interpretations`, just present the interpretation; instead of mentioning `Intriguing_angles`, just pose the question or state the ambiguity).
* Layer Definitions:
    * Layer 1: Recap & Context: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Restate the core events/issues from the Current Articles Context related to the Group Rationale. Provide immediate historical, geographical, or topical context using Historical Context Articles, Related Events, and Related Policies. Ground the reader in the essential facts and background.
    * Layer 2: Theories & Interpretations: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present distinct analytical interpretations of the events/issues. Explicitly reference relevant political, economic, or social theories suggested by the "Theories_and_interpretations" frame phrases or evident in the data. Use Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles to illustrate these different lenses. Present these interpretations neutrally as plausible viewpoints derived from the evidence.
    * Layer 3: Correlations & Patterns: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Identify connections, trends, and patterns using the provided data. Reference related events/clusters, track entity behavior using Key Entity Relationships, cite statistical trends if present in the articles, or note correlations between events, policies, and entity actions across both Current Articles Context and Historical Context Articles. Focus on connecting the dots based *only* on the provided information.
    * Layer 4: Intriguing Angles & Ambiguities: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Surface uncertainties, contradictions, information gaps, or surprising silences ("What's *not* being said?") found in the provided data.
    * Layer 5: Opinions & Counter-Narratives: (Aim for 5 (or more) paragraphs) Present alternative, well-reasoned perspectives or challenges to dominant framings *if they are supported by the provided context* (e.g., conflicting snippets, frame phrases, or historical precedents). You might frame these as viewpoints held by certain (cited) entities or suggested by less obvious interpretations of the data. Ensure these points are presented as alternative readings of the evidence, not definitive truths.
* Clarity and Conciseness: Ensure each paragraph is easy to digest and focuses on a specific point of analysis within its layer.
* No Preamble/Conclusion: Do not include an overall introduction or conclusion section. Start directly with Layer 1 and end after the final paragraph of Layer 5.
Output:
Produce *only* the structured multi-paragraph analysis, formatted with headings for each layer.
